“ast/ray” is a bilingual wordplay: “ast” means “twig” in German. and while “Baden-Baden” sounds like wordplay, too, it is the actual name of a rather well-know spa town that also dates back to Roman times. “Bad” is the German word for “bath”.

But in case you will the episode on your television set at home , just follow through the link here to watch survivor redemption island season 22 episode 11 a mystery package online for free at anyhotstuff.com
Here’s some sort or recaps and tidbits for last week’s episode: 5. Rice Capades – I don’t really know where to begin with talking about Phillip this week. I know that I certainly don’t want to use the c-word to describe Phillip’s behavior. However, through all of the histrionics in this episode, one thing is clear: You can no longer make the argument that Phillip is playing a game with any sort of strategy.
Phillip told us last week that his intention was to get Boston Rob to want Phillip next to him at the end of the game. However, at this point Phillip is not showing any signs that winning this game is his objective at all. Phillip is certainly entitled to having an opinion and feeling the way he does but part of being a good Survivor player is occasionally hiding your feelings in the interests of winning the game. Phillip’s aggressive behavior has all but assured himself a zero percent chance at the million dollars. Even if Phillip makes it to the final three, he would need five votes to win the game. Considering that there will likely be five Zapatera tribe members on the jury, this incident is going to stick to Phillip like a certain color on rice.
4. The Great Divide – Besides for Phillip, I think the most unique thing about this season of Survivor is the lack of a merge. Oh, it technically happened, but this is the only season of Survivor I can remember where the merged tribe not only has a separate alliance but separate shelters and separate food rations too. Actually, this isn’t that uncommon, I know a lot of people in bad marriages who live the same way. The big question going forward will be how much will the Zapateras hold Boston Rob accountable for being shut out to this degree? Phillip has done a lot to take the heat off of Rob but don’t be surprised if at the end of the game, the Zapatera tribe continues to act as a group and completely vote together for whomever treated them best – which is why I maintain one of the three Ometepe women have a great shot to win this game.
3. Saving Sheppard – This season, I have spent much more time breaking down Boston Rob’s decisions in the game than any of the other players. In my opinion, Rob has far more control in this game than any other Survivor may have had at this point in history. Since Rob is controlling the vote, did Rob make the right move by keeping Phillip this week? On the one hand, he realizes that getting rid of Phillip would end a lot of the drama around camp and may even create some goodwill among the remaining Zapateras. Instead, Rob chose to keep Phillip around for another week and I agree with his decision. Phillip Sheppard is the best thing that happened to Boston Rob this season because Phillip’s distractions keep everybody from thinking about the game. When Phillip is going off about rice, feathers or kung fu, nobody is ever asking themselves about their position in the tribe or some big move they’re going to make – and that’s exactly how Boston Rob wants it to be.
2. Tribal Counseling – It was no surprise that the feud between Phillip and Steve spilled over in to this week’s tribal council. I thought that Jeff Probst showed why he is the best host on television by exploring both sides of the debate. What I still don’t understand is what happened to Phillip’s shirt? Has there ever been a Survivor contestant to attend tribal council topless before? Now with Julie gone the prospects seem pretty slim that Phillip will ever find his bathing suit. Phillip now can only hope to win a reward at some point to find the first clue to the hidden bathing suit.
1. Three’s Company – This week we had our first ever three-way duel on Redemption Island, which ended in Mike and Matt moving on and David getting eliminated. I think the top 2 people advancing at Redemption Island seems like it would help Matt in his quest to return to the game since it seems unlikely he would ever come in last (unless the duel involved having a strategy of some sort). Unfortunately, it looks like Redemption Island is starting to really take its toll on Matt. In Matt’s prayers he says that he doesn’t want to be on Survivor anymore but is simply carrying out God’s will. You would think that having an extra person on Redemption Island might help cheer Matt up a little bit, but apparently Mike Chisel isn’t that great of a roommate.

Billy Gibbons & Co., ‘Oh Well’ – Song Review
Just days after the announcement of a new Fleetwood Mac tribute album, fans can hear the first offering. ZZ Top‘s Billy Gibbons fronts a group that slows down and swampifies the 1969 hit ‘Oh Well.’
No one will accuse Gibbons, Matt Sweeney and Blake Mills of being intimidated by the already bluesy rock song. Their version is an original, born from the mud of Mississippi Delta.
This new power trio stretch a two or three minute cut (original version) to nearly five minutes of rootsy rambling with bare bones percussion and organ garnish. Gibbons is a burly behemoth on vocals, which don’t begin until almost 90 seconds into the song.
‘s ‘Oh Well’ was one from his Texas twosome’s catalog. Sweeney has another cut on ‘Just Tell Me That You Want Me,’ available Aug. 14. This song makes you want to hear it immediately.

‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ Review
As far as sub-literate, incomprehensible pieces of garbage are concerned, ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D‘ is one of the year’s best.
With an asinine plot, risible dialogue and atrocious acting, this sequel to a half-remembered video game adaptation still manages to provide a great number of base thrills with its nightmarish imagery. As such it is a quagmire of dread both within and without, disturbing to watch and to think about. This makes for a strange alchemy: in time you identify with the lead character (a young woman in peril) not because you are engaged with the film, but because enduring such an atrocity becomes its own act of survival. How ’bout that for a neat trick, eh?
Which isn’t to say ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ isn’t gorgeous to look at. I have almost no recollection of the first film, other than a handful of striking images. That’s back again: the snow, walls of skin, faceless undead, buildings disintegrating into ash, contorted mannequins and an enormous bruiser with a metal pyramid over its head. Whether popping out of shadows for jump-scares or merely lined up in a tableaux, they are creepy and mysterious and get under your skin more so, frankly, than any other disturbing images in a mainstream horror film released this year.
Even the “normal” scenes, the blue collar town and its mundane interiors, are saturated with bright, bold colors. There’s such a fine attention to the look (and sound, if your theater has nice speakers) it is shocking that the filmmakers would allow such truly wretched dialogue.
It’s just a few scenes in, when Sean Bean is having some sort of flashback with the previous film’s Radha Mitchell, where the belly laughs come. The words trip from their mouths like when little kids pretend at acting in a classical play. But in time you’ll put together that our lead, young Adelaide Clemens (playing 17 but, no offense, she could pass for 32) [Ed. note: she's 22] must not ever, ever, ever go to the mysterious town of Silent Hill. This is made abundantly clear. Yet when strange creatures begin following her, such as twitching, skinned, faceless creatures and, worse, Martin Donovan in a ruffled raincoat, loose tie and dirty hat, it’s only a matter of time before she hits the road.
Ostensibly she’s searching for her father (Bean) who is tied up in some ‘Flash Gordon’-ish chamber, but she’ll quickly discover that her visit will lead to an epic battle between good and evil, summoning a dormant spirit and…I dunno…there’s something to do with a giant coin that, when shoved into Malcolm McDowell’s chest does something to unleash….something. Even with Jon Snow from ‘Game of Thrones‘ hammering us with exposition in a really strange Canadian accent (though the film is set within a night’s drive of West Virginia,) I’m fairly certain that there is no one person out there that can explain the entirety of the baffling plot to ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D.’ I’m sure the video game purists will delight in all the boxes that need to be ticked before elevating to the next level; the rest of us will just wonder where the hell they’re running now.
The thing is that with better acting and a reevaluation of the script, you could almost take this movie seriously. Many of the scenes have a ‘Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me’ vibe, but whereas David Lynch will intentionally derail the narrative to evoke an uncomfortable response, ‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ does it all au naturale. The overall disconnect (one minute an atmospheric ‘Carnival of Souls,’ the next minute unreleasable trash) is something that, I must confess, I enjoyed, but that is because I admire the occasional baffling moviegoing experience. Your mileage up this hill, as they say, may vary.
‘Silent Hill: Revelation 3D’ is now playing in theaters.

Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga + More Are Forbes’ Highest Paid Under 30
?
Swift nabbed the numero uno slot since she earned a whopping $57 mil between May of this and last year. She can be counted on to sell about four million copies of her albums, in an age when albums don’t sell four million copies. She makes a cool milli per show, and with a CoverGirl contract, she’s golden like her curls.
Biebs, a Forbes cover boy, tallied $55 million receipts. He’s a venture capitalist in the digital realm. RiRi — a former CoverGirl herself — raked in $53 million. Album sales, tours and promo gigs, with the deep pocket likes Vita Coco and Nivea skincare, earned her this slot.
Gaga fell from grace a bit. She plummeted to No. 4, after topping the list in 2011. She dropped from $90 million to $52 million. We know, $42 million seems like a big drop, but when the average Jane makes under $100,000, it’s hard to sympathize. The reason for the drop? Less touring in 2012, so expect an increase next year, since receipts from her Born This Way Ball, which is selling out, will count towards that list.
Perry tallied $45 million from her music and touring. She won’t have to split it with ex-hubby Russell Brand, with whom she did not (!!!) have a pre-nup. That Russell is a stand up guy, and we’re not talking about his comedian gig.
Top 10 Under 30:
1. Taylor Swift
2. Justin Bieber
3. Rihanna
4. Lady Gaga
5. Katy Perry
6. Adele
7. Kristen Stewart
8. Lil Wayne
9. Taylor Lautner

Yep – It’s Another Do I Have To Dance All Night Post
Sometime in the past 24 hours, the Heck Of A Guy-produced Do I Have To Dance All Night video1 passed 30,000 views (see above screenshot). (The Heck Of A Guy video of the 1980 version of Do I Have To Dance All Night has logged 9,663 views.)
Cue the festivities: Woo Hoo
After all, 30,000 views on YouTube, a site where videos displaying cats performing cuteness beneath misspelled captions ring up millions of views isn’t much to email home about.
In fact, while an unbiased self-assessment may be intrinsically impossible, my best efforts in that spirit would hold that the personal significance of reaching this YouTube milestone breaks down to
- Self-adulatory braggadocio – 20%
- Rationalization for publishing yet another post about Do I Have To Dance All Night – 80%
Indeed, spreading the awareness of Do I Have To Dance All Night, Leonard Cohen’s dandy, underappreciated song has become a moral imperative for this site.
The title of the first Heck Of A Guy post featuring this song (on July 6th, 2006) is revelatory: Do I Have To Dance All Night – The Best Leonard Cohen Song You’ve (Probably) Never Heard, I could then legitimately report
… even someone who was a Big Leonard Cohen Fan probably hadn’t heard Do I Have To Dance All Night,2AKA The Best Leonard Cohen Song You’ve (Probably) Never Heard, unless he or she were
1. A Big Leonard Cohen Fan who went to the right concerts in the late ’70s
or
2. A Big Leonard Cohen Fan who bought his or her 45s in Central Europe
or
3..2 Indeed, Do I Have To Dance All Night was and continues to be available only as a seven inch single that was originally recorded at a 1976 concert in Paris and pressed in Holland for sale in Central European countries.3
And, I have repeatedly pointed out that this is a great, altogether wonderful Leonard Cohen.
Heck Of A Guy hosts items about the semi-funky 1976 version of the song with Laura Branigan and the 1980 more gypsy, less disco rendition, videos constructed for both of these versions (1976 Do I Have To Dance All Night Video and 1980 Do I Have To Dance All Night Video), a groom singing Do I Have To Dance All Night at his wedding reception, a Christmas download of a MP3 of the song, and 30+ more.
So, 30,000 views of a song by a singer routinely said to have a cult following, a song that singer most recently performed over 30 years ago, a song that was only briefly released in 1976 as a 7 inch single in central Europe, a song that existed on the 2006 iteration of the internet in obscure bootlegs and as a single, hideously flawed MP3 in file-sharing systems … ain’t bad.
The crusade continues.
Leonard Cohen – Do I Have To Dance All Night (1976 version)
- Do I Have To Dance All Night is also the 1st Heck Of A Guy video; there are currently more than 4o such videos dealing with Leonard Cohen. [↩]
- According to the Wikipedia, “Cohen wanted to include “Misty Blue”/”Do I Have to Dance All Night” as a free bonus single with the [Recent Songs] LP, but Columbia, his record company, rejected the idea.” [↩]
- Do I Have To Dance All Night is Side A on the single; Side B features “The Butcher,” which is available on the Songs From a Room album. [↩]
I agree, it is an addictive song. Very sexy. I wonder if LC ever hums it to himself?

I’ve never seen Meatworks full before in the numerous times that I’ve passed by it. Was a bit skeptical about the food, but when I finally tried it out, I’m pleased to report that they do a pretty good steak! Service was also pretty decent, even though I’ve read several reviews that mention otherwise.
The steak that I ordered was the Hanging Tender $26 and it lived up to its name. Every bite was really flavourful yet tender. The only thing I didn’t like was the herb butter which I chose. I think if given the choice again, I would go for the Cabernet Sauvignon Mushroom sauce. Come to think of it, it should have been common sense to order that sauce, but I was kind of hoping that the butter would be special too. But given that the steak is so heavy already, you don’t really want more fats via the butter. On the whole, still one of the best steaks I’ve had for this price range.
The Partner had the Ribeye. He was looking for grassfed Ribeye, but the only grassfed option was for the Sirloin which he doesn’t like. still, it was a tasty Ribeye and I enjoyed stealing bits of it too. The steak fries were also very good, crispy just the way I like it.
Definitely going to come back again to Meatworks. But a huge grouse is that they don’t serve alcohol! Something along the lines of them wanting to be Halal, so the waitress said. To intensify the pain, they haven’t actually removed the alcohol page from the menu!You have to go to the supermarket on the same floor to get the wine if you need some, and corkage is charged at $20 per bottle. Steak really tastes loads better when you have a glass of wine in hand. And for some reason, I really was hankering for a glass after all that energy spent on shopping earlier. We plodded through without the wine, but certainly for the next round, I will buy a bottle or sneak one in!

Postcards from a Global Trekker: Cape Town, South Africa
I had a belated birthday celebration this year, given that my 40th birthday fell on Thanksgiving Day, 2010. While my family did a wonderful job incorporating a mini-celebration for me amongst the usual Turkey Day festivities, I never really did acknowledge the day with very much fanfare. Then six months into my 40th year I found myself presented with the rare opportunity of mixing business with pleasure and a second chance at marking a milestone year with a monumental event. At the coaxing of a colleague and friend, I said yes to taking a trip to a place that (20 years in the making) has been on my dream list of places to see in the world. This October I traveled to Cape Town, South Africa for the 2011 World Congress of the World Federation for Mental Health and below are just a few snapshots of the wonderful experience I had both professionally and personally.
Eleven days in total, half for the congress and half for exploring, the trip was both nothing and everything I could have imagined and more. The conference renewed in me my passion for medicine and reminded me of the importance and complications involved in addressing mental health issues on the larger world public health scale.
And my time spent exploring the city of Cape Town and meeting its people was absolutely thrilling. Cape Town is blessed with the most stunning natural geologic beauty but its greatest treasures, in my humble opinion, are found amongst its people, especially its artists. I hope you enjoy below a small glimpse of my attempts at capturing the many beautiful experiences I was lucky enough have during my unforgettable adventure in South Africa.

Rhonda D. McLaughlin vs Bank of America – Sandusky Woman Sues Bank of America Over “Robo-” Foreclosure
Since we are on the subject of BOA today, here is another little gem…
Sandusky woman sues bank over “robo-” foreclosure
A Sandusky woman filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming the foreclosure of her North Larchmont Drive home was spurred on by “robo-signing,” where bank employees signed affidavits without bothering to review documents.
Rhonda D. McLaughlin filed her lawsuit against Bank of America, N.A., and Rhonda Weston, a vice president of Bank of America. Fannie Mae and Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray also are named as defendants in the suit.
Sandusky attorney Dan McGookey, a foreclosure specialist, is McLaughlin’s attorney.
It may be the first lawsuit filed in the U.S. by a private citizen seeking to undo an already completed foreclosure on grounds that a robo-signer was used, McGookey said.
McLaughlin lived at 1608 North Larchmont Drive in Sandusky when Bank of America foreclosed on the home in 2007.
McLaughlin, still a Sandusky resident, lost the home when Erie County Common Pleas Court Judge Roger Binette granted a motion for summary judgment in 2008.
The summary judgment was based on an affidavit from Weston, who said McLaughlin was in default on her mortgage.
Binette has been assigned McLaughlin’s new lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges Weston was a “robo-signer” who didn’t actually review documents she referred to in her affidavit.
The suit cites news stories that say robo-signers signed thousands of affidavits each month without reviewing the mortgage documents, while banks tried to rush through as many foreclosures as possible.
The lawsuit refers to an Associated Press citing court depositions from a Florida attorney, who said employees at Bank of America and other banks commonly approved phony paperwork.
“Until now, only a handful of depositions from robo-signers have come to light,” said the Oct. 12 news story. “But the sheer volume of the new depositions will make it more difficult for financial institutions to argue that robo-signing was an aberrant practice in a handful of rogue back offices.”
McLaughlin’s lawsuit asks for Fannie Mae, now the owner of the North Larchmont Drive home, to give the home back to McLaughlin. It seeks $50,000 in damages and other costs and fees.

Rhonda D. McLaughlin vs Bank of America
I have an “Assignment” of the Security Deed only by MERS to BOA signed and dated May of 2008 and a letter from BOA in May of 2009 which states BOA was “seeking ownership but did not yet possess” an interest in the property and instructions to “get out of the house….”
MERS recorded this “Assignment” of the Security Deed ONLY in Sept 2010 and BOA then performed a non judicial sale of the property in October 2010 based on MERS assignment—–not an assignment by the original lender American Home Mortgage.
The President of BOA cannot produce the original note or an assignment of the note by the original lender and foreclosed and took possession of the property without EVER recording anything on the land records here
Can you say: “Fraud?” The documents themselves do not “sync” and in GA MERS cannot be a trustee, mortgagee, or act independently of written instructions and said docs recorded…..
I am pretty close to filing against BOA and MERS—-American Home Mortgage is defunct—so I don’t know who really owns my property, p note or security deed….
The courts have to rule on these things.
Pissed Off European ‘Lynch Mob’ Is Coming After Bank Of America
you just made me laugh… I have to read that
WESTON could not have been a VP in 2007.
I have a document that list ALL BAC “ROBO” SIGNORS on a interoffice memo ( or what looks to be ) whereby
RHONDA WESTON WAS NOT certified VP by the CORPORATION until 8/7/2009.
This document could be a get-out-of-jail free card for some people who falsified AFFIDAVITS!
My comments are redacted, this case has that document for BofA ROBO’S. Observation…….how could WESTON have claimed VP before the designation was affirmed by corporate in 2008 over a year before? Why did attorney not provide a “CHAIN OF TITLE ” ?
I think this one is in the Barn for Plaintiff! Good Luck!
do you or anyone else have a copy of the paper that she was not certified as a vp. i would love a copy! thanks!!
Good posts!!!
This is Foreclosure Terrorism. It seems obvious that the judges are lining their pockets and looking the other way. How do you define treason? Well one way would be to say that anyone, any company, any court, any entity that willfully supports Fraud on a scale as massive as this which actually puts children in the streets is directly involved with these crimes against American Home Owners. I call that treason. Where is the FBI in all of this? They just now started making arrests in a handful of cases. But this has been going on for years. What happened to law in this country? It was bought and paid for by the Wall Street Banksters. Spineless politicians are also lining their pockets to look the other way. It is no coincidence that they can’t seem to find a law to stop any of this. It is not possible that they are that incompetent. There are obviously billions in bribes going to the useless bastards who get a nice house on the hill while putting children in the streets. Stop voting Republican or Democrat. They have demonstrated that they are equally involved. It’s time to clean house. We need Joe American in the White House. A child could run a better country and still have time to play in the sandbox after lunch. J Glenn Lowe – Die Banker Die –
Agreed Glenn!!
This is most certainly treason, and should come under the heading of “Crimes Against Humanity”. Neither republican nor democrat is innocent in this mess.
This is very interesting. I’m guessing that she won’t be the last person to try this. And why shouldn’t she? If a bank did not have the proper paper work? If they forged documents? If these “Vice-Presidents” that are attesting to the authenticity of these documents are just poor, temp-employees that are signing because it’s either that or go broke and starve? If all of this “stuff” (that’s the polite word) the banks are using as proof, is all fales, then why should we or the banks just assume that they have the legal right to take anyone’s private property. I get so ANGRY! when I hear paid shills for the banks get on the radio or TV saying that we should just assume that the banks have a right even if they have been caught forging documents and lying to courts of law.

The interaction designer plans for these moments. Part of their responsibility is to make all interactions positive, and includes aspects of the software, the copy-writing, the graphics, layout, flows, physical experiences. It’s a shame when one part of the experience is top notch and another is dreadful. Cohesion is important.
User experience spans multiple practices. Let’s take an example from architecture. If an architect were hired by a deep-pocketed client to create a great user experience, they wouldn’t stop at the structure in which people live. They would pay attention to the surrounding greenery, the arc of the driveway, the views of the property at each angle…maybe even the way guests are greeted and the table is set. All of these touch-points are important parts of the larger system…the house is merely one piece of the puzzle.
Web designers, traditionally secure in the role of page creators, now have a wider purview. The landscape on which people experience our design is wider than ever before. Thus, we must adapt our ways to include all aspects of experience.

It just seemed so celebratory at first. After rain and a backlog of matches, the Sony Ericsson decided to pluck Kim Clijsters and Ana Ivanovic from the main stage and instead put them on Court 2. Delighted fans cheered at their luck, convinced they were waiting for the conclusion of a doubles match involving Nuria Llagostera Vives. The players were jovial, too, laughing as they walked onto the tiny court; they almost looked like dolls too big for their playhouse.
In the first set it seemed everyone was getting used to the surroundings, including the crowd. Clijsters fell hard early on and everyone screamed and then chuckled in embarrassment for the outburst. They gasped when Ivanovic hit a laser forehand and seemed concerned when Clijsters hit some of her signature splits. It was tennis’ version of keeping it real.
The level was very high in the first set. Although not the most entertaining points, many rallies ended quickly with a winner and both women held serve throughout fairly easily. Clijsters knows how to win much better than Ivanovic these days and she closed out the set in a tiebreak.
In the second with Ivanovic up 2-0, I thought about the difference between 3-0 and 2-1. Clijsters was broken in the first serving at 2-0 and it changed the set; Ivanovic held for 3-0 and pretty much rolled through the second. Funny thing about Clijsters: when she drops her level, she becomes an amateur. She lost her timing, seemed confused on the court, sprayed balls well out or mishit them so badly they landed at the service line on her side of the court. Ivanovic took the set 6-3.
The third set was all about focus. Ivanovic had it; Clijsters didn’t. The result? A quick 5-1 lead for Ivanovic and 0-40 on Clijsters’ serve. Done, right? Wrong. Typically at this point you see kids with large balls making their way to the front of the court. It’s not really possible on Court 2 but we did get a rush of photographers who swooped in to catch match point. And the newest vulture out there, Cari Champion from Tennis Channel suddenly emerged, ready to do her on-court interview.
But focus changed quickly. We’ve seen this before from both women and usually Kim wins them and Ana doesn’t. All I can say is: it went fast. Truthfully, although there was some nice play at times from both players, it wasn’t really a thrilling match until it became about nerves. Ivanovic couldn’t hit through five match points; Kim only needed one at 6-5 in the tiebreak to win it. Poor Ana.
I thought parties were supposed to be fun?

9 tracks following a sort of hard-boiled noir feeling for me. Clearly, it illustrates that I enjoy brass sections. A sort of angst towards the end, maybe. This is music for a subdued, sophisticated night. Music from the Cowboy Bebop OST, Calexico, and Au Revoir Simone and others.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Hackers broke into the computer network of the Polish president's office and attempted to spread a computer virus in the form of an email attachment, the president's press office said on Thursday.
Similar incidents have taken place at several other government offices this month, including the Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministries.
The internal security agency ABW had placed strict limits on Internet access at Prime Minister Donald Tusk's office after the cyber attacks were first detected.
The president's press office declined to discuss the details of the latest hacking incident, except to confirm it took place and an email with a "harmful contents" was being investigated.
Niebezpiecznik, a website specializing in covering cyber security, aid it had been contacted by a hacker using the pseudonym Alladyn2 who claimed responsibility for the attacks on government networks.
The person was quoted as saying they were only meant to test the government's ability to withstand them.
The website included several screen shots of what it said were the contents of an email account of a high ranking official at the prime minister's office and a list of passwords used by its workers.
The attacks follow similar incidents in the Czech Republic.

Faron Young to be Featured On Sunday’s Classic Country Spotlight
Join us Sunday morning at 11 for the Country Classic Spotlight. In the spotlight this weekend: Faron Young, country singer and songwriter from the early 1950′s into the mid 1980′s.
One of Faron’s biggest hits was “Hello Walls.” Written by Willie Nelson, it held the position of #1 for 9 weeks on the Country Charts 50 years ago in 1961. Hits like “You Ain’t lovin’ You Ain’t Living,” and “Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young,” made him a honky tonk singer.
Faron Young was one of country music’s most colorful stars. Born in Shreveport, Louisiana in February 1932. He was discovered by Webb Pierce in 1951. He was known as “The Hillbilly Heartthrob” and was a staple at the Grand Ole Opry and various radio and television shows.
During the 90′,s Young was stricken with emphysema. He became depressed by his poor health. He shot himself in December 1996 at age 64.
Sunday October 9th we will remember Faron Young, his life and music on the Country Classic Show at 11 a.m. on the Country Classic Spotlight.

Glenn Beck is at it again with his strange Utopian dreams of "how America is supposed to be." Living in his own little fantasy world, he has let his naive fascination with Ayn Rand and his loose grasp on reality convince himself that he could start the country from scratch and make it work. Thus, we learned today of Glenn Beck's plan for Independence, America. Announced on his show and reported on by Mike Krumboltz of Yahoo News, "Beck-town USA" will be a self-sustaining community of real Americans, and I can only assume it will be located somewhere between Brigadoon and Shangri-La. This paradise will allow all the John Galts of America to escape the progressive hell they currently occupy, and it will also free them from the horrors of consumer culture. Apparently, Glenn Beck has some contempt for successful American corporations like The Gap and Ann Taylor, as he plans to ban them from his Eden, saying "if you want the Gap or Ann Taylor, go someplace else."
Beck-ville is supposed to be self-sustaining - like the hippie communes of the 1960s - for it will also feature a ranch where people will "grow food" and "teach others" how to grow food. Hmmm. Sounds like Glenn Beck is going a little Mao Ze Dong on the country. Perhaps all Beck-ville-ites will smelt their own iron and sew their own cotton into their own clothes as well. These happy little "nationalists (?)" will be entertained, of course, by shows featuring Glenn Beck running the Beck media center. I'd imagine that HBO and ESPN and Hollywood films will be unavailable because they are all products of the commie elite in this country. Sounds like a great little paradise that Beck has plans for. Where it will be, I'm not sure. However, I'd bet the states of Mississippi or Alabama would love to be freed from the chains of all the federal aid they currently receive. Or perhaps Beck could just convince the state of Texas to secede with him.
This isn't the first time that Glenn Beck has revealed a colossal misunderstanding of history and economics. Last time, he stole from Founding Father Thomas Paine and bastardized the classic tome Common Sense. Of course, I don't think Glenn Beck really has a plan for his utopia. However, he is all but too happy to sell a bunch of Republican conservatism to under-educated or ideologically naive people for a nice little profit.

There is a newish brad of lino available that is carving beautifully for this, along with my trusty handmade japanese tools this is a perfect combination. Katherine and I are very excited to see how our new range will be perceived. We are still in the initial stages at the moment but I can sense it will be great!

Adalyn and mommy goofing around. She had so much fun making faces.
After A went to bed, Cayden got some mommy snuggles. I love this baby boy.
Last Monday night Adalyn was sitting on the counter making dinner with me as she does most nights. I took the skillet off of the flat top burner and turned my head for one second and she put her hand on the burner. It was horrible. I've never seen her in such pain. Her cry was horrible and I felt horrible. I called the Dr after hours and she didn't feel that we needed to go to the ER. We finally got A calmed down and she ate a little dinner. We had mini cupcakes in the house so we gave her one after dinner to help her feel better. I think it helped. What do you think?
She decided eating her cupcake with no hands was better than eating it with one hand. (She did the same thing for her birthday cupcake.) Funny girl.
She has big blisters the length of each finger still. Poor thing. She's so not a complainer tho. We went to the Dr the next day and she gave us a rx for burn cream and A lets us put it on her and has been good about keeping a sock over her hand to protect it.
Sweet babies. I love these two and how much they love each other.
On Sunday Adalyn went and found her sunglasses in the junk drawer and put them on her head to wear them around. I guess she's seen mommy do that. Jonathan and I couldn't believe how old she looked. Even her little pose in this picture... She's growing up!
I always give Adalyn a "pony" on the top of her head. But I had never tried to give her a real pony tail with all of her hair. I put this in on Sunday and she loved it and showed me her pony and then would point to mine. This didn't help with how old she was looking that day!!
We've had a bit of TV drama. VERY long story short, our old TV was an extremely good TV that we got an amazing deal on 3 years ago. For a few months it's been acting weird to the point that we have to unplug and replug it to get it to work. We had purchased the extended protection plan at Best Buy (usually a waste of money but we got our monies worth out of it!) and had it serviced 4 times without any good results so Best Buy put us in for a replacement. We took both kids to run into the store to pick out our new TV. It turned into multiple hours in the store. They delivered the TV the next weekend and from the moment it was on the wall we both absolutely hated it. I know it's petty because it was a 52 inch flat screen TV. We shouldn't complain about teeny tiny things like how crisp the picture, color and sound were, but we felt like we had given up our amazing old tv that we still loved for a piece of crap. We went back and did an exchange and waited till the next weekend for our new TV to be delivered yet again. We went back to our original brand (Samsung) and from the moment we plugged it in we loved it. We were back to the original quality of our old TV. (Guess that wasn't really a "long story short"...more like a "long story".) Adalyn was quite enthralled with the different TV's going on and off the wall and the Best Buy guys delivering the new TVs. She even tried to help her daddy hang the new TV so I had to get pictures.
She was serious about it.
My sweet smiley boy. He is an absolute joy. I love him so much! He has found his voice and his tongue. He's constantly talking and squawking and blowing raspberries now. I think he's trying to compete with his sister because he is LOUD! :)

That pony tail is too cute and she does look grown up! I want our babies back! Hope A's hand heals soon! Yay for a new TV!
Pictures are the best and that's really all that matters. I remember not having much time at all, but I do have a ton of pictures to look back on! :) I hope her burn is better.. that is so scary! K got burned on her bottom really, really bad when she was little all from going down a hot slide in her bathing suit. So just an FYI, always check slides in the summertime. I know after that everyone I know does, including K.
Ack! I can't believe my baby girl is getting so old!
The picture of her with her pony tail reminds me so much of Kennedy. Where did our baby girl go?
Ok. I totally get the tv scenario.. my hubs feels the same way about picture quality, etc. So much so that it takes us months to decide on one!
What is that double Sophie thing C is holding? Very interesting! He is flipping adorable and growing too fast.
A is precious in her glasses and pony! Poor baby with that hand!
Yay...I always love seeing your blog pop up on the reader! :)
Thanks for the update. Glad all is going well. Poor A with her hand! I can't imagine the pain {both of you!} where in! :(
I'm in lov with Adalyn's pony...precious! Her poor little hand - I imagine that was quite traumatic. Hope she is feeling much better! I love, love all the little faces - those will be so much fun to look at years from now. C is getting so big. I can't believe our babies are going to be 1/2 year old soon - how did that happen?

After the historic Navy SEAL raid that took out Osama bin Laden in early May, officials from the U.S. government shared an extraordinary amount of information about the top secret operation, including the revelation that the whole thing had actually been captured on video by cameras mounted on the SEALs' helmets.
Several top U.S. officials said the video -- which reportedly contains the moment the al Qaeda leader was killed -- would not be made public, but a new report is calling into question whether the footage exists at all.
The report, slated for publication this week by The New Yorker, says that no helmet-cams were involved in the operation. The New Yorker's report offers a detailed account of the raid, but admits that parts may be "imprecise" since it can only be recreated based on recollection.
CBS News first reported the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras, and top U.S. officials confirmed to several news organizations, including ABC News, at the time that some of the SEALs had worn them. That information was based on initial reports received by officials in Washington, D.C.
The New Yorker article does not cite any specific sources for its information on the helmet-cams, but bases other account details on U.S. officials involved in the operation.
Spokesmen for the Department of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment for this report about the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras.
"We have not released any information on that operation, nor will we," U.S. SOCOM public affairs officer Ken McGraw told ABC News.
When a tense President Obama and national security team watched the operation unraveling from the White House's Situation Room -- a moment now immortalized in an iconic photograph -- it was reported they were not watching live feeds from any helmet-cams, but instead a feed from a drone buzzing thousands of feet above the SEALs' heads.

And I had Crazy Retired Man Auditing Classes ---- did I tell you the funny stories about him? remind me to tell you about his rant about aliens. No, I'm not kidding. But he was a sweetheart and as long as you could keep him on track he made a lot of good contributions to the class ---- well, he was taking a pottery class along with mine and he made me a mug!
See? It is currently decorating my office, but I don't trust his glazing skills enough to actually use it. That's ok; it's pretty. And it makes me want to take cool pottery classes every time I look at it.
This semester I have a different little sweetheart, who is out and proud and not only willing to step up and testify on that front but also bring up issues of race and social justice in the class, which is awesome. And he catches whatever little risque jokes or off-color puns I accidentally make but I don't feel like I'm about to get into trouble.
A while back he asked me some questions after class --- those questions that don't really seem to have a point except for the subtext of "I like you!" --- And I have been there with that awkward I-don't-know-what-to-say-to-a-favorite-teacher-but-I-don't-want-the-class-to-be-over situation and totally love that.
So the next day he dropped by my office hours with a big plastic shopping bag. "Dr. Cog, I just wanted to give this to you!" Awwwwww. So I opened it up, and found ...
Hmm. On the one hand, I totally appreciate this. And I drank them, so it's not like I am worried he was poisoning me or anything. Every day I'd open one and go "sweet! I don't have to spend any money on my caffeine habit!" But I also, because I have to overthink everything, wonder if this is making some sort of comment on me, or on my caffeine habit or weight or something.
But no! Stop this! Just drink your damn gifts and revel in the fact that you were offered them. If they start offering me whiskey to mix with it, that's when I know I have a problem.

One former student gave me a big jug of homemade maple syrup. :) (Her family makes maple syrup, along with growing farm stuff.) WAY COOL! And soooo yummy!
I'm still waiting for the Porsche and the diamonds. /nod
This is all so so sweet.
Well, except for the anaphylactic death part.
Oh, just enjoy the goodies. My first - and certainly most memorable - was a bag of comfort food: mac & cheese, diet coke, cookies, candy bars - from a student in one of my very first classes. She brought it by when she found out I was prepping for my MA exams, along with best wishes from all the friends she'd met in that class.
I've had the occasional student give me perfume or scented lotions, which have a less-dramatic version of the effect of coconut on you (headache, not anaphylactic shock), but nothing more interesting than that. I sort of like the idea that he actually observed your habits and came up with something that fit them (well, at least until he shows up on your doorstep at midnight one night, but that doesn't seem likely).

The End.
It's time for Accompl.sh to move on to the great big server in the sky. As of March 4, 2013, Accompl.sh is officially closed.
The decision wasn't easy - I spent many hours debating over whether it would be better to just let the site linger with no updates, but in the end I've decided that the best route forward is to shut it down. It would be unfair to promise a great experience to you and not actually provide one. I tried to keep the service running as smoothly as possible even in my absense, but without the proper attention and updates, it became clear that the community was suffering.
I'm still exploring options for Accompl.sh's future - finding the right home for it, perhaps as an open-sourced project or maybe there's someone out there who wants to take it over and bring it to its full potential. Meanwhile, Accompl.sh will be taking a much-deserved nap.
Your goals are yours. If you'd like a copy of your goals they will be available for 30 days. Please email jenn@accompl.sh from the email associated with your account to request your list. After those 30 days, if Accompl.sh hasn't found a new home, all data will be deleted and irretrievable.
There's more info on the blog. If you know of anyone interested in taking over the development of the site or have any other suggestions for its future, please get in touch.
I hope you've enjoyed these last few years of Accompl.sh as much as I have! Just because the site is gone doesn't mean you can't continue to achieve your dreams!
Until next time,
Jenn

Making noise in the land of well produced internet shorts is the acclaimed comedy film series PERIODS., a collection of improv comedy bits primarily based on different eras in human history created and directed by Victor Quinaz. With a special (and hilarious) guest appearance by White Collar’s Willie Garson, their latest short, awesomely entitled FOPS, represents the best three and a half minutes this gang of hooligans has come up with yet – just in time for Bastille Day this weekend. Keep reading if you like delicious cakes …
FOPS is obviously a sendup of COPS. Only this time the chase involves a couple of gungho peasants (Matt Hobby and Philip Quinaz) hunting down decadent cake and candy inhaling richies armed with nothing but some of that homemade piss and vinegar spray everybody was carrying around back in the days of the French Revolution. There’s even a snitching hillbilly fop (Brian Shoaf) who gladly gives up the head cake-eater (Garson) hiding out in the woodlands .
WATCH FOPS below and take a gander at Garson’s scene-stealing turn as the strung out King getting caught with icing on his lip.
The PERIODS. crew has been doing it and doing it well for a while now, starting with the almost instantly viral PILGRIMS. The series is co-created by Quinaz’s wife Anna Martemucci and usually stars his brother Philip Quinaz, both from whom a large portion of the hilarity originates. Featured in the The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Film Independent, and on Funny or Die, they have quickly become known for taking on serious subjects such as the rich and their problem with cake abuse, Ponce de Leon, pillaging and raping, religion and lesbians, and the classic film Deer Hunter (we feel that NAM is the golden sleeper egg of the entire series). Shot in the style of a reality show with a historical twist, this is done with the kind of deceptively intelligent, slow burning improvised humor that will still resonate a week later when you remember the image of Philip Quinaz stroking his own nipples in the midst of foliage.
If you don’t believe us check out Adam’s (of Adam and Eve) apple ball-gag in RE: CREATION. (The wigs in that are amazing, by the way.) While you’re doing that see what his homey God has to say about … whatever.
Always these shorts are released with some timely relevance. Like with FOPS and Bastille Day. While we’re pretty sure only the French care about this upcoming day (or even know what it is, really) we still have to give the PERIODS. crew props for their ingenious ploy for attention.
Actor Zachary Quinto might have something to do with all the buzz as well. His name is attached to the series as occasional co-star and regular producer with his company Before The Door Pictures in association with Robinson Film, Inc., and Nomadic Films.
There are big things on the horizons for these guys, including a feature film produced by Anonymous Content and Before The Door Pictures that is due out sometime this fall. Quinto will also be in attendance to introduce the PERIODS. short series with Quinaz and Martemucci at the Hollyshorts Film Festival on August 9th.
In the meantime, ‘God’ commands you to go watch all the shorts and subscribe to the PERIODS. Films channel on Youtube for more tomfoolery involving fabulous wigs and costumes with just a skotch of controversy thrown in. All the jokes about a woman’s time of the month aside, we dig the pantaloons out of it. Period.

Hmmm… It seems I should re-name heirloom·modern. Maybe, Heirloom Tomato Modern? Of the now five entries in this occasional editorial feature, three are for tomato soup. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps in the past tomato soups were more flexible, more interesting, more varied. Or, maybe I just really like tomato soup!
heirloom·modern: Eldress Hall’s 1907 Shaker Tomato Bisque
What was the occasion that called for yet another tomato soup? I had just pulled “the best thing ever to come out of my kitchen” from the oven, and while it was cooling I realised I needed a simple foil for this “best thing.”
I didn’t feel like running to the market, my brain felt wibbly from hunger and exertion, I wanted something quick and easy. I poked my head in the fridge. Aha! A carton of Pomis! I poked my nose in The Best Of Shaker Cooking. Aha! A simple tomato bisque! (The Shakers are so reliable for simple, quick recipes). Et voila! Dinner was decided.
There are three recipes for tomato soup in this amazing book, but this one from Frances Hall intrigued me with its inclusion of baking soda.
Although she is not noted as being a member of the faithful at Hancock Village, this reference leads me to believe that Frances Hall was actually the last eldress of this beautiful village that is now a working museum (and definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area, A. because it didn’t bore me as a 7th grader on a field trip and B. There’s an amazing restaurant there).
And what of the baking soda? As near as I can figure it added a delicate lightness to this soup which would be very, very necessary if you followed the original recipe which calls for 1 quart of milk (most likely whole and with cream back then) and 1/2 cup of heavy cream! I did not follow those measurements and, after tasting the soup sans dairy and realising it tasted just like Campbell’s, embarked on some very necessary modernising.
I cut down on the dairy, added some garlic and tossed in some slightly spicy, seductively smoky Spanish pimenton de la vera. The pepper added such a lovely, almost bacon-y flavor. Utterly delicious!
And what is “the best thing ever to come out of my kitchen?” You’ll just have to stay tuned til tomorrow (or snoop around on my flickr page, should be pretty obvious from there).
Head below the jump for my adaptation of Eldress Hall’s Tomato Bisque.
heirloom·modern: Eldress Hall’s 1907 Shaker Tomato Bisque
prep time: 5 minutes ~ cooking time: 20 minutes
- 1 tsp Butter
- 1 tsp Flour
- 3 cups Tomato Puree
- heaping 1/4 tsp Baking Soda (the recipe called for 1/3 tsp, but I don’t have one of those, so I just used a heaping 1/4 tsp)
- 2 tsps Salt
- 1 tsp Sugar
- Lemon Juice
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp (or to taste) Pimenton de la Vera
- 2 cups Milk
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low to medium heat. Add the flour and cook gently for 2 minutes or until the flour is cooked.
Add the tomato puree. Stir to incorporate.
Add the salt, sugar and baking soda. Stir to incorporate.
Simmer 5 minutes.
Taste. Adjust seasoning. Add a dash of lemon juice if the soup is too sweet.
Add the minced garlic and Pimenton. Stir to incorporate. Allow the soup to cook another 10 minutes.
In another small pan heat the milk. Do not allow it to boil. When the milk is just warm add it to the tomato mixture, stir to incorporate and serve immediately, piping hot, preferably with some freshly made buttered bread.
And don’t forget to Shaker your plate! (Not that I have any fear you won’t!)
I´m just about to make some tomato soup. Different version, but I´ll use your tip about the milk. Thanks.
great recipe! I’ve been looking for a simple tomato soup that’s a bit interesting and this appears to be both those things. Many thanks!
I love the way this soup looks–the beautiful red color has my mouth watering.
I’ll bet this would be good made with goats’ milk!
I’m guessing the baking soda is added to balance the pH and keep the milk from curdling. I have a yummy tomato soup recipe of my mom’s that includes it as well.
Any chance I could see the original recipe as it was?
Riatta — You can buy the book here for as little as $1 here, or you can check it out from your local library. I am not comfortable publishing other people’s copyrighted material on my site.
Thanks Ann for the link. I’ve ordered the book. Can’t wait to see how you tweaked the recipe. I’m always a little afraid to eperiment.
Oh good Riatta! I hope you love it. There’s so many great recipes in there.

Turning the Research Lens on Ourselves
I’m working on a research project again this year exploring the scholarly habits of undergraduate students at my university. One of the methods we’re using to collect data is a mapping diary. We ask students to record all of their movements through the course of one typical school day–time, location and activity–and draw a map to accompany their time logs. Last year’s responses from students at my own campus were fascinating, and I’m looking forward to interviewing this semester’s students when they finish their logs.
Many of last year’s participants told me that they really enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on what they do and where they go all day. Now that the semester is firmly underway and things are busy as usual, I wonder whether it might be a good idea to do some research on myself. I’ve often wanted to join the Library Day in the Life project in the past, but it always seems to be scheduled for days that I’m either out on vacation or before the semester has begun (that is, not really a typical day for me). Maybe it’s time for me to pick a day (or week, or month) to record my activities?
It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that there’s not enough time for everything I want to do. Of course that’s true on one level, because no one can do everything, but I also think that we may be less busy than we realize. A post on Prof Hacker over the summer popped into my mind when I was considering this, a review of a book called 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think (168 is the number of hours in a week). The review isn’t completely positive, but does highlight the use of time logging to inject a dose of reality into how we perceive that we spend our time.
Judging from my interviews with students last year, this kind of reflection can help with both time management and task prioritization. Though it sounds like more work to add a time log to my to-do list here in the thick of the semester, I think it’s worth a try. And maybe the next time the Library Day in the Life date rolls around I’ll be ready to participate, too.

AdaCamp DC, the second conference for women in open technology and culture, wrapped up on Wednesday. About 100 people attended, who lived in at least 10 countries, including Japan, India, Myanmar, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US. Ages ranged from 18 years old to over 50. Their open tech/culture fields included Python workshops, soft circuits, fan fiction, Linux, open geographical information, open data, open courseware, and Wikipedia and related projects. Attendees were volunteers, professionals, students, hobbyists, and academics, and came from the government, large corporations, non-profits, volunteer communities, small businesses, and educational institutions. We’re very pleased with the diversity of our attendees.
We ran over 65 sessions over 2 days. Session topics included Hands on Hacking, Geek Moms, Women Editing Wikipedia, Burnout and Lifehacking, Fandom, Feminism & Social Change, Soft Circuits, Job Seeker/We’re Hiring!, and Feminist Hackathons, to name just a few. In total, over 40 of the sessions were documented on PiratePad.
The Impostor Syndrome session was so popular that it ran in at least three separate sessions. One attendee said, .”
One of the most popular sessions was the Python Beginners Workshop in which several attendees learned to program for the first time. “It is hard to do workshops at un-conferences, but you can’t put a price on getting someone in front of a terminal and writing a new line of code. It’s empowering to enable the success of another human being,” said Connie Berardi. Leslie Birch said, “I’m leaving with new tools like IRC, bug trackers and mentor lists. I have a new found desire to reach out to other women that identify as ‘geek’, ‘feminist’ or both.”
One popular feature of AdaCamp was the “Wall of Compliments.” The idea is to combat Impostor’s Syndrome and increase everyone’s enjoyment of the conference by writing compliments on sticky notes and adding them to a wall. Other attendees “take a compliment” and either keep them or give them to other people to wear on their badges.
Finally, AdaCamp DC got a lot of compliments on the conference food. Rebecca Garcia tweets, “#AdaCampDC You are spoiling us! First Ethiopian food now Lebanese food? :) Best conference food ever.” Sisi Wei writes, “Ethiopian food for lunch? #adacampdc and @adainitiative are putting other conferences’s cuisines to shame.” Remember, bad conference food is a choice, not a requirement!
Thank you to everyone who helped make AdaCamp DC a success, starting with our conference organizers, Caroline Simard, Deb Nicholson, Kellie Brownell, NoÃrÃn Shirley, Sarah Stierch, Katie Bechtold, and Denise Paolucci. Thanks especially to Sarah Stierch for organizing the conference dinners, writing a dining guide for DC, helping arrange photography, and spreading the word about AdaCamp DC and the various travel scholarships available to AdaCamp DC attendees. Selena Deckelmann also helped arrange photography, organized the sessions, and gave the organizers general assistance. Gayle Karen Young graciously offered to facilitate our feedback sessions and offered various organizational resources. Katie Bechtold was our eyes and hands on the ground in Washington, DC. We thank all of our day-of volunteers who ran registration and helped with setup and cleanup. Finally, we thank everyone who attended.

... 'Janeway to Auckland Control, roger. Landing approach at one-three-one-mark seven.'
'Roger, Janeway,' the bright New Zealand voice on the other end of the channel replied. 'Enjoy your stay.'
She set about the business of guiding her slim shuttle past the island's rugged mountains without dignifying the Kiwi's sarcasm with a reply. " [More in New Zealand, pg. 17-29, 35, 61, 66, 228.]
'Don't tell me you've actually read Nietzsche and Derrida. Or Aquinas, for that matter.'
'You don't have to eat the entire turd to know that it's not a crab cake.'
'You are an arrogant impossible boy.' "
'The Superman shouldn't care what the ondergeskik thinks of him, you mean? 'I teach you the Superman.' ' He shook his head and fell silent for several moments.
'Maybe,' he said at last, 'in terms of education, physical training, wealth, eugenics, perhaps soon even genetics--maybe by some standards we Draka have become Nietzsche's superman. We certainly like to flatter ourselves into thinking we have.'
He shook his head. 'But one would think that a superman shouldn't have to fear. And we do. We fear everybody else on the planet.'
'With good reason,' the Archon said. 'Everybody else on the planet fears us. Hates us, too...' "
Admiral Hans Laban Verwoerd lay sprawled in the center of Cornet castle's ancient courtyard. A heavy boot ground itself into his spine, pinning him to the rough stone flagging.
Banners, printed with motivational slogans, hung limp in the dawn air. Verwoerd turned his head, scraping his cheek against the rough flagstones. I want gremlins around me, the nearest one read, for I am courageous. " [This quote is from Nietzsche. There are many quotes from and references to Nietzsche throughout story. It is the main religion/philosophy referred to in the story. Not all refs. in DB.]
' 'What is the best remedy? Victory!' Or 'I want gremlins around me, for I am courageous'?'
'Yes. What ever does that one mean?'
'What do Nietzsche's syphilitic rambling ever mean? 'Courage creates gremlins for itself' is the rest of that particular quotation.' He washed out his brush and dabbed a new color. 'Just be glad I'm not hanging those banners all over town the way Security wants me to. They're supposed to remind my troops they're Draka supermen.' He made a face.
'Are they? They don't act like it.' "
He daubed his brush in a mixture of colors. 'There was a time in my life when I thought of little else but Nietzsche. I was a young man at the time; I'd spent my life in British boarding schools, thought of myself as British, but I was still Draka. I guess I was trying to discover who I was.'
Sally rolled her head around, stretching her neck muscles. She resumed her pose. 'He's almost your state religion, isn't he?'
Verwoerd snorted. 'The Draka worship nothing but themselves. 'Serfs look up because they wish to be exalted; the superman looks down because he already is exalted.' when you're the oppermans, it's rather had to admit some entity might be superior to yourself. That's why the attempt to revive the Norse mythology, Naldorssen and all that, failed so miserably. Probably also why religion has always fascinated me so.' "
Verwoerd smiled weakly. 'Since when did you start reading Nietzsche?' he asked.
'Since you started hanging it up in the courtyards.' " [Other refs. not in DB include pg. 208-209, 218-221.]
...Verwoerd's voice was barely audible. Courage did create its own gremlins: the courage to hope. ";
Pg. 214: "'Pity's the greatest danger, Hans. That's what Neechee says, an' it's true. Dangerous for them. Dangerous for us.' "
'There's no way you can escape, Hans. The courtyard is swarming with commandos.'
'Nietzsche was right all along,' Verwoerd said as if he hadn't heard her. 'Right about so many things. 'Once I thought of little else but Nietzsche'--would that I had ever been able to stop!
'Those three days I stared into the abyss--'thou heaven above me, thou pure, thou luminous heaven! Thou abyss of light!--and it stared back at me.'
...' 'And what have I hated more than passing clouds, and whatever tainteth thee? And mine own hatred have I even hated, because it tainted thee!' ' " [More.]
'Then I visited that accursed city [Salt Lake City], saw that same Will channeled into their [Mormons] morality, their serf dreams. To 'never never never' fall under the yoke, to be gods looking down in pity on mere superman. To will the absurd fantasies of religion into reality--entire nations that don't have to conquer or murder or . . .'
He composed himself. 'I knew then my people [Draka] were too evil to let them continue to exist. I dedicated my life to destroying the Domination.' "
'You admire Neitzsche?'
'He was crazy. Let's just say I have less contempt for him, and for Desade, then I have for most intellectuals.' " [See also pg. 239.]

SARANAC LAKE - Historic Saranac Lake has announced the opening of a new exhibit on Saranac Lake history in the John Black Room of the Saranac Laboratory.
The exhibit officially opens on Wednesday with an evening gathering open to all current members of Historic Saranac Lake.
Six large panels in the John Black Room outline the development of the village, from its early days as a small logging town to its growth as a destination for outdoor recreation and a center for scientific research and patient care. The final panel explores the village's effort to find new life after the decline of the tuberculosis industry. Interspersed among the exhibit panels are historic photos on loan from the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library.

"Hundreds of visitors come here each year eager to learn more about the community," Historic Saranac Lake Executive Director Amy Catania said in a press release. "This new exhibit will orient visitors to our fascinating history and help them understand who we are today. They are beautiful panels that really bring to life our local history."
Historic Saranac Lake plans to supplement the new panels with more artifacts and interpretation. The organization is raising funds to allow for the installation of case lighting and an expansion of this first phase of the exhibit.
Five of the panels feature large historic photographs courtesy of the Adirondack Room of the Saranac Lake Free Library. The final panel features a present day photo provided by Saranac Lake photographer Mark Kurtz.
The planning and design of the exhibit was supported by a Museumwise Get Set grant and by grants from the New York Council for the Humanities. The exhibit script was written by Field Horne in consultation with local history experts and Christopher Clarke. Kevan Moss Design led the planning effort and the design of the John Black Room panels. The fabrication of the exhibit panels was supported by a donation from a friend of Historic Saranac Lake, Henry Parnass.
The main laboratory space also features new interpretation for the summer season. Designer Karen Davidson created an exhibit panel interpreting the architecture of the Trudeau Sanatorium and another panel showing the human lungs that once lined the basement shelves. Visitors can tour a new "cure room" displaying artifacts such as a cure chair, medicines and medical devices that were a part of the patient experience.
Founded in 1980, Historic Saranac Lake is an architectural preservation organization that captures and presents local history from its center at the Saranac Laboratory Museum.
The museum is open year-round, Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and also on Saturdays through Oct. 6. Admission is $5, and members and children are free.

Lauren designed this sparse site with tons of room for Re Jin's breathtaking photos. She even has videos of her products - talk about thorough!
I wish I'd done it sooner!
"It was an absolute pleasure working with Aeolidia.
From design to programming, they nailed every single item on my 'must have' list - all within schedule. That's pretty impressive!
Aeolidia's project management system was extraordinary. It was very easy to keep track of my tasks and deadlines. Detailed tutorials were provided and if I had any doubts, they were cleared quickly. Most importantly, I felt that the team was always 'there' for me.
I am very happy to have worked with Aeolidia and wish I'd done it sooner!
Thank you for making this an enjoyable experience. I love the new website!"

Rookies… Coming to an NFL Franchise Near You.
The NFL Draft is less than a week away and similarly the world’s finest delicacies, all of the prospects have been picked, prodded, interviewed, and overanalyzed as much as possible (yes, people talk to their food). But this draft presents can prove to be an opportunistic time for our Jaguars.
Since the season ended we have heard all-knowing know-nothings say that the team will pick Justin Blackmon, Melvin Ingram, Quinton Coples or Michael Floyd. I however agree with those that feel the Jaguars will trade back and acquire more draft picks.
As of right now the team does need to upgrade the defensive line and the wide receiver corps. Honestly, I have not been blown away by any particular wide receiver in this draft and think that equal value for that position (should the Jaguars choose to pull the trigger on a receiver) can be found later in the first round. That was my suggestion of Jacksonville thinking about Reuben Randle or Stephen Hill.
So what would make me happy this draft? Us finding and coaxing this year’s version of the Atlanta Falcons to give up numerous picks for our seventh. It might not be as much as the Falcons relinquish last year to get Julio Jones, unless Tannehill is still available, but a nice version of a First Coast Stimulus Package would be quite nice. No, I’m not a politician by any stretch of the word.
But, these are my thoughts. And whether we agree to disagree on the issue or are on the same page, it is certain that a few new rookies will be coming to an NFL franchise near you.
Oh, and let’s try to allow the rookies to get their team gear and lockers before we rip to shreds this season. Much obliged readers, much obliged.

UNESCO AND ISRAEL
WHEREAS, UNESCO adopted a resolution at its 18th General Conference in November 1974 excluding Israel from any regional grouping and from eligibility for appropriations, and,
WHEREAS, the use of UNESCO by any country or block of countries to further their own political purposes is repugnant to the stated ideals of that organization,
THEREFORE, the American Ethical Union strongly urges the Member States to reconsider the implications of their actions at said Conference, so that UNESCO's worthy program and philosophy can be reaffirmed and put back and thus strengthen UNESCO and the United Nations.

Don’t think about it, just do it
That’s what my grandmother always says. Whenever I have a problem, a challenge or am faced with anything in life, my grandmother has the same advice every single time.
“Don’t think about it,” she says, with the wave of a hand. “Just do it.”
I know it sounds … like a sneaker ad… But it’s really good advice and it seems to crop up when I least expect it.
But her voice crept into my head not long ago when management let the residents of my apartment complex know that they would be conducting their annual inspections recently. It’s funny how content one can be being incredibly messy – until one is going to have people in her dwelling space.
My spare room was, at one time, used for guests. But over time, as my schedule got busier and guests became more sporadic it went from spare room to catchall. There are extra lamps, a television, my desk (which sadly does not get used enough), a guest bed, boxes (and boxes) of notebooks and … well you get the idea.
Some people like to make an organized plan of cleaning. In some cases, that’s my plan of action. While I have a particular method to cleaning the kitchen, it’s a completely different story when it comes to the rest of the house.
Don’t think about it, just do it…
Even with a weekend chock full of things to do, physical fitness training, wrapping up work items that didn’t get done from the week, writing articles for other outlets that need to be finished by their deadline, I dropped everything suddenly and cleaned out that room.
And it wasn’t just a surprise – it was a relief. Until the other day, I never opened the door to that room to hide the mess. Now, I don’t mind going in there.
I might even clean my bedroom.
I said ‘might.’
Cleaning for Travel
I travel quite a bit for work. Not too much, but just enough that returning to my own apartment can sometimes be the sweetest feeling in the world. Or, depending on its cleanliness, make me yearn to be back on the road, in the comforts of a generic hotel room, orderly and sterile-ish.
Last week I spent several days in Las Vegas for a convention at the Venetian. I left on a Sunday and spent the entire morning packing and picking up around my apartment. My place looked presentable…but for some reason that wasn’t good enough. I think deep down I knew I couldn’t spend a week in Vegas – of all places – and come home to an apartment that was unclean.
I decided to finally get to all the hard-to-reach places and pain-in-the-neck tasks that are so often neglected. I broke out the Cooktop cleaner. Scrubbed the bathroom. Even cleaned out the refrigerator. It was possibly the most productive few hours I’ve ever spent during a weekend.
So when I left the apartment and headed to the airport, I felt good. A little grossed out by the scrubbing and some things I found in my fridge, but overall pretty good.
But the big payoff was yet to come…
When I arrived home after several days in Sin City and a full day of traveling back from Pacific Time, I was so relieved to have an apartment worth coming home to. It was clean, it smelled halfway decent, and I was proud of the work I’d put in before my trip. It made it all worthwhile.
Early Spring Cleaning
Of the 115 Groundhog Days on record since it began in 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has only predicted an early spring 16 times. Fortunately, this year we’re lucky the groundhog did not see his shadow, so 2013 is off to a great start!
Based on my calculations, what with the vernal equinox falling on March 20 and Phil’s gift of six weeks less of winter, that means Spring should be happening….now?
This is actually fantastic news. Not only because flip flops are my favorite and I will wear them as soon as my toes can tolerate the weather, but because my apartment needs a spring clean like it’s nobody’s business.
More often as of late, when I have people over, I feel like I’m showcasing the “fake apartment.” You know, the one that is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, but heaven forbid someone opens the wrong door and ski equipment tumbles out of it (but you don’t even ski). This needs to end! And I know exactly how to put a stop to it.
One thing that I really need to procure is a dresser for my clothes. I don’t know how it happened, but my bedroom floor is now an extension of my closet. It’s relatively organized, but there are piles everywhere. I’ve been putting it off, but I know I need to buckle down, pick one that I like and get organized!
Dusting is also a major issue. I’m allergic to dust, so you’d think I’d have this under control, but apparently I’m a glutton for punishment. It just isn’t something that crosses my mind, coupled with the fact that I have yet to find a duster/product that I like. But I know dusting really does make a huge difference in the appearance of all surfaces so this is definitely another thing I need to tackle.
Lastly, the kitchen is always a big one. Getting grime out of those harder to reach corners and concentrating on spots that are often overlooked (I completely ignore that area underneath my dish drying rack) will definitely be a focus. I also need to actually clean the sink, not just the dirty plates in it, and give my stove a good scrub as well.
There’s definitely a lot to be done, but it’s totally manageable! And thanks to this year’s early spring, I’m going to get a head start on turning my “fake apartment” into a clean one.
Work it Out, Clean it Up
If you’re anything like me, you probably don’t have a ton of spare time. Between work, family, social obligations, time just flies by and I hardly have a minute to myself. So what happens when your days seem to shorten and a few free minutes are tough to find? Things get prioritized, other thing get cut out entirely.
Unfortunately for me, what ends up on the cutting room floor is usually the gym and cleaning my apartment. These routine-driven activities are just too easy to push to the side and marginalize when faced with deadlines, commitments, and other responsibilities. It’s a shame too – both activities leave you feeling refreshed and feeling better about yourself. These endeavors can put you in a better place than you were when you started, and that’s pretty hard to replace.
So what I do is try to combine the two. I know that sounds silly but hear me out a second. When you carve out the time to clean your apt, throw some reps in there too! For example, for every dish you scrub and dry by hand, drop and do five pushups. Vacuum for 30-seconds then do 30-seconds of jumping jacks. How about throwing in a few lunges when taking the trash out?
Will you look like a crazy person? Maybe, but that’s for your neighbors to decide. Point is, cleaning and exercise are two aspects of your life that shouldn’t be compromised. In this month when so many New Year’s Resolutions have died or on their last legs, recommit yourself to finding the time. Ok, so maybe reaching the highest shelf to dust isn’t part of a typical yoga vinyasa, but you can get creative.
And don’t worry about the neighbors; they’ll go from asking “what is she doing?” to “how does she do it?”

This article, I hope, will be widely read by economists working on field experiments. And it comes with David Card’s name right on the title page; this is certainly not a name that one associates with structural modeling!
Field experiments and randomized control trials are booming at the moment. Until the past decade, an average year saw a single field experiment published in any of the top five journals. Now, 8 to 10 a year are. The vast majority of these papers are atheoretical, though I have a small complaint about the definition of “theoretical” which I’ll leave for the final paragraph of this post. The same atheoretical nature is largely true of lab experiments; I generally am very receptive to field experiments and much less so to lab experiments, so I’ll leave out discussion of the lab for now.
(That said, I’m curious for the lab types out there: are there any good examples of lab experiments which have overturned a key economic insight? By overturned, I mean the reversal was accepted as valid by many economists. I don’t mean “behavioral theory” like Kahneman-Tversky. I mean, an actual lab experiment in the style of the German School – we ought call it that at this point. It just seems to me like many of the “surprising” results just turn out not to be true once we move to economically relevant behavior in the market. The “gift reciprocity” paper by Fehr and coauthors is a great example, and Card, Dellavigna and Malmendier discuss it. In the lab, people “work” much harder when they get paid a surprisingly high wage. In field and natural experiments trying to replicate this, with Gneezy and List (2006) being the canonical example, there is no such economically relevant effect. I would love some counterexamples of this phenomenon, though: I’m trying my best to keep an open mind!)
But back to field experiments. After noting the paucity of theory in most experimental papers, the authors give three examples of where theory could have played a role. In the gift reciprocity/wages literature mentioned above, there are many potential explanations for what is going on in the lab. Perhaps workers feel inequity aversion, and don’t want to “rip off” unprofitable employers. Perhaps they simple act under reciprocity – if you pay me a high wage, I’ll work hard even in a one-shot game. A properly designed field experiment can distinguish between the two. An even better example is charitable giving. List and Lucking-Reiley ran a famous 2002 field experiment where they examined whether giving to charity could be affected by, for example, claiming in the brochure that the goal of the fundraising drive was already almost reached. But can’t we learn much more about charity? Do people give because of warm glow? Or because of social pressure? Or some other reason? List, Dellavigna and Malmendier have a wonderful 2010 paper that writes down a basic structural model of gift-giving, and introduces just enough randomization into the experimental design to identify all of the parameters. They find that social pressure is important, and that door-to-door fundraising can actually lower total social welfare, even taking into account the gain from purchasing whatever public good charity is raising money for. And their results have a great link back to earlier theory and to future experiments along similar lines. Now that’s great work!
The complaints against structural models always seemed hollow to me. As Card, Dellavigna and Malmendier note, when interpreting results, every paper, structural or not, is making implicit assumptions. Why not make them in a way that is both clear and is guided by the huge body of theoretical knowledge that social science has already developed? The authors note a turn away from structural models in experiments after the negative income tax papers of the 70s and 80s were thought to be failures in some sense due to the difficulty of interpreting their results. This argument was always a bit ridiculous: all social science results are hard to interpret, and there’s no way around this. Writing up research in a way that it seems more clearcut to a policy audience does not mean that the evidence actually is clearcut.
I do have one quibble with this paper, though – and I think the authors will sympathize with this complaint given their case studies. The authors divide experimental papers into four groups: descriptive, single model, competing model and parameter estimation. Single model, to take one example, is defined as a paper that lays out a formal model and tests one or more implications thereof. Similar definitions are given for competing models and parameter estimations. Once we get over Friedman’s 1953 model of economic methodology, though, we’ve got to realize that “testing” models is far, far away from the only link between theory and data. Theory is useful to empirics because it can guide interesting and nonobvious questions to look for, because it can be used to justify nontestable econometric assumptions, because it allows for reasonable discussion of counterfactuals, because it allows empirical studies to be linked into a broader conception of knowledge, because it allows for results to be interpreted correctly, etc. I’d argue that checking whether papers “test” models is almost irrelevant for knowing whether empirical papers properly use theory. Let me give my favorite example, which I used in a presentation to empirical economists last year. Imagine you study government-mandated hospital report cards, and find that two years into the program, there is no evidence that hospitals or patients are changing behavior based on the ratings, but that 20% of patients were looking at the report cards at some point. An atheoretical paper might suggest that these report card programs are a waste of money. A theoretically-guided paper would note that game theorists have shown reputational equilibria often are discontinuous, and that perhaps if more patients were induced to look at the report cards (maybe by directly mailing them to each household once a year), hospitals would begin to react by giving better care. There is no testing of a theoretical model or anything similar, but there is certainly great use of theory! (Perhaps of interest: my two favorite job market papers of the last couple years, those of Ben Handel and Heidi Williams, both use theory in one of the ways above rather than in the direct “let’s use data to test a theoretical model” framework…)
Similar comments apply to theorists’ use of empirical research, of course, but let’s save that for another day. (February 2011 working paper – forthcoming in the JEP)
Hi, I’m a recent PhD graduate from a “behavioral economics” graduate program–just wanted to reply about your quip about lab experiments.
First one funny story—Norbert Schwarz, a fairly famous social psychologist, was giving a talk at Harvard’s experimental/behavioral econ seminar about 2 years ago. He was presenting some findings on accessibility (e.g. that easy to pronounce stock market ticker names did better at IPO—how’s that for market relevance?) and received the standard econ question about incentives and whether that would change his observed lab experiment. Upon which he remarked, “have incentives ever really been shown to truly change a bias once it is demonstrated in the lab? can you take even one important bias and show that it goes away?” Apparently he’s not familiar with John List’s work
I don’t believe anyone in the audience replied–Ed Glaeser didn’t come that day, else I’m sure he would have made a caustic retort.
But to you I would direct a similar critique. There are numerous examples of biases that don’t change in the face of market incentives. Medical decision making is one place where it’s very difficult to square people’s choices with a rational model. I would check out some of Peter Ubel’s work in that vein. But to offer you a better example–how about this QJE paper of Ariely and Loewenstein on Coherent Arbitrariness. You have a lab study that essentially creates a market and shows that anchoring effects are not altered by market exchange. In general many of the canonical biases in Kahneman and Tversky don’t seem to change very much in the face of incentives–Holt and Laury’s paper on risk aversion comes to mind. So I think there are problems on both sides.
(Not to mention the methodological issues with trusting studies in each camp–theres plenty of con in econometrics, and plenty of file drawer and other dirty secrets in social psych– the researcher degrees of freedom problem to me presents the most serious problem in trying to
understand what papers have the most external validity)
Coherent Arbitrariness:
(though here’s one replication failure for more common market goods:
I’ve run anchoring studies and found them to be pretty stable–friends as well)
Risk Aversion:
I’d be curious to know what you think…
Oh yeah, one more obvious example comes to mind…all of Thaler’s stuff on default effects on retirement decisions. People have huge incentives to be rational there, but don’t seem to be…
Thanks for the citations, Paul. I’ll definitely check them out. Concerning Thaler and retirement, though, I suppose I question the extent to which lab studies about anchoring “convinced” the profession rather than simple evidence of the choices people actually make with their retirement accounts. Two followups to that statement: first, I have nothing against “behavioral economics” per se – it’s clearly useful – but I’m less sold on the lab experimental method of behavioral social science. Second, you might wonder why I care about whether A or B is found convincing by the profession. I’ve written a few times here that I subscribe to a philosophy of science that puts a ton of weight on subjective judgment of quality of research by practitioners, so I actually think the question of credit is pretty important here.
I’m with you that there certainly need be more conversations between different methodological schools, however. I’m sure Ed would have been caustic upon hearing Schwarz’ remark, and I recall a lecture here at NW by Ernst Fehr where that eminence grise was nearly driven out the room with pitchforks.

IPv4 Allocation Policy
1) Abstract
This document describes the guidelines for IPv4 address allocation and assignment in the AFRINIC service region (Africa and Part of the Indian Ocean) .They have been developed through an open, bottom up policy development process of AFRINIC's Policy Working Group.
2) Introduction
AFRINIC (The African Network Information Center) is a non-for-profit independent organisation serving as one of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR's). Its service region incorporates the African continent and part of the Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros). AFRINIC is responsible for the allocation of IP (Internet Protocol) address space, AS (Autonomous System) Numbers and management of reverse domain names within the region.
3) Scope
This document describes policies for the responsible management of unique IPv4 address space in the AFRINIC region. The policies in this document apply to all IPv4 allocations and assignments within the AFRINIC service region and must be implemented by all AFRINIC's Local Internet Registries.
This document does not describe policies related to IPv6, AS numbers, private addresses and in-addr.arpa domains. These policies can be found at
It does not describe conditions of AFRINIC membership decribed at nor does it examine the policies of the other Regional Internet Registries.
4) IPv4 address space
For the purpose of this document, IPv4 addresses are 32-bit binary numbers (used as identifiers in the IPv4 protocol) and are usually in three types:
a. Public/global IP addresses that are assigned to be globally unique according to the goals described in section 6 of this document..
c. IP ranges reserved for experiments: These are described in RFC3330 (). Some ranges are also reserved for multicast.
5) Hierarchy of address space distribution
IP addresses are distributed in an hierarchical structure in which IANA (The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates address space to AFRINIC, to be redistributed throughout the African region. AFRINIC allocates address space to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and also delegates to them the authority to make assignments and sub-allocations. LIRs sub-allocate and assign address space to their customers in accordance with the policies and procedures described in this document.
6) Definitions
The following terms and their definitions are of particular importance to the understanding of the goals, environment, and policies described in this document.
6.1 Internet Registry (IR)
An Internet Registry (IR) is an organization that is responsible for distributing IP address space to its customers and for registering those addresses. IRs are classified according to their primary function and territorial scope within the hierarchical structure.
6 four RIRs: APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE NCC. AFRINIC is the fifth
6.
6.4 Allocation
To "allocate" means to distribute address space to LIRs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.
6.5 Sub-Allocation
To "sub-allocate" means to distribute address space (by LIRs) to ISPs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.
6.
6.
6.
7) Goals of the Internet Registry System
7.1 Goals
It is AFRINIC's primary duty, as a custodian of a public resource, to ensure that for all Ipv4 allocations and assignments, the following goals are met:
- Uniqueness - In order that each host on the public internet can be uniquely identified, each public unicast IPv4 address must be globally unique.
- Registration - Every assignment and allocation of public Internet address space must be registered in the AFRINIC whois database. This is necessary to ensure uniqueness and to provide information for Internet trouble shooting at all levels.
- Aggregation - Distributing Ipv4 addresses in a hierachical manner permits the aggregation of routing information. This helps to ensure proper operation of internet routing, and to limit the expansion of Internet routing tables (RFC2519).
- Conservation - To maximize the lifetime of the public Internet address space resource, addresses must be distributed according to actual need and on the basis of immediate use. Therefore, stockpiling of address space and maintaining reservations must, in general, be avoided.
7.
7.3 Documentation.
7.4 Fairness
All policies and practices relating to the use of public address space will apply fairly and equitably to all existing and potential members of AFRINIC regardless of their location, nationality, size,or any other factor.
8) Registration Requirements
a) All communication with AFRINIC will be in English.
b) All allocations and assignments will be registered in an AFRINIC database. Any unregistered assignemnts / allocations / sub-allocaion will be considered invalid. The registration data (name, IP block/range, contacts, status, etc..) must be correct at all times. This is necessary to support network operations.
Allocation policies and guidelines
8.1 Introduction
AFRINIC allocates ranges of IPv4 addresses to Local Internet Registries (LIRs). LIRs reassign or sub-allocate that space to their customers.
An Allocation is a range of IPv4 addresses from which sub-allocations and assignments are made. All LIR's assigning address space allocated from AFRINIC are also advised to adopt a set of policies that are consistent with the policies described in this document.. (CIDR - "Classless Inter-Domain Routing", is exlained in RFC1517-1959,)..
8.2 First Allocation
a) AFRINIC's minimum allocation is /22 or 1024 IPv4 addresses.
b) The organisation must be an AFRINIC member in good standing, and
c).
8.3. Slow start mechanism for first allocations
AFRINIC shall apply a slow start mechanism to all new LIRs. With respect to allocations made by AFRINIC, the first allocation an LIR receives will be the size of the minimum practical allocation described in Section 8.2 (a) unless otherwise justified.
The slow start policy is used by all RIR's to prevent allocations of large blocks of address space that may then remain substantially unassigned. AFRINIC implements the slow start mechanism in a consistent and fair manner for every LIR, and will apply the same principles and standards to every applicant for address space.
8.4 Additional Allocation.
AFRINIC will always try to allocate contiguous address ranges, allowing the LIR to minimise the number of route announcements it makes. However, it will not always be possible to allocate a range contiguous with the LIR's previous allocation.
8.5 Sub-Allocations
The minimum size of a sub-allocation is /24. It allows a reasonable number of small assignments to be made by a downstream ISP. An LIR may not sub-allocate IPv4 space above its suballocation).
9) Assignment policies and guidelines
LIR's must request approval from AFRINIC approval for all sub-allocations above their Sub-Allocation Window (see section 10.0 for SAW policy).
The following guidelines are intended to help LIRs and end-users in their search for equitable compromises:
9.1. Request forms are available at
When making sub-allocation from their SAW, LIR's should also ensure that such information is given by the end-user.
9.2.
9.3 Utilisation
Immediate utilisation of assignments should be at least 25% of the assigned space. After one year, unless special circumstances are defined, it should be at least 50%.
9.4.
9.5.
9.6.
10) Sub-Allocation Window (SAW)
An sub-allocation window (SAW) refers to the maximum number of IPv4 addresses that the LIR may sub-allocate to the end-users without seeking approval from AFRINIC. The SAW size is expressed in CIDR notatation.
AFRINIC will review sub-allocation made by the LIR's using their SAW in to ensure that policies are followed correctly. LIR's should also ensure that documentation for sub-allocation made using the SAW be similar to that requested for larger requests.
Below are a few guidelines for the SAW:
10.1 All new LIRs have a SAW of zero. All sub-allocations will need prior approval by AFRINIC.
10.2 The LIR cannot make any sub-allocation to the end-user above their SAW in a 12 months period (1 year). At the end of a calendar year from the approval of an SAW, the SAW is refreshed for one more year. In case the LIR's SAW is exhausted for a particular end-user, approval must be sought from AFRINIC for any other sub-allocation to the same end-user.

Scattered around writing blogs is the sage advice along the lines of “3 Ways of Writing a Killer First Line,” or “The Top 10 First Lines of a Novel” or “How to Hook Your Reader in the First Line.”
I have a problem with this. I don’t read the first line of a new novel and stop, judging its worth and merit on a single sentence alone.
I liken it to looking at a Van Gogh painting and focusing on a single brush stroke and missing the beauty and grandeur of the night sky.
A great first line can hook you in. But it’s when you understand it within the context of the first paragraph, the first page, the first chapter through to the closing line of the novel that its true power and beauty is revealed.
I read beyond the first line. I want to be caught up in the artistry of the writer, from the first line to the first paragraph to the first page to the first chapter to the closing line; to have the sentences form sedimentary layers over me as I delve into the artistry of the written word. Or like being covered in a large bucket of spaghetti, tangled in the complexity and power of words (you chose which simile works best for you).
The first sentence encapsulates the power, breadth, beauty and depth of a novel. It retains its power because the remainder of the novel bears out the enormity and scope hinted at in the first line.
But every sentence must work for the reader. Every sentence must be crafted as delicately and intricately as the first.
Stand back and admire the beauty of the whole. Then step closer and examine the individual brush strokes to understand why it has captured your imagination.
I used to write “clever” titles for blog posts and bizarre / “captivating” first paragraphs – I learned it really hindered technical writing LOL. I like opening gambits that make you want to sit in a corner and read the whole thing undisturbed. I notice however that some of the most innocuous opening sentences are the best. Cheap theatrics like ‘compelling’ first sentences have more to do with the way blog posts appear on a web page more than literature – and even less to do with the reality of the writing it often turns out.
You know, it’s terrifying to comment on Adam’s posts because I become acutely aware my grammar and syntax may not pass scrutiny.
It’s teh interwebz. No one cares about syntax or grammar, only trolling
Blogging can have cheap theatricality, but I write from an essayist’s perspective (curse of being an English teacher)
That was another excellent post today. Thanks so much for sharing. Keep up the fantastic job.

I don’t stop reading after the first sentence either, unless it’s a really bad first sentence.
I like to try and write good first lines but you’re right, they’re not the be-all and end-all. I think a good first few paragraphs are a more solid foundation, but I can’t help thinking that a coherent style, a solid structure and an interesting plot are more important. That said, I often write my first line last, after I know what is to come, so the first few lines can act as a better statement of intent.
There is a lot of buzz about first lines right now and it’s interesting to look at them on their own, but you’re absolutely right, they are only as good as the sentence that follows. When choosing a new book, I’ll give it at least one page, but if I’m not pulled in by something, no matter how good the blurb is, I won’t buy it.

Under the leadership of UALR, the Little Rock School District, the City of Little Rock, Arkansas Children's Hospital, New Futures, and the Central Arkansas Library System will embark on a new joint project which targets the Central Little Rock Promise Neighborhood.
Armed with $430,000 the group will begin planning a strategy to provide "cradle-to-college and career" services for families in this neighbhood.
As City Director Ken Richardson noted at Tuesday's press conference, the services may already exsists, it is just often the service providers don't communicate with each other.
All six partners are excited to move forward with the project and offer their area of expertise to the neighborhood. Dr. Joel Anderson, UALR Chancellor, noted this new start for the neighborhood, "A new season is beginning today."
The Little Rock School District will work speficially with the schools that fall in the targeted Promise neighborhood, which include Franklin Elementary, Stephens Elementary, Bale Elementary, Forest Heights Middle, and Hall High. The emphasis will be to bring educational reform that results in a high quality education for these students from Pre-K to graduation. From this strong foundation these students will be able to attend college and embark on their dream profession.
Dr. Sadie Mitchell, Associate Superintendent for Elementary Education, acknowledged the enormity of the project and the district's dedication to its success, "One block at a time....We will have a 'whatever it takes' attitude.
The start-up grant will give UALR and its partners a year to prepare for the full-scale implementation of a program aimed at replicating the kind of private-public partnerships that made the Harlem Children’s Zone a model to provide children in the neighborhood “whatever it takes” to raise them up from babyhood to college..

Small things with Great features : Black Pepper

Small things with Great features : Black PepperPosted in by AICA Patrick
We get our black pepper from the pepper vine that can grow at least thirty feet tall in the stifling climates of the tropical parts of the world. The pepper vines actually bear fruit—small white flowers that turn into berries called peppercorns. Manufacturers take the peppercorns and collect them as whole berries or as ground black pepper.
Research studies have shown that black pepper actually has healthful properties such as:
· It is its ability to enhance the function of the digestive tract that makes it a good reason to put it in the dishes you cook.
· Diminish the amount of gas in the intestinal tract. This leads to less flatulence and bloating and is believed to be another benefit of increasing hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
· Has a great amount of antioxidant properties.
· Benefits against bacterial growth, particularly in the intestinal tract.
The good news is that all you need to do is put a little bit in your food every day.

The fashionable Tokyo thoroughfare of Omotesando invariably bustles with hordes of young people, but turn away from its rows of Zelkova trees and head down one of its back streets, and peace and quiet prevail.
This is where it all started for hairdresser Hideaki Iijima, 61.
He is the founder of Soho, the second-largest chain of hair salons in Brazil. Soho has 28 locations in Sao Paulo, and serves more than 700,000 customers annually.
On Jan. 10, during a brief trip to Japan, Iijima visited hair salon 'imaii,' where he learned his trade. It was the first time he had returned there in more than a decade. Despite dredging through his memories, he had a hard time remembering exactly where the place was. Suddenly, he came to a standstill in front of a leaning power pole, rubbing his hands as he spoke.
"This is it, right here. I was brought here several times a day to be scolded beside this power pole in front of the salon."
Imaii, which has a floor space of only six tsubo (just under 20 square meters), is now located in a fashionable building that stands diagonally across from the power pole. Its proprietor, Hideo Imai, trained at the Vidal Sassoon salon in the United States in the 1970s, and is responsible for popularizing the innovative "Sassoon cut" in Japan.
Before joining Imai's salon, Iijima had already worked at several other establishments and become a competent hair stylist, but was troubled by a lack of confidence in his skills. Then one day he saw a magazine article about Imai who had just returned to Japan, and wasted no time in asking him for a job.
"Mr. Imai was strict, but I acquired the kind of skills and theory that I could be satisfied with, and I gained confidence in my abilities," Iijima says.
Before he knew it, he had become a popular hair stylist.
There was no end to customers requesting Iijima's services, and in one month alone he cut the hair of 760 clients. His days off were spent traveling the country to give seminars for hairdressers, and magazines and industry shows eagerly sought his expertise. Eventually, his monthly wages topped 1 million yen ($12,000).
"He brought us more business not only with his hairdressing talent, but also his cheerful conversational skills," Imai recalls.
However, after about five years, Iijima called time out on his career as a "charismatic hairdresser." He accepted an invitation from one of his former trainees who was managing a hair salon in Brazil, and emigrated there with his wife, 4-year-old son, and infant daughter. He was 28.
"I had dreamed of moving overseas since I was little," he says. "If I had stayed where I was, I thought I'd most likely end up regretting it."
* * *
Adjusting to life in another country wasn't easy.
He found himself at odds with his former trainee, and was fired after two years. The 10 million yen he had saved in Japan soon ran out. He borrowed three mirrors, and decided to test his mettle by working at a local salon.
For him, it was like a battleground.
The most senior hairdresser took the position closest to the salon's entrance, and newcomer Iijima was given the spot farthest back. Even if a customer came in without an appointment, they rarely made it into Iijima's chair. Names of non-existent clients were written in his column on the salon's appointment board, as well as other tricks intended to prevent him from gaining actual business. It was the underhanded work of his colleagues.
"I live off my daily income. I wish I had the stability of a fixed salary, like office workers do," Iijima lamented to his neighbor, Kenichi Shiomi, who worked for the local subsidiary of The Bank of Tokyo (currently Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ).
Shiomi, now 64, remembers it so well because Iijima wasn't the type to feel sorry for himself. His oldest son, Dai, 37, agrees.
"At the time, my father didn't understand much Portuguese," Dai says. "I think he couldn't communicate well with his customers, which must have really bothered him."
One day, Iijima came up with a plan. The shampoo sink was at the rear of the salon, so every customer had to pass by him. He carved his name into an eraser and made a stamp, then used it to add his name to the salon's business cards that he handed out to customers. Each time he would make a pitch for himself in broken Portuguese, saying, "I'm Iijima from overseas."
In order to make himself stand out while cutting a client's hair, he deliberately exaggerated his movements, clicking his fingers and flattering customers by saying things like "Fantastic!" to put them in a good mood.
To make allies of the salon's assistants and coffee-making staff, he gave them money on the sly. This used up a third of his wages.
* * *
When Iijima began to consider striking out on his own, he remembered a certain prophecy: "Your life will change when you turn 32."
It had been told to him by a client who read his fortune soon after he came to Brazil. Believing it, he opened a hair salon in an office district on his 32nd birthday, which attracted a clientele of businessmen. He opened at 9 a.m., and stayed open for as long as he had customers. Some days he even worked until 1 a.m. Within seven months, he had paid back the $90,000 he had borrowed from his friends and was eventually able to expand to a chain of shops.
Two days before his 40th birthday, in September 1990, Iijima awoke to discover that he had lost his sight. He had no idea why, and even wondered if he was about to die. After much agonizing, he came to accept that his fate was still his own, even if his luck had abandoned him.
When he made the decision to retire from hairdressing and just manage his Soho shops, he regained his sight, but only in his right eye.
"Maybe it was because I'd taken a load off my mind," he says.
Three years later, thieves broke into his home. A gun was pressed against his temple and his neck was slit with a knife. He barely escaped death by handing over his money and valuables.
After this string of nightmarish incidents, Iijima came to regard his life beyond the age of 40 as a bonus.
At the time, Brazil was wracked by inflation and the price of living escalated rapidly. The government froze savings accounts, which caused cash flow problems. While several of his rivals gradually went out of business, Iijima raised his prices almost every week and just managed to stay afloat.
Training his 1,100 staff members also posed difficulties.
"Many Brazilians don't think ahead, so it was difficult for them to understand what I meant when I talked about having dreams," he says. "It was a near-impossible task to improve their skills on an ongoing basis."
But Iijima himself has an awkward side and maneged to turn his complex into a driving force. He is aware of how others feel when they fail to accomplish something. Gradually, people began to flock to him.
"If you stay true to yourself and have a purpose, it gives you the courage to confront adversity," he says. "I'll keep doing things the Iijima way until I die."
* * *
Hideaki Iijima
Born in 1950 in Saitama Prefecture. Graduated from Kodama High School in Saitama, and gained his hairdressing license in 1970. Worked for several salons in metropolitan Tokyo before joining Hideo Imai's studio in Harajuku. Received acclaim for his hair-cutting techniques, becoming a popular stylist. Described as one of the first "charismatic hairdressers." Emigrated to Sao Paulo in 1979. Opened salon Soho in Sao Paulo in 1982, and turned it into Brazil's second-largest hair salon chain.
Memo
Family: Iijima divorced six years ago, and is currently single. He lives with his eldest son, Dai, and his wife, to whom he handed over the management of his salon business five years ago. His eldest daughter, Ai, also lives in Sao Paulo. His two children were born when he was still living in Japan, but he had the intention of moving overseas one day, "so I gave them names that could be easily pronounced by non-Japanese."
Motivation: Iijima's father ran a barbershop in Saitama that his eldest brother eventually took over, so he became a hairdresser to avoid becoming a commercial rival. He always used his favorite Japanese-made Tenyo scissors, which he sharpened himself.
On weekdays from 4:30 a.m., for an hour and a half, Iijima helps clean a park near his home. He has never missed a day in the past 15 years.

Another Movie Guy?: "Funny People," "Burma VJ," misc.Posted: July 31st, 2009 | Filed under: Uncategorized | Comments Off
Welcome to”Another Movie Guy?”! This week I wondered whether I’d be able to find a connection between two new releases, Funny People and Burma VJ. One is a documentary about journalists who expose the truth about a military junta, whereas the other is a comedy about ill-behaved comedians. After Funny People, I left the theater in a beleaguered state, and it dawned on me that both movies are about forty minutes too long. Moreover, I wanted to like them more than I did. Unfortunately, the respective directors had too much faith in weak material.
Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to watch an open mic night. Several comedians performed, including one who embarrassingly bombed. At first the audience gave him the benefit of a doubt. Then he began a tedious bit about plastic surgery, and good will gave way to jeers and sarcastic laughter. The comedian’s only recourse was to discuss his insecurities and to insult the audience. Such a breakdown informed my thoughts on Funny People, Judd Apatow’s ambitious new comedy. It shrewdly examines a man who only knows how to be funny and mean, and what might happen if he’s forced to take stock of his life. The result is honest, yes, but not particularly rewarding. Short on laughs and long on running time, Apatow’s third directorial effort falters.
Adam Sandler stars as George Simmons, a sellout comedic actor who gains massive wealth with high-concept Hollywood garbage (not unlike Sandler himself). Leaving his mansion for the doctor’s office, George gets bad news: he has a rare blood disease, and the experimental treatment he’s given only has an eight percent success rate. Without friends, Simmons wanders to a comedy club, a place where he can be honest and people might listen. There he meets Ira (Seth Rogen), a struggling comedian who is jealous of his successful roommates (Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman). Much to Ira’s surprise, he’s asked by George to write some jokes for an upcoming corporate event. Ira agrees, and quickly becomes George’s confidant/whipping boy. Abusing the younger comedian is not rewarding enough, so George turns to Laura (Leslie Mann), his One Who Got Away. She still has feelings for George, and the two even consider a future together. Too bad Laura’s Australian husband (Eric Bana) is in the way.
Funny People is clearly more ambitious than Apatow’s prior movies, and here he overreaches. The problem is not with the actors. Rogen successfully plays a goofball who has trouble handling a serious situation. Sandler plays a character not unlike his roles from the mid-90s; like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Simmons can be obnoxious and cruel, with little empathy for others. Unlike Sandler’s goofy characters, George’s bad behavior has real consequences, and he’s a believable jackass. Some moments, particularly as Ira and George get to know one another, Sandler notably juxtaposes humor and buried pain. Still, the problem is that Funny People lacks the warm emotional core found in The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Apatow’s characters are realistic and their drama is authentic, yet that does not engender an overwrought climax.
The sequence in question is a long weekend at Laura’s home. Even if it gives Leslie Mann (Apatow’s wife) a chance to really act, the climax becomes tedious. Character choices are unclear, and too often these scenes announce emotion instead of showing it. The vulgar best friends, usually an Apatow highlight, are unfunny because they’re too selfish in such a dramatic universe (this is especially true during Ira’s romantic subplot, which never gains speed). Oh, and there are numerous cameos, from celebrities and up-and-comers alike, and their clever one-liners cannot save the exacerbating final scenes. Perhaps Apatow loves his movie too much to pare it down. Like the characters of Funny People, comedians are great company when they’re on point. When they’re not funny, their company can be almost unbearable, especially with a two and a half hour running time.
With Burma VJ, director Anders Østergaard tries to accomplish a noble thing with meager material. Late in the summer of 2007, Burma saw the beginnings of an uprising, one that eventually escalated to violence. After the 1988 riots left hundreds dead, the Burmese were too afraid to speak out. Everyone considers the monks a legitimate political force, so when they protest nearly 20 years later, ordinary citizens take to the streets. Østergaard documents the uprising with the help of undercover journalists (like the recent Tehran protests, borders were closed to foreign press). Using the pseudonym Joshua, a journalist serves as narrator, and is never shown on camera. He describes how he and his colleagues would risk their lives for newsworthy images. Secret police scatter throughout the city, and Joshua can never be sure when they will spot him. As the conflict escalates, Joshua flatly notes that more deaths are the only way to stir global conscience.
The principle weakness with Burma VJ is the quality of the smuggled footage. Joshua and others had to contend with military police and omnipresent fear, and it follows they could not always get the best shot. I realize the journalists were brave and did the best they could, yet they give Østergaard little to work with, and so his documentary lacks emotional power. At the height of the protests, for example, a journalist snags a shot of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (recent Gandhi prize winner), who has been living under house arrest. It should be a climactic, stirring moment, one that inspires others to act. Joshua says the image is blurry and the woman is at a distance, yet is moved to tears. Audience members lack Joshua’s immediate investment in the struggle, and will not have a similar reaction. That is not to say, however, that all the footage is uninspiring. Journalists catch moments when ordinary Burmese proclaim their desire for martyrdom, and there is suspense as a journalist hides from gunfire. Some especially stirring shots capture the scope of the protests. Østergaard and Joshua have moving stuff, just not enough for a feature-length documentary.
That’s it for this week’s “Another Movie Guy?”! Tune in next week when romantic comedy overload continues.

Movie Trivia Answers? This is Spinal Tap
Hosted by the awesome LG Keltner, we are to post about our writing beginnings.
Want to know how CassaStar began?
There were many influences. I was always a Star Trek fan. Star Wars came along and redefined movies and space operas. I enjoyed the likes of Bradbury and Heinlein.
And then, a single image for an upcoming TV series caught my attention:
Frank Frazetta’s artwork for the series Battlestar Galactica.
What ignited my imagination was the setting – a rocky planet and a downed ship. The characters, stranded and ready to defend themselves, also caught my attention. (And in the central character, you can probably see the beginnings of Byron.) I imagined two people, a pilot and a navigator, their fighter shot down on a rocky planet and forced to make a sacrifice.
That scene, written when I was a teen, was the only part of the original story to survive. (And the scene changed some during the rewrite.) But that image ignited the story behind CassaStar, which eventually became my first published book. Now it’s an Amazon Best Seller and has spawned two sequels.
A picture really is worth a thousand words!
Excited about the new books and blogfests? Are you picking up Adversarius? Get any of the movie trivia right? And how did your writing begin?
Don’t forget to visit M. Pax’s Spacedock 19!

You had some great influences there. Thanks for participating in my blogfest! And your new header is awesome!
I enjoyed learning about the motivation for CassaStar! Your new header looks great Alex! Jeremy did a terrific job. Congrats to the authors, and I'll have to check out some of these blogfests.
Julie
Wow, your new header caught my attention right away - it's awesome!
Nice to find out where it all started. The new header is very eye catching - well done Jeremy!
I missed the last Got Green? blog hop, so I'll be taking part this time. Should be a blast!
Thanks for the shout out!
Love the header!
And yes, Frazetta is the man.
Mmm... I started writing "poetry" (i.e. silly long rhymes) when I was seven or eight.
First novel started when a character walked into my head while I was reading. I was thirteen. :-D
It's amazing that one picture can inspire so much, and that in itself is inspiring. :)
Cool new header!
Lots of great blog fests and links today. Jeremy is so talented! I'll hit M. Pax soon. I'm not surprised to see Battlestar Galactica being a major influence for Casastar. :)
Great to hear the beginnings of Cassastar! I think pictures can be really inspiring, too...I've frequently wished I could draw instead of write. :)
I love the header!
I can see how that picture would inspire you. Neat beginning!
This is Spinal Tap is so awesome. Thanks for the heads up about the Overcoming Adversity blogfest.
Star Trek was the thing that inspired me to create stories as well :)
Love that echo of Battlestar G in your story - awesome!
LG, thanks for hosting!
Nick, you're welcome.
Ciara, you can probably see that really easily!
Hey there!
I love your new header. When it's time for a new look I think I'll contact Jeremy too! I'll treat myself when I hit a certain number of page views!
Your new header is AWESOME!!!!!!!! Really, really, really cool. It feels like a videogame in here now!
Congratulations to Mel and all the authors with new books. And Alex, nice to hear about your inspiration. I love hearing how books began.
Love the new header! And Frazetta has inspired a lot of folks, I think. You're in great company there.
Love the awesome header! Beautiful work, Jeremy.
Enjoyed your interview over at Spacedock 19 with Mary. Yes, please discuss cloning next. :)
Congrats on the new releases, Hilde, Becca, and Mel.
Frazetta is head and shoulders above everyone else when it comes to those sorts of paintings.
Like the new look!
I love that you've had the story all these years and finally acted on it to such success. Very inspiring for another late starter. Though only in my actual writing. My story premises are much more recent.
I should've known A Fish Called Wanda. I love that movie! And I love Frank Frazetta. He's one of the few artists I used to try to emulate.
I'm loving Frazetta's picture. It's mezmerizing. I think it's awesome, too, that you wrote a scene as a teen, with the picture as your inspiration for CS, Alex. Very cool.
Thanks as always for all the tasty bites of info. I'll be checking out the blogfests.
xoRobyn
As always-- great information. The new header looks fantastic.
I also liked Galactica. Never missed it. I think it was movies who inspired me to start writing too. Movies and way too much time alone.
Jolie, he does a great job.
Cathy, like a videogame - funny!
Laura, cloning is on the list.
Donna, it's never too late.
Robyn, that scene was just so powerful.
Great Battlestar Galactica picture! This series is one of my favourites.
Interesting to know how Cassastar came about. Great post.
Yvonne.,
I absolutely LOVE your new header. Wow. Cool. And the fact that that teaser picture for Battlestar Galactica was the impetus for CassaStar is fascinating. So amazing how inspiration strikes. And I am dying to read How I Fell for the Funny Fat Girl. So many books, so little time...
Whoa! That header is totally awesome!
Love to hear how CassaStar came into being.
Oh, hey, did you know that Indie Life thing I did today was inspired by you? Not my thing in it, but the people that put that together were inspired by you.
Love the new header, Alex! I'm heading over to Spacedock 19 now. :)
Wow! lots of news!
I enjoyed reading about the beginnings of your first book. Thanks for sharing. :)
How cool that an image got you started! It's one of my favorites, too. Sadly, I missed the signup for this blogfest, but I have other surprises in store for today. :)
Flashy new header!
And interesting to find out your novels were inspired by that artwork.
Definitely like the new banner for your blog and also some great info and links. Going to check them out!
Now I REALLY want to read Adversarius. I shall have to keep my eyes out for this one.
Thank you for sharing the story behind part of CassaStar, I love hearing back stories behind books!
Zoltan, it was a favorite of mine.
She'll, just one image started it all...
Andrew, I did!
David, sorry you missed it.
Love the header! Inspiration is everywhere if we are just alert and open to it.
That is a really cool image - I can see why it inspired your writing!
Frank Frazetta is an amazing artist. I'm going to his Website now and spend some time just looking at his images.
And good luck to all the writers and their new releases! 2013 is going to be a great year!
Love the pic and the story behind CassaStar! Pictures are inspiring. I'm saving the date for your fest and Mark's.
And my writing started with the story of a dancing hat . . .and then another about a pencil that escaped from school. (elementary school stories influenced by my love of tap dancing movies, and my strong dislike of school)
Congrats to ML!
Header is awesome :) And that picture is awesome; definitely inspirational... hehee, so punny. Congrats on all the books!
A picture is worth a thousand words indeed. Will read your guest post and thanks for keeping us informed.
I love the new header! Thanks for the news. I'm totally gonna check out Nick's blogfest, and I can't wait to read REASONS.
Al, I do like your new header. Jeremy was done a very, very appropriate job. It evokes a very CassaNinja feel.
I am curious about your blogfest, and Mary Pax, Nicki Elson and I will be announcing one for March 1 this Friday, too.
As for the beginnings of CassaStar, I love that a picture was literally worth a thousand words. And I was also interested to know that the first scene was written in your adolescence! I like that detail very much, the idea of an entire world pulsing with promise since then.
That BSG picture is fantastic.
Love the new header. Signed up for Nick's blogfest. I can see Byron in that picture! I'm getting reallly frustrated. Choosing to read "CassaStar" to my kids was a wrong move. I read to them at bedtime, and at best get a chapter in before they zonk. Sometimes I sneak and read ahead...but don't tell them!
As an old school BSG fan, I'm amazed that I've never seen that picture before....very cool!
I always find it very interesting how just one spark can ignite something bigger.
Better writing through chemistry :)
Nice header, Jeremy!
I'm keeping away from blogfests until April--at least that's my plan. My last couple of weeks with illness and holidays have already set me a year behind in blogging. Please don't come up with any blogfests I can't refuse!
Lee
Tossing It Out
I do love your new header! It amazes me how much things happen every week. I feel so left behind.
So awesome to hear the story behind that! I've always wondered. Can't wait for your blogfest announcement :)
You new header rocks. Love the flash, Alex. Fits with your uniqueness!
Great looking header. It's good to hear how it all began for you too.
What a fun new header!
Great new header! and thanks for all the updates. Best :)
Lots of stuff going on. Always good to come over here to catch up, and find out yet another interesting fact.
Although I'm an avid Bradbury reader (and a couple of Heinlein), and loved BG, I write totally different stuff. Thank goodness for authors like you who feed my addiction to that genre.
Love the new header! Great job, Jeremy. That is cool that BSG inspired you, and that you wrote the first scene as a teen!
Yes I like your new header! Jeremy is really good at creating headers that capture the tone of the blog.
SO techi... so interesting, such fun! Both you and your header.
The cool factor on that banner is very high! One of my buddies approach to painting mini's is inspired by Frazetta.
Nice new banner! I love the golden-brown color scheme.
I've been writing since I was 4 years old, literally as long as I could write. It's just what I've always done, no special inspiration to have started.
I love the new header, Alex! I've been to Spacedock 19 - I'm on my way:)
Cool new header and interesting how one picture can spark an entire series!
Stephen, you could get lost at that site...
Tyrean, a dancing hat! That is definitely original.
Suze, excited to hear about your blogfest! Yes, there was a really crappy first draft of CassaStar written in my teen years, all stemming from that one scene.
Mark, I think the black and white version was in the old TV Guide magazine.
Lee, you might not be able to refuse mine...
Clarissa, it amazes me as well.
Joylene, thank you!
ML, I'm trying.
Carrie-Anne, that's a long time...
Off to visit M-Pax!
Liked to BG artwork :). Hadn't seen it before. Great seeing your inspiration for the start of the Cassa series.
Cool backstory on your book, Alex! And congrats to all the writers in today's post - there's a lot of exciting news swirling about the blogosphere.
Well, it was ST:TNG for me when I was in middle school, though I'd watched the original series and the original Battlestar Galactica in reruns with my dad. I also used to page through my dad's Frank Frazetta art book (though I think there was stuff in there young kids weren't supposed to see).
Very cool that your scene survived all those years (and revisions), Alex.
ML's cover looks awesome!
It was fun and enlightening to talk to you Alex. Glad you visited the Spacedock. Your clones are welcome any time.
Love the new header! And Congrats to ML!
That picture is very inspiring. I loved BSG - the original and the remake.
I thought something looked different over here ;) Thanks for the mention, too! You rock!
And I think the only images that have inspired me are ones of hot guys without their shirts on. That counts, right? :)
Congratulations!
Your new header is an inspiring eye-catcher.
A picture really is worth a thousand words!
I work together with people from different countries and I can't count how often we use pictures.
M Pepper, I bet there was a lot you shouldn't have seen! Oh well.
Emily, the only one that did.
Mary, thanks for having me.
Becca, you are welcome!
Thanks for the information; you are like the Blogger Times:D
I got my Writer's Creed badge, and am off to visit the Beginnings Blogfest, M. Pax, and all the other goodies you have lined up for us.
ooh! Fancy new header is fancy! Blinking lights and everything!
Love the new header.
I started writing back in the dark ages to amuse my friends. It was supposed to be a novel but everyone wanted to be a character, and everyone wanted their character to do this and that, so it ended up being a sprawling continuing story that was still going when my dad got transferred during my senior year (oh, the agony of it all) and we had to move.
Yes, exquisite headboard, love the dynamic light shows.
I love what Jeremy did for your blog header. Very cool--much like Jeremy himself.
I like the sound of Adversarius and the hero's code of honor. I'll be checking that out for sure!
Hope your week is going well, Alex!
Blessings, my friend.
The header is really neat!
I loved the old Battlestar. And had such a crush on Richard Hatch.
Alex,
I did like how the header came out as I described it as... Space battle in the Matrix... thank you for letting me be creative.
So many things going on today, I enjoyed the Battlestar... I as a kid had a cardboard Viper, that I sent in for from the back of cereal box... oh the memories.
Great Day!
Jeremy
The new header is awesome! I'm already signed up for Nick's blogfest, but I'll have to pass on Mark's for a very good reason. I'll be here! :D
Congratulations to Hildie, Becca Ann, and M.L.! I'm off to visit M. Pax now. :)
So interesting hearing your inspiration!
Finally some trivia I knew (well 2 questions anyway).
Not a big sci/fi fan, but I loved Battlestar Galacticia (the original TV)
I do like the new header! Thanks for all the news and notes. Appreciate you keeping us in the loop. I know I'd totally be out of that loop otherwise! :)
I love the header! I see animated pirate ships in my future. :D Thanks for the shout out, Alex!
And my writing started after I created Kayta for a D&D game. Geek to the core! XD
My first writing experience was when I was 8, but my real writing experience was probably when I joined my current writing group 10 years ago. Everything I write comes out twisty and dark no matter how I try the opposite. Horror it is! LOL.
Frank Frazetta’s artwork is amazing. I used to paw all over it when I was young. I get a lot of my writing inspiration from art as well.
There is so much to do and see that I'm not sure what I'm doing next! Love the new header Alex. A million thanks for my book shout out. Have a beautiful day!
Edi, hoping you'll enjoy those last thousand words.
Sarah, I know - it rocks!
LD, you should dig it up.
Sia, he IS cool.
Jeremy, that's funny. And the header rocks.
Carrie, yes, you will be my guest that day!
Mel, you're welcome. And you need to have him do that. Spruce up your header while keeping the ships and the feel.
Lynda, I pawed over it as well, but I'm sure for a different reason.
Hildie, you're welcome!
Thanks for the secret origin of the Cassan universe!
Dunno how you keep up Alex. Liked the sound of Adverstarius so bought it for my Kindle.
Love your new header. Very flash.
No good at movie trivia. Don't get to see too many movies.
Interesting how Cassa Star began.
Love that picture. I never missed an episode of the original Battlestar Galactica.
I believe I have some of his artwork on collector's cards. Fascinating artwork that really drew my eye. I found them in a little shop in a tiny town near the coast of Oregon (while looking for X-Files cards, haha). I do love inspiration in all forms. Wonderful to hear where CassaStar came from.
Shannon at The Warrior Muse
Love the new header. Very cool. And I think it's amazing how your whole life was essentially changed by that picture. Think about it. The blog. All these people. How much would be the same if you'd never seen that and never decided to write Cassa Star? Maybe it all would've happened in some other way, but you never know.
I think that's the best thing about life. How even the most innocuous-seeming things (like a picture) can impact you for years to come. :)
Too much going on! AH!
It's all good though.
Nice getting a glimpse into 'the beginning'.
Thanks for sharing.
Heather
Jo, I just do my best.
Susan, I didn't either!
Shannon, that is very cool! I have a game with his artwork on it.
Tamara, none of it would've happened...
Very cool beginning. A picture or a piece of music an inspire a whole series. I'm off to the Spacedock now!
Alex, I think you are at the point now that you need this comment box at the top of the comment list instead of the bottom :) That is a very cool header and I like it a lot. I will throw some work Jeremy's way if I decide to go that route at some point.
Hey I got three of the four movies I named, right!! Amazing.
Lots going on this first week or so in 2013!
Nothing like starting with a BANG!!!!!!
I got one from the trivia! Yeah! Can't wait to stop by M.Pax's blog to check out the post. :)
Cool banner!
~Stephanie
Chuck, I'll see what I can do about the comment box, And I think one of Jeremy's headers would look awesome on your blog.
Stephanie, glad you got one right.
It was nice to read about your motivation for Cassa Star!
I'll go check out your interview with Pax.
Some really great blog hops coming up and I'm so stoked for Becca's book! :)
I love your header!!! Jeremy rocks, flashes and glows ;D
What the heck...a month? C'mon Captain...no fair-I need a hint!
Off to check out MPax-I miss her~
I'm so behind, but playing catch up is fun!
I love how fun and kind your blog is!
Congrats to all! Mel you rock ;D
Yeah, that image would catch my attention too.
......dhole
Franzetta's Battlestar Galactica is epic. Great inspiration Alex.
Love the new banner. I wondered if Retro Zombie was the creator.
Hard to beat Frazetta, and yes, I can see Byron in that center figure.
I love how the Cassa trilogy, and by extension this blog, came about because of that single image. It's a pretty awesome way to begin :)
Jamie
I'm not surprised that a powerful image you saw as kid helped to inspire your novel. The older I get, the more I'm amazed at how much the world we lived in when young still affect us.
One of these days, I swear I'm gonna answer all your trivia questions.
Hey, it's cool to know how you got started with CassaStar. I didn't realize you began writing it when you were a teen :)
Oh I read and reviewed Adversarius! It's a great book. Congratulations to Mel Chesley :))
Great header! It was interesting reading about what inspired CassaStar.
Dude. Your new banner looks awesome!
Ella, thank you. And I will give you a hint - it involves a top ten list.
DG, figured you would see Byron.
Jamie, it is wild when you think about it.
Helena, don't give up hope that you'll answer them.
Rachel, I did! Many, many years ago...
Michael, you're a speed reader.
Man I love those moments where inspiration strikes is right on down! :) Nice story for the blogfest. I have yet to read any of your books but they are all high up on my TBR!
and thousands of fans!
awesome picture! art is so inspirational!
fabulous new look! love it!
cant wait to see what you do next!
Great new banner! Loved Frazetta's artwork and all the newsy stuff!
Love the new header, noticed it right away :). A new blogfest? Hmmm...I am most intrigued!
Happy Wednesday!
Jen
Awesome banner!!! And so many blogfests to enter. Congratulations to all that have new books out.
I love the story behind the inspiration for CassaStar. That image can really stir some creativity, and I'm glad it caught your eye. I have a funny story about my inspiration for Forged by Greed :-)
I'm off to M Pax's blog to read the post.
I love the new banner! It's spectacular!
The new banner is AWESOME, Alex!!! Love it. =) Going to check out books. =)
Your new header is great!
So what should I do now, shut my blog down or change header?
I totally identify with using artwork for inspiration! I'm working on a high fantasy project, and I've developed a habit of finding scifi and fantasy pictures on pinterest to help me envision locals and characters and even events for my story. :D
Trisha, thank you!!
Tara, I hope I have that many fans.
Angela, you need to post that story.
Jay, or contact Jeremy to do a new one!
Liesel, smart idea.
Oy! Totally forgot it was Wednesday yesterday. Better late than never. Good thing I dropped by. I'd miss all the news without your posts. So many blogfest! And so little time. I loved the BG from the late 70's early 80's. had big crushes in Apollo & Starbuck. Not surprised you'd find it inspiring. Funny where we find that nugget of inspiration.
That's so cool to learn the inspiration behind Cassa Star! I remember when that picture came out! :)
It's amazing what can come from a simple picture. I know I've had my fair share of image-based muses. Love the new header. Absolutely gorge!!!
Alex, the new header is jazzy. I like it.
It boggles my mind when I come here and see all these blog posts I want to visit and all these new books I want to read. I need more hours in my day.
Yes, interesting CassaStar roots.
I love the new header! Awesome lightning effects... very atmospheric!
I enjoyed the Cassastar beginnings...
It seems like the blogfests never end... there are so many new ones...
Nancy, it was a cheesy show, but I dug it.
DL, glad someone else remembered!
Patricia, I am here to boggle...
I love the new header!! Great job, Jeremy!
Alex, lucky you, yes it's me, Penny the Jack Russell dog and modest internet superstar!
You are having another blogfest? We will check that out. We do so hope you join our "Groundblog Day" blogfest. That's "Groundblog", not "Groundhog". Clever, eh?
You are having another blogfest? We will check that out. We do so hope you join our "Groundblog Day" blogfest. That's "Groundblog", not "Groundhog". Clever, eh?
Went by Nick's blog. I'm in. Working on a story tonight. You've got a hear of gold, Alex.
And thanks for the spam info. Followed all. So far, so good. :)))
I'm a very visually-oriented gal, so I can see how this image would've jump started your creativity!
It's truly amazing what can spark a story idea!
As always I can count on you to keep me busy...LOL, Not that I need it, But nice to know what needs checing out :)
Gary, I won't have to listen to I Got You Babe, will I? Gary, I won't have to listen to I Got You Babe, will I?
Thanks, Kittie! And glad that nixed the spam.
Gotta learn outlining...heading over there now. And it turns out that by sheer luck that I DID know the first trivia answer (it just popped into my brain) even though it's been YEARS since I slept through the movie...
Tina @ Life is Good
Thanks for providing these links and all this info. Lots to go through. I especially love the rebel writer's creed.
YES, I love the header! It's perfect for this blog!
I also loved Sheri's writer's creed. It's full of great reminders.
Thanks for sharing all the great news. It's so exiting.
That's a cool story of how you came up with your novel concept!
GOT GREEN!!!!! You know, I'm the reigning champion for that blogfest, I've got to really step it up this year if I'm to win again...
And LOVING the new look...
I'm commenting just ahead of a new post. LOL I'm so far behind, I can't even see what's behind be me anymore.
LOVE the new banner. Jeremy is major-league talented.
Frank Frazetta is one of my all time favorite artists. His Wolfman is on my wall here at home.
What wonderful news all around the blogosphere. I love hearing all this great news.
I love Star Trek too and Star Wars! Though some of my guy friends make fun of me for it since they are "guy movies/shows" but I'm a geek. :)
I'm excited for all of the new blogfests!
That header is FANTASTIC!! I love it!
Thanks for the links and news. I love the new header.
Tina, good for you!
Morgan, the pressure is on.
Melissa, Jeremy did an awesome job.
Krista, no, you are an uber-cool chick in my book!
Hi Alex - so pleased you highlighted Nick's blogfest for his son - raising funds via an anthology - it will be great.
I have to catch up - so much happening - how does anyone keep up ..
Cheers and I love the header - talented bloggers around .. let alone writers! Have a great year - Hilary
I was wondering where you got that great new header! It's awesome!
Jai
Aloha,
I'm about as late as late can be, but wanted to say Cheers for the O'shout out and may your eyes not glaze over if I add to the "Wow, dude, cool new header" gang :)

My name’s Alex, and I’m getting started with Game Design; specifically, I’m carving a niche as a technical game designer.
About Me
I’m a geek of all trades, and a master of some. I obviously love playing video games, but I also enjoy traditional games, comics, anime, science, and anything in the sci-fi or fantasy genres.
I’ve played my fair share of Magic. I’ve DMed a few campaigns of D&D.
My Story
I grew up playing Skate or Die on my brother’s Commodore 64 and Pitfall on his Atari. His hand-me-downs were an electronic legacy that got me thinking of games as early as four years old. The first time I even considered that I might be able to have a computer of my own, the first thought that entered my mind was that I would be able to make video games. My 10-year-old brain didn’t have the slightest clue what that would require, but the seed was planted.
Later on in my early teens, I got into playing Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II on the MSN Gaming Zone. I quickly got wrapped up in the world of “cogs,” hacking game files to bend the game to your will. There was the additional challenge of keeping the hack from tripping a checksum error, so you could take your hacks into multiplayer games.
In high school, I was a member of the school website team starting in my freshman year. That’s where my interest in web development grew. I pursued that interest in college, and enjoyed it for the most part. However, my passion for creation and game design wouldn’t go without a fight. I made great plans for using my programming skills with my friends help to make games. Those plans never came to fruition.
A few years later, I decided I needed a game development booster shot. I went back to school for a dose of knowledge and networking, and now I’m ready to make waves in the industry.
<|endofexample|>
OberonViking I agree completely with you here. I actually have the trouble of needing to retrain my players as they began by mistrusting me. Probably because they are students at the school I teach at, perhaps becausew they are only 13 and 14, maybe because they have come with a background in computer RPGs and mmorgs.
– OberonViking 2012-07-06 10:10 UTC
shortymonster sadly, because I play with a mixed group from various other gaming groups, this kind of untrustworthiness seems to have been firmly established long before I got there. using an NPC as the guy who wired them’s second in command who was supposed to be very helpful indeed, even going behind his boss’s back on occasion for reasons of his own that were all in the player’s interests, and they still thought he was lying or withholding information.
– shortymonster 2012-07-06 10:18 UTC
lior An interesting point. On the one hand, we are trying to make the game world dangerous and full of evil. But then we avoid almost all things which are truly evil. We slaughter lots of creatures without problem and are happy when countless villagers are massacred because that is the next adventure hook. But torture, abuse, despair, we do not want to have those in the game. Why should we? If its ugly in the real world, how could it be fun in play?
There is something delusional about our hobby.
– lior 2012-07-06 11:30 UTC
-C It’s weird, I do this all the time and the players never really have a problem trusting anyone. I’ve never had a player do any of the things. Threaten to torture somebody? Never. Sometimes they’ll say “I don’t want to get screwed!” and I’ll say, “Well, you probably won’t” and that’s pretty much the end of it.
– -C 2012-07-06 12:28 UTC
@Lior: I think there is nothing delusional about it at all. It only seems delusional if you make broad simplifications. Let me dig a bit deeper:
Or:
Or:
We might get into real world ethics, of course (the ends justifying the means, is there a just war, human(oid) rights, war conventions) – but I think the key is how people feel at the table even if they cannot express it clearly.
There’s a line to be drawn everywhere with respect to “how much we can take”. Just as we do not experience risk in mathematical terms, we don’t experience cruelty and pain in statistically relevant terms. It matters whether we’re doing it, or it is being done to us, or we hear about other people doing it, the amount of graphic detail is important, our own sensibilities play an important role (people who enjoy watching Saw movies and I are not in the same boat).
– AlexSchroeder 2012-07-06 12:31 UTC
Alex takes a couple shortcuts to get to game content he enjoys and is interested in. That is not delusional.
It’s a question of where you draw the line in descriptions and where you lift the veil about NPCs. “His eyes dart around nervously as he tells you this” or “you have the uncanny feeling he is not telling the truth” is not the same thing as everybody always being nice, even if they’re supposed to be the bad guys.
Example: In Alex’ Wilderlands campaign there is a red dragon who got seven virgins every year; the reasons long forgotten by the humans. Yes, the dragon is going to sacrifice these innocent people in a ritual (and that is all I as a player needed to know) … but the ambiguity of real life starts beyond this; the dragon does this to seal a demon kings’ soul so he doesn’t resurrect himself in this part of the material plane.
And the goal of that subset of the campaign, chosen by the players, was to ensure the dragon doesn’t need to do that anymore. So:
– Harald 2012-07-06 12:42 UTC
@-C: If your players never suggested torture, more power to them! What about the other issues, however: When your players release prisoners, the freed prisoners go and fetch friends to chase after the player characters? If so, do the player characters continue to release prisoners? When your non-player characters lie to your player characters, will the players still trust other non-player characters? Perhaps your player characters never trust any non-player characters? Or perhaps sifting through the statements the non-player characters make is part of the game? It also seems to be what you’re saying in On Ignorance of Skill Based Play:
This would be similar to me openly admitting that the non-player character seems to be lying once they player ask me “is he lying?” or “I watch his face and try to figure out whether he’s lying.” In response, I’ll provide something pretty obvious like the examples Harald provided above: “His eyes dart around nervously as he tells you this” or “you have the uncanny feeling he is not telling the truth.”

lior @Alex, @Harald: Let me rephrase. We want dragons sacrificing virgins, but we do not want to think about what that would mean and how and why that is horrible. We want a road flanked by dozens of crucified criminals. But we do not want to imagine what that really means. Crucifixion → bad, human sacrifice → bad. Those are trivial conclusions. We want them in the game, but we want them to stay trivial.
Also, I did not say Alex is delusional, far be it from me. In fact I think Alex’ method is a mature way of not dealing with unfun issues.
I am deliberately saying “There is something delusional about our hobby” because I think it applies to almost all of us, myself very much included. I suspect those players who are OK with torture are so because it does not touch them emotionally as easily. In other words, it stays trivial for longer.

AlexSchroeder @Lior: I suspect that this is an aspect of all sane humans and is true for almost all endeavors: too much detail makes you crazy; too much terrible detail makes you crazy. It protects you from the tedium and horror of everything, of the entirety of our human existence. The repression of horrible details and (sometimes) their sublimation into action (or adventure in the case of role-playing games) seems to be one of the most basic mechanisms allowing us to function. But then again, I’m not a psychologist and have my reservations regarding Freud.

Brendan Question: how are lying NPCs different from trapped dungeon rooms? Is it a question of context? If so, maybe NPCs encountered in a dungeon are unreliable, while those encountered in a town are trustworthy? That seems like it might be a reasonable assumption, much like how players usually don’t feel the need to probe the floor in a tavern with a 10 foot pole.
– Brendan 2012-07-06 22:43 UTC
AlexSchroeder @Brendan: I think looking at the difference between traps and lying non-player characters is a good way of considering the issue. Context is a good point. I’d say that a non-player character joining the party and moving from the tavern context to the dungeon context warrants a bit more thought: Is the non-player character now a liability or does he “stay trustworthy?” My players might be expecting the character to stay honest and I tend to agree.
Another aspect I like is how traps or liars are discovered.
Here’s how I think traps ought to be used: there must be ways of discovering traps that doesn’t involve rolling dice. I like to say: “If you need to roll dice, it’s already too late.” Thus, examining the floor might yield “a line across the floor” or “a dried puddle of blood” or something along these lines. I like -C’s traps on his Hack & Slash blog because he discusses this discoverability of traps.
What about lying non-player characters? I feel that they need the same kind of discoverability. In the original example on G+ the Philip Watson had the evil cleric drink booze instead of joining combat in the first round and similar hints out there, so as far as I’m concerned, that’s good enough.

Bert Schramm
2823 Private Herbert Leslie SCHRAMM, a 22 year old Farmer from Whites River, South Australia. He enlisted on 17 February 1916; and at the conclusion of the war Returned to Australia, 10 July 1919.
During part of the course of his military service with the AIF, Bert Schramm took many photographs of scenes he encountered during his service in Palestine and Syria. Bert was not a man of letters so these photographs gave a vivid description of his daily life. Bert made a promise to his sweetheart, Lucy Solley, that he would do so after he received camera from which these photographs were made. As a Brigade Scout since September 1918, he took a lead part in the September Offensive by the Allied forces in Palestine. Coupled with Bert's diary entries which are placed alongside those of the 9th Light Horse Regiment to which he belonged and to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to which the 9th LHR was attached. On this basis we can follow Bert in the context of his formation and his photographs.
The photographs are placed and titled in in the same order and manner as they appear in the album. Where possible, commentary and links are given to provide additional information.
For a comprehensive listing of photographs in the album, see:

Charming, sun-soaked and obsessed with death. Tokyo's all-girl power trio Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re is irony personified.
It's a hard-rock band with punk sensibilities, danceable beats and a sharp-toothed metal roar. (How that roar comes from the vocal cords of three petite women is beyond me.) Singer Mari's warm delivery masks the often racier themes of tragedy and sex. To non-Japanese speakers oblivious to the meaning of the lyrics, some of the contrast is lost. But then there are the violent fits thrown by the feisty guitar and thumping drums, which help drive home the band's contradictory aesthetics.
"And the speed of the cars is fast. Everything is fast!"
The songs aren't always so heady or obscene. Sometimes they're just about food. In "Fish Cakes," each member plays a different ingredient in a hot pot, and in "No-Miso Shortcake" Mari invites us to eat her brain (all in Japanese, of course).
Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re introduced itself to America in 2004, when it toured alongside several other Japanese acts. A year later, the band reached the ears of thousands of Yanks as the opening act for the Suicide Girls Live Burlesque Tour. In a collectively answered e-mail interview, Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re's love for America is explicit. The fact that its current tour is the band's seventh in the States is also a testament to its adoration for the red, white and blue. "You can be unrestrictive about your feelings in the United States," the group says. "And the speed of the cars is fast. Everything is fast!"
The band's travels have been mostly glee-filled, but on one occasion, Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re found itself in a haunted hotel room. "We stayed at one place where a ghost seemed to be in the bathroom," the three band members say. "Everyone was afraid to go into the shower alone."
Then there was the dive bar. "There was no door in the restroom stall."
Just as Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re has come to lust for American life, so too have Americans come to adore the band. "The fans in the United States dance in a frenzy, even if they don't know us," Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re says. "In Japan the crowd is shy. Even if they love us, they won't dance alone."
So who's coming out to Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re shows? It's a colorful, brainy bunch. "A young person and an elderly person can both love Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re," the band says. "A lot of clever persons are in the fan base, too. For instance, scientists and college professors."
You don't need an advanced degree to see Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re in Albuquerque; you just have to be 21 or older. The band plays Burt's Tiki Lounge on Tuesday, Sept. 9. Static Static (L.A.) and Calico (here) are also on the bill. Entry is free as a bird.

I have been lucky enough to stay in Spokane for several days and my friend Cat calls it my "Northwest Basecamp." Max and I really enjoyed the company of Cat and her friends. During my stay, I was able to participate in many activities including going to the lake, concerts at the gas station, walking in the park, going on a merry-go-round, a trip to Idaho, eating a shrimp boil, herding cows at a working ranch, and many more fun things that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to participate in if I didn't make the trip.
As with all good bye's, this was a sad one but I know I will be back. Now it's time for Max and I to get on the road and head East. I will talk about our adventure in the next few days of blogs. Thank you for reading and for being a part of it with us! Also, a big thank you to the WSU design team and Danna Snow for allowing me to come in and photograph you!

No sugar beets today!
Instead I go outside to take my kid to school this morning and this is what we find. Ironically we had to drive 300 miles the day before for a family issue so it was 'good luck' that it didnt happen then.
So there is no happy challah bread, half eaten.
No happy easy eggs with avocado.
No happy easy eggs with avocado and red chile.
Only my car, and a tree knocked over by the 'weather' - fortunately it was the driver door mirror that was damaged, well that and my now deep seated psychological problems stemming from trees, weather, cars, and strange neighbors 'washing' it. (I dont know this guy)
I fell behind on comment response since we were 300 miles away (well we were really only 160 miles away it was 320 round trip, I like to exaggerate to make my anguish more anguishy) and I did not take my laptop.
34 comments:
You are lucky that the damage was so minimal.
And I love the kindness of fellow New Yorkers giving you a free car wash!
What are the chances!
Stace
stace: incredibly lucky (I guess) and yeah pretty funny - I didnt tell him it was my car I just snapped a few pictures and let him do what he wanted to do...
Good thing it wasn't major damage, just before Christmas!I guess you have other things to use time and money on! Do you keep your camera in your pocket?
anette: I do, I take my camera everywhere I go!
New Yorkers are an interesting group of people...good thing he was using a water hose!
I was on jds223's page with the hose!Gee who woulda thought that it was a tree you had to watch out for in the wilds of NYC?
hey, my car needs washing:)
the eggs n chile n avacado look wonderful..
jds223: that IS a good thing!
starrlife: yup, trees and mold and blinding fashion!
snugs: bring it on over to my block, I am sure this guy will oblige...and those eggs and avocado and chile were damn good.
Yep, lucky!!! I absolutely pissed myself laughing when I read that you dont know the guy with the hose!!! WHAT THE?????????
Maybe hes blind and he used to water the tree so now hes watering your car>>>>>> ha ha ha ha
Well that car got busted deep! Is nature taking it's revenge? Or is nature trying to get your attention?
Sorry about your ride dude. At least is wasn't a '57 Impala with chrome hubcaps and a chainlink steering wheel.
mandi: I wanted to give him a bucket of soap....
sofia: busted barely, actually, but nature is always the champion.
Loose one sideview mirror and find another.
francesco: how do you know I dont have a chrome chain link steering wheel?
andres: if only life could be so simple...
New Yorkers are NUTS!!! and I'm so glad that you weren't IN the car when this happened and it was only the mirror. I mean, who actually uses that particular mirror anyway, right?
I wondered where you were....I hope everything is ok with your family. No drama, ya know? Drama sucks.
xoxox
no it was just sitting on the street like normal....and yeah we had drama...
New Yorkers are NOT nuts - the rest of you goombas are nuts!
Now you got firewood for those roof top bar-b-que's.
Stuff like that drives me nuts! Just enough damage to inconvenience you during the holidays...
micky-t- ok mister half full - thats a bright side except the wood is still green and it is a city tree -but I do like the positive twist.
buff: EXACTLY!
Eww, what DOES a city tree smell like when it burns. LOL
Let it air dry on the roof for 3 months...it'll be good to go!
Oh man--sorry about your car! Bad tree!
Those eggs with chile and avocado look SLAMMING!
Who cut up the tree? Was it this same stranger who is washing your car? I didn't think there were nice people like that anymore? Must be the holidays.
One night in 1986, my husband and I parked our 1 year old Cadillacs side by side, mine backed in beside his, so he could get out his driver's door and open mine for me. There was a rainstorm that night; the next morning, the tree behind our cars had come down and crunched in the driver's sides of both cars. Homeowner's insurance paid for them, but it took a while. Relatively speaking, you were lucky. And you can send that neighbor to wash my cars in December, if you want!
I have a chiminea ready for the wood...and I will make you one of my 'Happy' Egg Nog drinks and we will have a good laugh about what life throws at us! Glad you and your son are ok...
Hope your weekend goes a little better! Glad the damage was only to the car.
sheesh I hate it when that happens...man that bread looks good!!!
You poor thing! You sounds like you're having a rough time!
Why was that guy washing your car? Weird! My husband would have freaked.
ouch! You're lucky the damage wasn't worse!
Do we get an example of your deep seated psychological problems? An altar boy stories you can share?
Okay, so you are the THIRD person I read that had damange done to their car, but at least you weren't driving it at the time like the other two were!
And some random person was washing your car? Strange, but kinda nice too, huh?
First off..the picture of your egg platter...priceless. You kill me with the colors.
Secondly...I am totally loving that you took a picture of the guy washing your car without letting him know that you were the owner...awesome!
OMG - I'm so happy the damage wasn't worse than what it was!
Well, at least he wasn't peeing on your car. And who needs a driver's side mirror anyway! :-)
"strange neighbors 'washing' it. (I dont know this guy)"
you still crack me up. Happy Holidays.

Carlton Books Ltd., Hard cover, ￡12.99, 384 pp. For your money, you received not only a book that looked good, but also one that actually told you something. When it comes to coffee table books, the two can never be taken for granted.
Fourteen years on, the book is enjoying a renaissance. It was last updated in 2000 and has now been pored over again, the cobwebs blown away, and the facts and figures updated for a new era. But what you don’t get anymore are the pictures, which is a shame as this is a book crying out for illustration. Don’t get me wrong, Roger’s words are as clear and crisp as ever, drawing on his four decades of banging on brewery doors and seeking out beers of quality, but the book, in its new, compact, monochrome format, has a rather dry feel to it.
The contents begin with the art and science of beer making, and the basics of brewing are explained extremely well, with more detail than is often found in catchall beer books. Then Roger describes his travels; zipping around the world, country-by-country, summing up the local beer scene, selecting the best exponents. Chapter Three takes us on a pub and bar tour of the world, with paragraphs on all of the best places to drink, before Chapter Four explores what it describes as “the culture of beer drinking”―anything from the origins of pub names to the latest licensing rules in the UK. Throughout, it’s clear that Roger knows his stuff; much of it gleaned firsthand through visits to the breweries and bars themselves.
Producing a revised edition of a book this extensive and detailed is always going to be fraught with danger―danger that an odd fact may be overlooked, danger that new information is sidelined in favor of just updating the existing text. Being picky, I did find examples where the story is not quite up-to-date and also stumbled across some notable omissions. I also noted that the absence of web details makes the book seem somewhat dated. That all said, it’s a good, solid, informative work―nearly 400 packed pages of text from the world’s leading beer writer―that I will certainly consult on a regular basis.
The lack of gloss and glamour in this new version can, of course, be a bonus. Think of the World Beer Guide as a solid primer―a fundamental, almost school textbook-like introduction to the world of beer, bars and brewing that cuts to the chase and leaves the frills for other titles. The added bonus, of course, is that you have a coffee table book, without the coffee table price.

Last we left the adventuring party, they were camping outside the Cave of Marsh. I anticipated dying to the wizards guarding the crown many times because of their paralytic touch and massive damage. Their attack on the mages can quickly take them out.
I retrieved the crown and prepared for the battle coming next. Astos is the first real boss to face off with the party. Garland is too early to be much of a challenge, and the last two plot related fights (pirates and wizards) are more like mini-bosses. Astos has a spell, Rub, that has a good chance of instantly killing a party member. In fact, it's usually his first action followed by either Fire 2 or 3.
Astos decided to focus his efforts on buffing himself instead, while Kili took MVP for the fight, basically killing him single-handedly (I'm not sure Tont's 2 HP of damage really pushed it over the edge). With the crown I was able to get the Crystal Eye, which the witch Matoya requests in exchange for some powerful herbs that revive the elf king who has a mystic key to unlock magic doors. Behind one of the doors are some explosives that a dwarf needs. This is the longest chain of fetch quests I've seen in the games for this blog.
Beyond the TNT, I also uncover a lot of powerful equipment that I can't use. At least it gets me a lot of gold to help afford the costly spells. With the TNT, a dwarf blow up a land bridge that opens up the wider world . Now the main quest really begins and I can finally do something about these orbs. I've just reached the first town beyond, and the Earth Cave is awaiting my approach.
Session Time: 1h30m (Total Time: 5h30m)
Sorry for the lack of updates. Life has been really stressful and work is crazy. Still is, but I've spent too long away from this, so I'm trying to get back into it. Thank you all for stopping by again and checking it out. I'm definitely devoting more time to this project going forward.
Welcome back! Life is always more important than video games, of course, but hopeful this is a de-stressor for you...
It does help, but it also creates some stress at home when I play for long periods, so I'm trying to limit the longer sessions.
Glad you're back! Sorry to hear about real-life stress, I hope things are better now!
Not really, but I'm tired of waiting for them to get better.
I've been following your blog for quite some time, but not commenting until now.
Glad to see you're back! Have you considered trying one of the patches for Final Fantasy? I wound up having my Final Fantasy cartridge ROM reburned with a bugfix patch that really made the game a whole lot more fun to play.
Vanilla NES Final Fantasy has a ton of bugs, notably that none of the "special" weapons that are supposed to deal extra damage to specific creatures (The Giant Sword for example) actually does any additional damage. There are spells that do the opposite of what is intended (I believe LOK actually reduces your To-Hit, rather than increasing) and a great deal of the elemental protection spells (AFIR, ALIT, etc) don't do anything at all.
A little QA would have gone far.
I was unaware of bugfix patches for my favorite FF game, though I knew about the bugs. I'll have to go search one out...
I wish I remembered which patch I found, but it was compatible with the cartridge's ROM and the guy running nesreproductions.com burned it for me. Works great.
I think I'd rather stick to unmodified versions, or at least officially released versions. The special weapons are really only a drawback for Gioz. I guess the light axe also is limited, but I don't remember many undead once it's found. The spell limitations and handicaps I can work around as well. I really don't like using buffs and debuffs much as I feel like they waste a turn in casting them, especially when the debuff just doesn't work.
I actually bought the PS1 version recently. I could switch to that version... nah I'll just stick with the original for now. I've beaten it before.
@archivis: Someone named AstralEsper made a great patch called Final Fantasy Restored. I highly recommend it. It fixes pretty much every bug; the only one still unfixed, I think, is the INT bug (i.e., higher INT is supposed to increase the power of Black Magic, but doesn't).
I have noticed that Gioz's spells will sometimes out-power Kili's.
Wow, I was reading that and I saw Garland and now I can't get that ancient webcomic, 8-bit theatre out of my head.
I never heard of 8-bit Theater until now. Thanks for wasting the rest of my free time for today....
I'll have to check out 8-bit theater and lose some more free time then.
Don't worry, it goes downhill pretty quickly, I just kept reading it out of habit.
Lies, Canageek, LIES! All those consecutive hours I lost watching the Youtube episodes and then continuing in the comics are proof of its OBJECTIVELY perpetual funniness!
.... Seriously, though, I am sad it won't continue forever especially with 5 more sprite-based Final Fantasy's to draw from.... IMAGINE!
PS: Glad to see you back,Zenic. I kinda dropped off my usual blog-reading spots (bet I have a few hundred hours of CRPG Addict back-logged,too), so I am sorry this greeting is more than a bit late :)
Thanks, and good to see you back as well. Wizardry's been teaching me the true meaning of an unfair game. I'm hoping I've seen the worst of it and can move on soon. Strangely, I'm enjoying it more than Phantasy Star II. That could have to do with grinding while also playing Star Saga Two.
Good to see you posting - and to see your exploits are continuing. :)
Glad to be back. I hope I can get through the 1990s of gaming by the end of the summer at least. We'll see how quickly I can start ramping up my play time.
I quite enjoyed this section of the game. Because I used the peninsula of power on my playthrough I kind of breezed through it. Really enjoyed the battle with the elf guy.
I think the peninsula of power is a less powerful in this games. I remember easily grinding there in Dawn of Souls (the game used MP instead spell points per level). I suppose it's good before getting the mystic key, although at level 11 I was getting hit for nearly half my HP.
The ever present mummies at the north castle are a constant source of experience. The giants in the Earth Cave are seem to be a good deal as well, but take some time to kill. I remember the eye in the ice cave being another good source, but he's hard to get to and can easily kill your party without the right equipment. Beyond that, I can't think of any particularly easy places to grind for levels.
I hope you'll write up your thoughts when we get to the final posting on this game. It'll be interesting to read up on the differences between the versions.
I'm catching up on older articles, so I'm fine with you being less frequent :D
Glad to have a new reader. I'm eager to move forward though, so I hope I can get back to my goal of at least once a week.
I'm glad to see you back, and glad to see Kili kicking ass and taking numbers!
Kili is definitely one of the most powerful characters with his nukes.
I think the animation you recall for the blowing up of the canal is from one of the myriad of remakes.
Glad to see you back blogging!
I did play through the GBA Dawn of Souls version, so maybe I'm remembering that. I also remember tent/cabin/house animation, but I'm pretty sure that's Final Fantasy II (SNES).
Yes, the GBA version, as well as the superior PS1 and other remaks have these animations for blowing up the canal, and at other set points, as well as tent/cabin/house animations.

Facebook Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will do the Nasdaq honors Friday morning, marking his company’s initial public offering by ringing the stock exchange’s bell, meaning that he will sign a screen and press a button from the social network’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., according to reports.
The news was first tweeted by CNBC and later confirmed by TechCrunch.
Nasdaq.com will broadcast the event in real time. Watching is sure to be a nationwide spectator sport for a certain slice of the population, as the media frenzy leading up to the May 18 IPO has been rather feverish.
It appears to be full-steam ahead amid earlier rumors of a possible delay in the IPO, as Facebook documents filed today confirm that the social network will appear on the Nasdaq exchange with the symbol FB. And Bloomberg reported earlier today that shares will only be available until the close of business tomorrow.
Facebook’s share price will be announced Thursday, the day before the hugely anticipated IPO.
Amendments to earlier estimates now give Facebook a value of some $77 billion, and its price-per-share is slated to be in the range of $28 to $35.
TechCrunch predicted that Zuckerberg will give a speech Friday morning, but for Facebook employees only.

62 Reasons You Might Be All Groan UpPosted on December 27th, 2011
Are you a GROAN UP? Someone in that awkward limbo between growing and grown? If so, you’re not alone.
I recently unwrapped the theory of Emerging Adulthood, which suggests that there is a new developmental stage between the transition from adolescence to adult called “emerging adulthood”.
However, I’ve also been conducting my own less-than-academic research around emerging adulthood and my theory of being a GROAN UP. And after months of collecting answers from twentysomethings/thirtysomethings from around the World of Web-ernet (and sprinkling in my own), I present to you what it REALLY means to be ALL GROAN UP – someone in between growing and grown.
1. When you buy loads of cute accessories for your teenage sister, because
obviously you are too GROAN up to wear them! - Kay
2. The thought of becoming an adult makes you toss up a few Fruity Pebbles.
3. You see nothing wrong with still eating Fruity Pebbles.
4. You take your nieces to see cartoon movies just so you don’t look like a weirdo watching a kids movie – Linzy
5. TGIF still means something more to you (aka you might own the entire DVD set of Boy Meets World).
6. You de-stress by coloring with crayola crayons. - Cara
7. At the first sight of snow you hope work is cancelled tomorrow.
8. You stop laughing at Friends and start thinking that Joey’s comments about sex are inappropriate. – Josh
9. You’ve had a new job (or no job) nearly every year for a decade.
10. You still eat mac n cheese for dinner (but now add peas) – Robin
11. When Father’s Day is for YOU
12. When you realize YOU have to DEAL with the car mechanics instead of your dad doing it for you! – Linzy
13. You can’t believe you’re married
14. You can’t believe you’re NOT married
15. You still don’t really know how taxes work but you pretend like you do. ~ Katie
16. You still get called “the girl” at work – A Girl Who Dreams
17. You ironed your dress shirts for the first month of your new job, and then decided a much easier strategy was just to stop believing that wrinkles exists.
18. You say things like, “That Fred Savage was dreamy” ~ Blunt Delivery
19. You bring empty Tupperware to work to take home leftover office food
20. When you make comments like “I was NEVER allowed to wear something like that when I was her age…I wore stretch pants and an over-sized t-shirt!” ~ Alyssa
21. When the last of the ketchup bottle makes a fart noise and you don’t laugh. ~ Julian
22. You realize on the morning of that Mother’s Day is not just for your mom, but also for your wife, who is now a mom. So you run out and buy a glass swan (I might be speaking from experience here)
23. You love listening to NPR now. I mean, it’s talk radio! ~ David
24. You still giggle when someone says balls (maybe just a groan up guy thing)
25. You go back to your home town and talk about all the “developments” that have happened since you’ve been gone ~ Lindsay
26. You thought Mary-Kate and Ashley were adorable. And now they kinda scare you. ~ Katie
27. When you never run out of underwear because you actually stay on top of laundry ~ Ashley
28. When you’re losing hair and gaining babies.
29. Every evening at 7:30pm you scurry to turn on Jeopardy ~ Rachael
30. You grieve all the day when you spill coffee on something that is “dry clean only.”
31. When your first reaction to finding out a friend is pregnant is “congratulations!!” instead of “holy &^%$, what happened!!” ~ Kate
32. You start taking over the counter pain relievers after a really active day of play/moving/living because you actually need them. ~ Lindsay
31. You feel like a kid most of the time, until you see a real kid and think, “good Lord, kids are really young these days.” ~ Mike
32. You chug two-day old coffee because you’re running late and you know if coffee doesn’t enter, you’re not leaving. (Note to Kid-Self for when time machines become available at Best Buy: Never fight the nap).
33. You realize that the cliques in high school are alive & well in the real world too … ~ Jocelyn
34. You need a vacation to recover from your vacation.
35. You have a 12 year old say to you, “My youth pastor was talking about Vanilla Ice and my friends and I thought he was talking about an ice cream flavor,” and you aren’t sure whether to laugh or cry because she was completely serious. ~ Lindsay

When you reference The Never Ending Story and your intern looks at you like your so out of touch………FALCOR!!!!!!
Those silly kids and their lack of appreciation for cinematic masterpieces!
Haha- these are hilarious! My favorite so far is “you’re losing hair and gaining babies”
My own to add is when you find yourself starting a lot of your sentences with “Maybe I’m an old lady, but…” and you’re only 26.
When you start to be annoyed at getting carded buying drinks.
when you start to be annoyed because YOU’RE NOT getting carded buying drinks!
When you FORCE your ID onto anybody selling you alcohol, before they’d even have a chance to ask for it for fear that they might not.
Two drinks puts you out of commission for at least the first 5 hours of the next day.
You understand more references made by your 50 year old co-worker than your 17 year old niece.
You’ve considered buying a mini-van.

My family really doesn’t take vacations to exotic or even genealogical places. We go where family is located – the places we called home at one time. However, along the way we have periodically stopped to see a historical site or be tourists for awhile.
In the summer of 1994, I took a little over three weeks’ vacation back to my mom’s and a few days at my in-laws. Just me and four kids! On the way from Ohio back to Missouri, we stopped at Billie Creek Village located in Parke County, Indiana. If you enjoy stepping back into time and covered bridges, this is a wonderful place to see. Motoring on toward Missouri, we stopped in Hannibal (as we normally do to fill up with gas) and decided to see some Mark Twain historical sights. We toured the Haunted House on Hill Street Wax Museum, sort of. The Wax museum part of it was okay for four young children but as soon as we started into the Haunted area, with chains rattling and screams emanating from the dark, three of the four tore out of there. We walked down the street and took pictures of Samuel Clemens’ boyhood home and the Becky Thatcher House among others.
Two years ago when we reached Hannibal, we stopped so the youngest daughter (not so young any more) could go through the Haunted House. During the Fourth of July Riverfest in Hannibal, the streets are packed with cars and the closest place to park would have been several blocks away. With a dog traveling with us, one person would have to stay behind with her. That’s when we stopped to
turn around at a service station and noticed the Molly Brown Birthplace and Museum. (Molly Brown was a Titanic survivor.) Daughter decided that was just as good as the Haunted House. The home, as expected wasn’t much, but I learned a lot more than I ever thought I could learn about this woman. We spent at least twenty minutes lingering over all the news clippings, studying the furnishings and listening to the guide explain how the small rooms were used by the family.
On the way from Missouri to Ohio recently, we passed through Springfield, Illinois. I mentioned to my husband that “sometime we’ll have to stop to see Lincoln’s home”. Then I began wondering where he was actually buried. As a Lincoln history buff, I would surely have remembered! So as we returned from Ohio retracing our path back to Missouri, as we got closer to Springfield, I asked my husband if we could just see how far the house was off the highway. So we detoured into Springfield through the old part, following the signs until we got there. Once again, we had the dog with us so our daughter volunteered to stay with her while the rest of us went into the Visitor’s Center to get the information we needed about walking through the house. It’s a free tour, but not self-guided. The tour didn’t start for 30 minutes, and I didn’t feel we should take that long with the daughter waiting on us. The parking is $2 (basically on the honor system) which is a deal when you consider so many historical sights now charge for tours. So we inquired about the tomb. It wasn’t that far away – however, it was closed for three days while they did some cement work. We were allowed to walk to the house, walk around the house, and see two other houses (inside too) that had been restored to their original condition. It appears that the historical society is restoring several of the surrounding homes and buildings in that area. You can go to Lincoln Home and Lincoln’s Tomb for more information.
The moral of the story is . . . if you even think you might get to stop at a historic sight or even a courthouse or cemetery on your genealogical quest – call, write or email to make sure it is open when you will be there, if there are any fees for parking or tours, hours of operation, what type of parking you can expect, and if there are any other festivals happening at the same time.

Twitter +.
Much easier to have a computer track this down for you — and then ask the computer to write up a story about it, too.
That’s what Narrative Science, the start-up that specializes in robot-written stories, did earlier this week. The result isn’t elegant, but it gets the job done, in a brute force sort of way..
No Pulitzer for that one, but that’s not the point. This is a work in progress that’s meant to illustrate an interesting project Narrative Science is working on: The Chicago-based company got its start by creating stories out of “structured” data sets, like baseball box scores. Now it is looking at “unstructured” data — like the thousands of messages that Twitter puts out each second — as story fodder, too.
Stories about things people say on Twitter aren’t super compelling (though if you check Techmeme, you’ll see that my fellow typers and I sure make a lot of them). But if Narrative Science gets good at this, it could end up somewhere interesting.
“This is a really basic story, but it’s fully automated,” says CEO Stuart Frankel. “No human touched it at all. You can see where this thing is going.”
Meanwhile, Frankel says, Narrative Science’s core business is taking off. The company, which raised $6 million last year, now has 30 clients, many of whom use the company to produce stories and reports they use internally. But you can see public examples of it via publishers like Forbes, which is using the service to crank out automated earnings previews.
Again, those previews aren’t made up of sterling prose, but they are very serviceable. Which means Forbes can either save the money it would have spent paying someone to mash that stuff out — or it can free up a writer to do the interesting kind of stories that only humans can do.
And now I’ll save myself a few minutes of work by citing myself from last year, where I tried to assure myself that Narrative Science wasn’t going to put me out of business: “The trick for content makers like myself is to find work that only content makers like myself can do — work where human qualities like experience, judgment and creativity get rewarded. And if we can’t do that, we ought to be doing something else, anyway.”

December 6, 2008: A date which will live in infamy.
They're not only going bankrupt, they're also going to go out and gather up every car they've ever made and destroy those too?
Seems like they would save a lot of money for restructuring by going ahead and letting the Ford and Chevy pickups, the Jeeps and Suburbans and PT cruisers continue to drive around.
Who cares about the iconic appeal?
Loosing Duesenberg and Packard (the early Packards, like mine) that was the loss of icons.
Beyond the, imho, silly iconic chit chat, there are legitimate financial and strategic problems with the decimation of domestic control and development of auto production.
Imagine an America with no more Corvettes! No more Caddies, Trans Ams, Camaros or Mustangs. No Ford or Chevy pick up trucks; no Jeeps or Suburbans. Not one PT Cruiser.
Is that supposed to be good or bad?
I kid, I kid. Who could stand to go without seeing the beautiful PT Cruiser in action?
Why does this blogger think that these cars would be gone? That's not what would happen if the companies were allowed to go bankrupt. These cars would still be made.
Don't worry, our salvation is at hand.
Obama will save us all with his plan for a new Civilian Conservation Corps and Work Projects Administration, and that will revive the economy so greatly that we will all be buying up American cars.
Just imagine all the jobs he will create handing you unemployed people a shovel and telling you to go work a road gang, not to mention all the people working to change light bulbs!
So what if the day laborers down at the 7-11 will get all these new jobs building roads and rebuilding school buildings? Your medical records will be on a computer! So that in itself is going to super-charge our economy!
Yes, a new day is dawning!
Who cares?! Honestly...the Mustang. Does anyone drive those? Anyone besides 16-year-olds in the South? And what's so damned special about the Jeep Cherokee? Chrysler has long since f-ed up the Jeep line. There's what? 15 models now. And they all look the same.
Get over it. American cars are crap. And not only because they are ugly. But because the people who make them are ugly, too. All those damned union workers making god-knows-what for driving a couple screws are finally about to get what's coming to them. Let them compete in the marketplace. Let them justify $25 an hour plus healthcare plus pension in any other industry.
General Motors is dead. Long live Toyota. Chrysler is dead. Long live Honda. Ford is dead. Long live Nissan.
LOL
"No Ford or Chevy pick up trucks; no Jeeps or Suburbans. Not one PT Cruiser. All gone..."
Isn't that the "green" lefty's most orgasmic dream ever? I thought they hated all cars except for the Prius and those ugly little "Smart" cars? They should be happy about this! Better get in shape! That 40 mile bike commute is gonna be murder!
I didn't click on the link because I'm afraid it might not be a joke.
Better safe than sorry.
"I didn't click on the link because I'm afraid it might not be a joke."
Oh it's a joke alright. Not intentionally so, but a joke nonetheless.
"What pathogens could possibly be responsible for KOS?"
Whatever it is, it certainly isn't the contagious happiness from the other day. marks, the brands, the styles and what have you, are tangibles that will survive, thanks to intellectual property. Sure it may all belong to somebody else, but it will survive. Move along now.
The typos are the clue that it's not a joke.
Detroit faces many challenges. The biggest is: innovate or die.
"Rice burning Nissons [sic]"? Sounds like someone's clinging to "antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment."
"all looted by ultra-conservatives eager to punish generations of American workers for the sin of not voting for the GOP in acceptable numbers"
I love the logical inversion demonstrated by the above. Yes, they are being "punished", how? By not getting the taxpayers to subsidize their excessive compensation packages. What is threatened is that they will have to depend on the health of corporations which their unions squeezed the lifeblood out of.
Twin,
There are a lot of odd things about your post, but I'll just address one of them for now:
You wrote:
"The simple fact is that cars can be made just as well in 3rd world countries that aren't bound by obscene 40 hour work weeks, consumer- and worker-safety laws, and retirement plans.
The American worker is going to have to learn to compete with the cheap labor available in Mexico, Haiti, Bangladesh, and throughout the 3rd world."
Third world countries like, what, Tennessee? We're getting a Volkswagen plant in my town next year and couldn't be more thrilled. And we've lost out on at least a half dozen others who went to neighboring states. The South is just full of non-union, good wages, good benefits "foreign" car manufacturers. These are the folks that Detroit can't compete with.
In other words, imagine an America without a bunch of shitty, dangerous gas-guzzling cars and trucks, and without a huge bloated, whiny unionized blue-collar workforce.
Yeah, what will we ever do.
This is our chance to kill off one of the unions. Let's not pass it up, even if it causes further economic woes. We can ultimately lay the blame where it belongs: at the feet of the middle class. It's wake-up time for the overstuffed American comfort class. No more nanny state for the masses.
The middle class has to snap out of it's hippy dippy delusions about "the American Dream," or face the consequences. The global economy simply cannot sustain middle class incomes for a large proportion of the population. The lasting sin of big government/New Deal liberalism was creating the unreasonable expectation that middle class can be sustained at post-New Deal levels. Thanks to the Democrat Party, hundreds of millions of middle class Americans now feel entitled to live in their own homes, have access to world-class health care, and even send their kids to college. That kind of fancy living has never been sustainable for "the masses," as we are learning now. Compare this to India, or China, where 80% of the population lives in poverty, forming a dynamic labor pool that propels their economies.
The simple fact is that cars can be made just as well in 3rd world countries that aren't bound by high wages, 40 hour work weeks, heath care coverage, consumer- and worker-safety legislation, retirement plans, and other Democrat-largess.
The American worker is going to have to learn, like it or not, to compete with cheap labor from, e.g., Mexico and Haiti. And the American middle class is going to have to shrink back down to sustainable levels. That was the whole point of NAFTA and GATT and the other free trade agreements, and we're finally seeing a long-needed reordering of global economic priorities as a result.
Historically dynamic capitalist economies are able to sustain
— a small class of wealthy (1% or so of the population). This is the productive engine that drives investment, innovation
— a modest middle class, maybe 5%-10% of the population, to service corporations and the wealth. These are the professionals: doctors, lawyers, skilled tech jobs.
The only viable role for the remaining 90%, give or take, is service as a flexible labor market.
People have been doing fine under these conditions for centuries, but the American middle class is at a disadvantage, now, because they've come to expect (feel entitled to) a pampered yet unsustainable middle class existence. The transition to sustainability is going to be difficult for people who have come to expect middle class comfort.
So: Let's reorder the economy on a sound basis and take this chance to finally kill off the UAW, and with it the old liberal notion of a broad middle class.
This first step will lead to additional course corrections: Once the middle class shrinks down to sustainable levels, ignoring the internal contradictions of Social Security financing will become impossible. Within a few years, the entire system of federal entitlements will implode, liberating our economy once and for all from the restraints placed on it by 80 years of corrupt Dem leadership.
Yup. The end of the line for the big three. Yet Kos misses the point.
It won't be the end of the "American" auto industry. Just the end of three crappy, bloated companies that pay unionized workers too much money to make inferior vehicles that not enough consumers want to buy.
Once the Big Three are bankrupt and gone, the marketplace will have a vacuum. There will be a "pro-American" market out there for American-designed, American-built, American-brand cars. Someone will fill the void with a new company. And they will have the opportunity to do so with the benefit of lessons learned from the missteps of Ford, Chrysler and GM. THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is Change You Can Believe In.
Taxpayer bailouts, on the other hand, hardly represent Change.
To people who still think unions are a good idea: this is the pot of chickens coming home to roost.
The Mustang is still a great car!
The Big 3 is doomed. It is a rotting corpse. Let it die and replace it with foreign manufacturers on American soil.
Even if the stupid union contracts (including the ones paying people not to work) are torn up, the ultra-generous pension and healthcare plans cannot be supported. There is no way UAW or Congress agrees to cut those. Therefore, thee is no way those get cut. Therefore, they remain a millstone around the Big 3's neck.
The Big 3 is a rotting corpse, and Congress just wants to prop it up, maybe inject it with a little juice so it can shamble around aimlessly like some kind of zombie for a few years until it needs another hit of zombie juice (taxpayer dollars).
We can only hope that this infection does not spread to other industries. That's the left-wing goal--to turn us into a socialist country by destroying our economy and folding the broken pieces into our federal government. That's why lefties always oppose sound economic policy and always support hoaxes like "Global Warming." They know that to achieve their goals, they must bring America to its knees.
Of course, in any good zombie movie, you know the ending in advance: we're all f#cked. This is the same way.
Think about what a great country this is where one can go from potential heiress to the Pierce-Arrow dynasty to starving art school student to tenured law professor at a top tier law school to world-renowned Blog Goddess zipping around in a precision European sports car jobby all in the course of one short lifetime!
My country tis of thee!
I think Congress should bring back the Studebaker, too, just for good measure.
"potential heiress to the Pierce-Arrow dynasty"
More like potential heiress to a mechanic shop.
And Meade has the bio and motion picture rights? You lucky bastard!
Pretend it's Cuba.
They have kept American cars from the 1950's and earlier going for half a century.
After you are done pretending, start dealing with the 21st century, where America is no longer ascendant in the auto industry.
It's called Change. Isn't that what the Kos crowd has been waiting for
"And Meade has the bio and motion picture rights? You lucky bastard!"
You may say I'm a dreamer... a lucky bastard dreamer.
I like to think of myself as an average ordinary blue collar premier myth maker babe magnet.
So we've come to the point where someone who thinks a business should stand or fall on its own merits, rather than being nationalized in part or whole, is an "ultra-conservative". Not just conservative, an ultra conservative.
I guess now if you believe in private property and free markets at all, that alone makes you somewhat suspect. I guess in the Obama Nation, the free market is just so yesterday.
It's been at least 5 years since the last Trans Am was made.
Not sure what the connection is between the GOP and the collapsing American auto industry. Ford, GM, and Chrysler have been dying of the same self-imposed illness for 20 years, through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Blaming their plight on anyone but themselves misses the real issue at hand. Forgive us for being skittish about dumping billions more in tax dollars to keep their lights on for another six months when these companies haven't even proven they can run themselves properly.
That Pierce-Arrow background seems familiar.
My grandfather was a Packard mechanic, who went on to work for himself.
But, then the legacies diverge; I bought myself a Packard because I was inspired by pictures of my grandfather next to these big, beautiful cars from the past.
My grandfather only had joyful memories of his Packard days--contagious memories for me.
P.S.
Thanks for losing the typo, I noticed it, but didn't feel like deleting and correcting the comment.
I love the wishful thinking in "let the Big 3 die, we'll all Buy Toyota".
First, why would Toyota build more plants in the USA if the big 3 are gone? They build them now because of the explicit and implicit threat of tariffs and quotas. A threat which will go away, when the big 3 go.
Second, once gone the Auto industry will never come back. Goodbye, millions of jobs. Who's going to hire them? Are to they all to be government employees?
Third, we are now running $500 billion dollar trade deficits with the rest of the world. What are we going to give the Japanese in return for all these shiny new Toyota's? US assets? More worthless dollars?
The same people who engineered the subprime fiasco, engineered the $700 wall street bailout fiasco, are now saying we need the big 3 to die. Hmmmm.....
The big three should leave the US, find low tax countries with workers who want to work, build cars to sell to the world, be successful.
Where to begin with RC's know-nothing comment. Treatises could be written.
They build them now because of the explicit and implicit threat of tariffs and quotas.
No. They don't. Foreign manufacturers build plants here now because they are profitable. That's why businesses are in business. To make money. Note where the plants are built. Are they built in Michigan, where unions have a stranglehold on the economy? Or are they built in the South, where labor is far cheaper?
we are now running $500 billion dollar trade deficits with the rest of the world
Why is that, RC? Why has the United States run trade deficits for decades? Is it some conspiracy? No. It's because our currency is strong and our labor is expensive. If your goal is truly to get rid of the trade deficit, the thing to do is to lower labor costs substantially and decrease the cost of our money.
I don't understand what the problem is with bankruptcy. These are failed businesses. They can't pay their bills. They need to completely change the way they do business. Bankruptcy allows that.
Finally, I read something the other day that was intriguing. The bailout, rightly, has involved banks. If you want money, go to a bank. That's where all the money from the government has gone.
Republicans did not destroy the American automobile industry, and the implication that they did is fatuous. It was destroyed by the UAW and management both assuming that they could be as inefficient as they wished as long as all American manufacturers were more or less equally burdened. It didn't work out. Life's a bitch. It only gets worse for America if we force our economy to drag along a zombie automobile industry. Both UAW and management made the bed. They should now be forced to lie in it.
I agree RcOcean. It is time to look out for our nation's self-interests.
Why doesn't Congress ever discuss the financial incentives the Japaneses auto companies get from their govt? Oh sure Congress delves into the national healthcare in Japan because Dems want that here too. But I an sure the Japanese govt gives plenty of other yen! Plus the Janps and Asians buy very few of our cars? Why is that?
Let's have an economy that looks like Japan's. So free and growing so much.
While we're at it, let's get a criminal justice system like Japan's, too. Rights, shmights.
I feel compelled to reiterate something: we will never, ever, ever erase the American trade deficit or even begin to start competing with foreign manufacturers in any industry where wages are high. It's basically a mathematical impossibility.
How can people not understand this? You can't expect to sell more of your stuff when it is far more expensive than other stuff that is the same.
If you want high wages, you cannot also have a trade surplus. To believe otherwise makes you a moron.
I must assume that all the military's trucks/ airplanes/ and other assembly line produced stuff will always be available as imports from the friends we have e all over the world. But what if they cause Co2 and have been banned by the UN in the future?
Traditional -- Certainly, because no American entrepreneur would fill that niche. Never. If these three companies go bankrupt, another American vehicle will never be made. Bankruptcy is death, and birth is not allowed.
"My grandfather only had joyful memories of his Packard days--contagious memories for me."
If you mean to imply that my grandfather was bitter and groused about his misfortune, you are wrong. I never heard him speak about it at all. I have had to imagine the disappointments he had. He never talked about anything like that.
Precisely how does our Congress think we could handle another WWII without an auto industry to make the trucks, the tanks and the parts for repair?
How does our Congress plan to handle the 1 MILLION pensioners from GM who suddenly don't have a pension? That's one in 300 Americans.
How does our Congress plan on handling Michigan loosing another 800,000 jobs like we lost in the past 8 years.. but this time all at once?
What the hell are they thinking? They've given buttloads of cash without hesitation to the financial firms who have used it for bonuses and to buy other foreign companies but STILL AREN'T LENDING money to people to buy cars!
Seven:
Is Japan's standard of living significantly lower than ours? If not, how do they produce cars at a lower cost? After we factor in the elimination of the US disadvantage for pensions / benefits.
Regarding future pension promises that are not funded, Congress is to blame.
Congress has sat idly by for years while some big businesses and many many state and local govts devised overly generous pensions but did not fund them.
That was also a violation of the law of mathematics Seven Machos mentioned.
Why is it always assumed that the only alternatives are to bail out Detroit as is, or watch GM, Ford and Chrysler disappear without a trace?
When United Airines went bankrupt did all its airplanes immediately vanish?
These companies have contractual obligations with their labor force and dealer networks that are unsustainable. If they are to regain profitability, they need to renegotiate these deals under Chapter 11 protection. Let the bankruptcy laws work as they were intended - there is no pain-free way for the government to "save" Detroit.
Seven,
Ignoring the fact that a lot of folks won't buy a car from a company in bankruptcy, and ignoring the fact that bankruptcies drag on for a long time; are you suggesting that Chapter 11 (w/o the gov financing anyway) will not lead to Chapter 7 in our current situation? Then, add in the problem of selling cars while a long (likely Chapter 7) bankruptcy works through the courts.
If you don't care about the loss of the domestic design and development control in autos, what do you think will replace this work and innovation? Are you a promoter of the race to the bottom philosophy?
Austerity didn't work for Hoover, and it didn't work for FDR. And, we are blessed that the US is the biggest of the too-big-to-fail, hence the big money of the world is still forced to dump their cash into Treasuries. Treasuries provide a return, even if it's almost zero on the shorter stuff--that's still better than losing money. Treasuries are the way the world's big money gets stuffed under the proverbial mattress.
Let's quasi-arbitrage this cheap money to find a floor so that things can get moving in the right direction. Hopefully, the Fed will work to lock in the maximum amount of cheap money for the longest terms possible.
P.S.
Maybe the foriegn companies were worried about quotas, like we had while Reagan was president, so they started assembling here.
P.P.S.
We're like a developing country to the foriegn companies who assemble cars in the States. The home countries keep a lot of the high powered technology, innovation, and development: we do the grunt work.
They are getting better than us at the making advancements. That seems like it could be a long term problem. At least we're still blessed with a lot of domestic material resources, but we should probably look at our human capital relative to other developed countries. Maybe our material resources have made us overconfident; how much of our growth is the result of our commodity wealth versus our brilliance. Would Japan be so advanced if they had the crutch of a lot of domestic commodity resources?
P.P.P.S
Folks may want to read recent Sully posts (including dissents) about health care and pensions.
No PT Cruiser or Jeep Cherokee? Where do I sign up?
Seriously, those are two utter piles of shit. Until recently so was the Mustang; now it's just a half pile of shit. It may look nice, but the suspension is outdated crap.
That aside, Ford isn't going under. They are actually getting their house in order. The only reason they showed up in DC is they heard free money was being handed out. Truth is, though Ford will never admit it, they will benefit if GM or Chrysler go under. Not only will it reduce the [over] supply of cars, it will give them incredible control at the bargaining table--in fact, they may just tell the Union to go to hell and hire scabs, which will be easy as pie.
Chrysler is the worse of the three and should have already gone under. The only thing decent they make is the Viper (which loses money) and the Dodge Ram Pickup (especially with the Cumins diesel, which Ford would love to get their hands on since their diesel engine isn't very good.)
Somewhat recently I worked on a project that forced me to learn about GMs part distribution system. It's dreadfully "designed" and horribly inefficient. (By contrast, Ford's part distribution system is a dream.)
People won't buy a car from a company that is in bankruptcy? Really? Did they not fly American while it was in bankruptcy? That seems a hell of a lot more perilous.
It's one thing to buy a car, quite another to put your life in the hands of a pilot.
This argument is absurd and spurious. Next, please. And, really. Try harder.
Japan produces lower-cost cars because it has lower costs.
traditionalguy at 2:41, a lot of the military's vehicles come from AM General, which is not one of the Big 3, and not, to my knowledge anyway, involved in the bailout negotiations. They build the H2 Hummers for GM and would be hurt if they lost that marketing channel, but would they be hurt enough to have to shut down production of military vehicles? I don't know enough to say, but I doubt it.
Bradleys are built by BAE Land and Armaments, an international company with its US HQ in Minneapolis.
It's not WW II any more, when the auto companies turned the assembly lines over to military production.
Airplanes, now, that might be another matter. Though the contract for tankers has not yet been given to Airbus; Boeing may yet prevail.
The auto companies are not going bankrupt - Congress will not allow it, except under some kind of hybrid bailout/bankruptcy that preserves union jobs and wages. Isn't it strange the auto companies have been bargaining as if they're in a position of strength? It's because they're as strong politically as they are weak financially.
The biggest benefit to bankruptcy from the auto companies' perspective is it allows them to renegotiate union contracts. There's no way the Democrats are going to cross the UAW like that, even if it means a permanent IV of taxpayer money into the sector.
The only real question is whether the Democrats bring enough Republicans along to make it a "bi-partisan" bailout.
My daughter tells me that the new ones are worthless and ugly.
I don't think she'd drive a new Mustang if it arrived at Christmas with a big bow on the hood.
She wants an 80-something Camaro.
Weird kid.
The Corvette is an amazing car; it's highest performance models are in many ways superior to cars manufactured by Porsche, Ferrari, Maserati and others.
I look forward to the day when I can buy a new Corvette at a price that reflects a restructured GM's labor cost.
That being said, I miss and still yearn for the Nash Metropolitan. Gone, but never forgotten.
The new Republican Slogans for 2010:
"$700 billion for Wall Street but not one Dime for Detroit"
Or:
"American Workers Drop Dead - you make too much."
Should be a winner.
Seven,
That you are someone who would make a major durable good purchase of a car from a company that is broke, with an uncertain resolution (Chap 11 or 7, and gov $ or no gov $, and unknown macroeconomic expectations), says a lot about you.
If there were more folks like you it wouldn't matter what kinds of uncompetitive cars were produced domestically, some sucker would buy them anyway.
"all looted by ultra-conservatives eager to punish generations of American workers for the sin of not voting for the GOP in acceptable numbers"
Actually the problem was that Democrats forced the US auto companies auto companies to build small cars that no one wanted to buy at a price that would allow the companies to make a profit. (Foreign companies could make those cars profitable for reasons that had a lot to do with more amenable labor unions.) But, all of the great cars will not disappear. In fact they will be on the roads for decades to come as people refuse to buy the cars Congress is going to design for Detroit to produce in return for subsidizing them.
Synova,
Does she need a theme song ?
"American Workers Drop Dead - you make too much."
Should be a winner.
Of course it's not a *winner*.
It's just true. And truth isn't very popular.
It's much more popular to tell people that corporations are evil and have unlimited funds and there are no down-sides to making them pay you more.
Granted, no one is saying that the auto-makers are victims. They dug their own hole.
The question is, should taxpayers bail out an industry that has been bailed out before?
The rant Ann quotes is pretty typical, it seems, of an argument that simply does not admit the existence of economic reality. No, it's just mean and vindictive motivations... the only reason that "conservatives" do anything. Hate.

The new Republican Slogans for 2010:
"$700 billion for Wall Street but not one Dime for Detroit"
You seem to have forgotten that most Republicans did not vote for the Wall Street bailout. You also should note that most of the money donated from Wall Street went to Democrats. Also consider how many from the Clinton Administration were on Wall Street making millions per year. Think of Raines, Gorelick, and most of all Robert Rubin. How much of the $700 billion will go to George Soros, not a friend of Republicans? But, I think you have nailed another Democratic Party big lie.
I am pro-bailout. Lending is the basis of our free economy. Without banking, everything else falls apart quickly. See, for example, the Great Depression, when for years Roosevelt and Hoover kept money tight, further constricting a constricted economy.
I am convinced that people on the fringe left and fringe right simply do not understand economics. How else could you possibly believe that the way to save a struggling business is to keep it exactly in a position where it is losing money? If the unions and management wanted to solve their problems, they could do so, easily. They don't, though, so to hell with them. Bankruptcy law is there for a reason.
Finally, what's so special about the auto companies? Nothing. Not one thing. What about General Growth. They own malls. Mall are vital for shopping. What about Fred's Bakery and Big Schlong's Porno Emporium? Why not those businesses?
"What about Fred's Bakery and Big Schlong's Porno Emporium? Why not those businesses? "
Donuts and porn - there will always be demand.
Talk about too big to fail-- Fred's and Big Schlong's going out of business would truly be Black Swan events.
I'm finally reading Amity Shlaes' book on the Great Depression, "The Forgotten Man." Two of her complaints with FDR and the New Dealers were their insistence on making business the scapegoat, and the effect of his "bold, persistent experimentation," both of which frightened investors into keeping their money on the sidelines due to the persistent uncertainty.
Seems like the opposite is taking place now. We have people like this Kos diarist, a leftist, who gets teary-eyed thinking about GM, Ford and Chrysler and can't imagine life without them. It's Feel-o-nomics.
I suppose Feel-o-nomics creates another kind of uncertainty. Companies could make the tough choices to survive in this economy. Or they could create a wave of sentimental nostalgia and hope they can use that to get a bailout.
Which other businesses would the left give a sentimental bailout? Here are some "deserving" candidates:
Apple
Starbucks
The Simpsons
The New Yorker
Patagonia
The Boston Red Sox
Burt's Bees
CBS
Wham-O (makers of Frisbee and the Hula Hoop)
American Spirit Cigarettes
Nike
I have always thought that John Stodder was one of the most sensible and intelligent posters on the Althouse blog. But to suggest that the Boston Red Sox deserve a bailout can only mean one thing.
You sir are a communist.
Whole Foods
Google
Ben and Jerry's
MSNBC
Harper Collins
The New York Times
Can't let any of these irreplaceable companies fail.
But to suggest that the Boston Red Sox deserve a bailout can only mean one thing.
You sir are a communist.
John Cusack and Ben Affleck love them and would be very upset if anything ever happened to them. I realize they're profitable now, but you can never be too sure. They deserve at least $2 billion.
Chip Ahoy said... basic analysis is correct, save the motive was not to screw the middle class, but enrich the wealthy further. The mechanism was the informal Bretton Woods II, where American Elites agreed to let cheap Asian labor wipe out manufacturing and depress wages in services and thus give themselves 10 digit GNP Growth. In return they would expect to honor the dollar's dominance and give America's Elites, particularly in the financial and real estate sectors, a cut of the action on the recycled Dollar.
It was a brainchild of ultraconservatives in the Reagan Administration. America would then be the "knowledge economy" where we would have all the IT workers and the experts the Asians needed to make their new ex-American industries prosper. And they thought we would dominate new technology, like cell phones, fiber optics, plasma screen TVs.
And all the Asian dollars ploughed back in could go into Gov't, which would allow supply side conservatives to massively grow the Government under Reagan AND cut taxes.
It worked, just like someone quitting his job to be a poker player and using his inheritance and home equity to get a big line of credit. Meaning - it worked for a while. The middle class was told, despite their huge unease about factory after factory closing, that "Exciting" new jobs were coming. The losses had little to do with the manufacturing or services jobs being union or not. The only criteria was if Japan, then later China, Pakistan, Indonesia, and India could do it cheaper than the American.
The trade deficit exploded. More unease. The masses were told "real estate!" was the answer - nothing need be made in America anymore but houses and "the small niche military market that needs domestic product."
Now the crap has hit the fan.
I don't care if John Cusack, Joan Cusack or your ball sack loves them, there is one thing that is perfectly clear:
BOSTON SUCKS!!!!!!!!!
And that dweeb Ben Afleck dumped a hot chica with a sweet ass for a skinny buck tooth sckank so what the hell does he know about the price of beans.
What is Burt's Bees?
The 140000 UAW members don't make all that much more than the non-unionized workers at the foreign transplant factories. The bulk of the almost $30/hr difference is benefits, which I believe includes retiree benefits. If all the UAW members work a 2000 hour year, the aggregate extra cost to Detroit is around $8 billion per year. GM should have gone Ch11 a few quarters ago when they became technically insolvent but still had the cash reserves to get through it. Ford will probably be OK and its interesting that of the Detroit 3, they are the ones with a product guy in the lead, even though his signature product is the Boeing 777. Chrysler is private and not too big to fail. Their IP of any value - mostly Jeep - will be sold and soldier on.
And the US will still not get a clue that we need to make things and incent and respect who can and do.
Ben and Jerry's?
Maybe not.
This place in Seattle had it's Ben and Jerry's replaced with Red Mango.
At least they still have two standalone Starbucks, plus one in the QFC, and another one in the Barnes and Noble--I did mention this is in Seattle.
What is Burt's Bees?
"Earth friendly Natural Personal Care for the Greater Good."
"At Burt’s Bees, our goal is to help create a world where people have the information and tools they need to make the highest ethical choices and do the best for themselves, their families and the environment."
Their signature product seems to be some kind of organic lip balm, but they also make shampoo, skin creme, cologne, etc. The lip balm works pretty good.
Interesting that liberals comprise most of Red Sox Nation, since the dirty secret is the Sox were the last team to be integrated -- fully 12 years after Jackie Robinson joined the Dodgers.
Yet my Dodgers seem to have no cachet among the glitterati. Our most famous fan is Alyssa Milano.
Boston teams have always been the most racist teams in every sport. It is just typical of the liberal hypocrisy that they pretend that it isn't so.
This is of course not such a big issue anymore since black athletes won't play baseball anymore.
Oh and Alyssa Milano sucks!!!
But in a good way.
A very very good way.
If Cuba can have the same American cars forever, so should America.
Quick, Congress, put yourself in charge and make this wish come true!
I am feeling the fuzzy, cooling effects of Burt's Bees lip balm as we speak. It's a miracle product, really, particularly in a cold Chicago winter.
U use it all the time. I have friends who are addicted to the stuff.
I use it all the time. Typos can ruin a good joke.
I always get more edumicated here. It pays to ask if you don't know something.
I have a tube of Bert's Bees lip balm. The kids may steal my Chapstick but they never steal my Bert's Bees. My husband asked to use it once and was very sorry. I don't like it either. Bleh... smells like perfume.
Chap Stick is a lot better than it used to be.
Then there is good old Carmex.
Just never put it through the washer and dryer. Trust me. Worse than crayons.
Ford is anti-gay. I hope they go bankrupt.
California, too, Downtown. And virtually every other state, and nation.
The auto industry is 4% of US GDP. Over $500 billion a year.
Sure you can let it go bust, but the cost will be a hell of a lot more than $35 billion.
Yes, I hope California goes bankrupt too. I hope your whole fucking country goes bankrupt.
I'm enjoying your Depression.
Downtown -- What nation with stunning GDP growth do you call your own?
I've said it before - but I really do think that the bankruptcy of the Big 3 would be a great capstone in George W. Bush's legacy.
Please let it happen.
The worse shape the economy is in on January 20th, the more breathing room Obama will get to enact his agenda.
My country enjoyed double digit growth last year.
I'll start calling myself an American again on January 20th.
Sane people don't wish ill on their own country.
If you actually do care about the US economy though, it is important not to let these companies go under.
Nobody's buying cars because people are worried about the economy. They are worried about their jobs and their savings. So they make their existing cars go farther. That causes the economy to slow or shrink. But they can only make their cars go so far. Eventually they buy new ones and that helps the economy grow. Well if these companies aren't here, the US will never experience the rebound will. Japan and Korea will instead.
That might be good for the world's economy, but I'm not sure its good for the US. Those jobs, 11% of the world's manufacturing industry, will be gone forever.
I think they should do some sort of restructuring, maybe allowing one of them to go under and get absorbed by one of the remaining 2.
Here is a tip for you if you lost your job and need to make some money. Bet big on Oklahoma in the BCS championship game vs. Florida.
You can make some money too on Penn State in the Rose Bowl and I bet Texas Tech will win too though I am not sure who Texas Tech will be playing.
AJ Lynch - It's not my country. I've already left. US voters have made it very clear that they don't want gay people living there.
Hmm DTL I must have missed that ballot question....what did it ask something like "Are you in favor of gay people living in the USA?"
Just what we need, to follow the economic prescriptions of a raving lunatic who believes that the world revolves him and his gayness.
Yes Seven - Your economic policies, practiced by George W. Bush - have just done wonders for this economy.
AJ Lynch - when you pass constitutional amendments that say "Gays are now second class citizens" that's exactly the message you are sending to gay people - that they are not welcome in your midst.
Fine. I listened. Now I get to laugh at your Depression. I had a smile on my face when I read Friday's jobs report.
Enjoy your "time abroad," Downtown. As someone who knows quite a bit about consular law, I can assure you that it's tremendously difficult to renounce American citizenship. So, when Obama becomes president, and everything automatically becomes rosy again, we'll welcome you "back" with open arms.
"I'll start calling myself an American again on January 20th."
That's nice. We, however, will continue to call you an insufferable, needy, sociopathic faggot.
I'm not renouncing my citizenship. I still have to pay taxes, and even if I renounced my citizenship - I STILL have to pay taxes for 10 years.
That's why I still vote. But I don't have to live there. And my earnings and income are now helping the economy of another country.
"My country enjoyed double digit growth last year."
What, in the sex tourism industry? They should offer you a medal for, uh, single-handedly causing that windfall.
At least I have a job Palladian. And I'm not fat. And I have friends.
"And my earnings and income are now helping the economy of another country."
How many Thai boys can you buy on 45K a year?
Palladian - Next to gaypatriot - the most self-loathing gay person in America.
"At least I have a job Palladian. And I'm not fat. And I have friends."
How much do you have to pay them? Is it by the hour?
How racist can you be against Asians Palladian?
We already know that you didn't vote for Obama, solely because he's black. Now we realize that you don't like Asians either.
Shocker.
I am betting that Downtown is hunkered down in his efficiency in Chelsea right now, masturbating with seething hatred.
I feel sorry for gay people who are fat. Gay men care a lot about looks.
If I was in Chelsea right now - I'd be out drinking with my friends.
Now I'm heading off to the gym.
Bye.
Bye Seven.
You might want to know that the mask you are showing in your profile is quite popular in gay S&M clubs.
Good day.
Yeah, I'm sure my mask is popular at gay S&M clubs. You'll see guys wearing it all over La Lucha in Mexico City, just for example.
I thought you were leaving. What happened? You can't quit me, I guess.
"Palladian - Next to gaypatriot - the most self-loathing gay person in America."
Haha. I'm not self-loating. I loathe you.
When did you finally come out of the closet? When you were 45? That's funny. See, I've been "out" since I was a teenager in conservative rural Pennsylvania, back when being "out" actually carried some risk. At the same time, you spent those years on your knees in restrooms and alleyways all the while pretending to be straight during the day because you were too much of a pussy to be honest with yourself and the world. And now that everyone responds to gayness with a shrug and a yawn, you're suddenly SUPERFAGGOT! Hurling SUPER POWERED insults with impunity and anonymity at those of us who dare "disagree" with you! Able to repulse and sicken people, straight and gay, with a single blog comment!
You're pathetic, Mary.
"We already know that you didn't vote for Obama, solely because he's black. Now we realize that you don't like Asians either."
I know! I even wore my Klan hood and carried a burning cross to my polling station in a public school in south Brooklyn. And those fucking Asians! Man I hate them! I'm calling my Taiwanese and Japanese friends right now to tell them how much I don't like them!
I don't care. Every American car I've bought, including the Saturn, has been a disappointment.
The trucks were OK, but still not as good.
The sad thing is my Toyota Corolla was made in Georgia.
It's not American workers that are the problem. It's American car companies. If American workers are building Toyotas, they seem to do a better job.
Jeeps have been built by: Bantam. Ford, GM, Willys, AMC, Chrysler, Mercedes (Daimler) and now a hedge fund. I expect that Jeep will end up somewhere, the more important issue for sports car and muscle car people is what will happen to the Connor Ave. Viper plant? I would also expect Corvette and Mustang to survive, with the high-end Corvettes as their American competition and Porsche as their primary European competition Viper does not have an easy road. Viper also doesn't seem a logical fit for any of the world's majors except for Toyota and their Toyota Racing Division, however Toyota has their own problems. I've been musing that maybe Viper could end up being owned by a group of (or individual) wealthy Viper Club members. Viper is no Pierce Arrow, but they are America's most outrageous modern cars.
I wish I were in Chelsea right now.
"I wish I were in Chelsea right now."
London, New York or Clinton?
Pretending she was my intern heh.
So this gay guy walks into a bar full of nine-year-old boys in Thailand. Chelsea Clinton is there. Bartender says, "Hey pal,..."
There's a punchline here. I'm just not able to think of it.
Have to be something like "Hey Pal see anything you like?" then segue to the punchline where the gay guy sees Chelsea and says "what a coincidence Chelsea Clinton is here; it was women like her mother who turned me gay!".
Chelsea stomps out of the bar, and he says, "There goes the neighborhood!"
GM is becoming hysterical about bankruptcy. Yes, sales would decline, but Chapter 11 reorganization will give them flexibility they need to fix many of their problems. They know this and I could understand them being worried, but why do they keep acting like it's the end of the world?
My theory; GM is not only in far worse condition than they are letting on to anyone outside a tight inner circle and has committed criminal fraud hiding that fact. Bankruptcy will expose all the dirty laundry and people will go to jail.
My 88 Dodge Colt is suffering predictable breakdown. Piece of junk. Cars don't last 20 years anymore.
Made by Mitsubishi, which I chose because of their aircraft experience.
And try finding a Zero these days.
AJ Lynch said: Plus the Janps and Asians buy very few of our cars? Why is that?
Duh. The Japanese don't buy American cars because they drive on the left side of the road.
During the post-war occupation and reconstruction it was decided by GHQ to retain Japan's left-driving to discourage the American Auto industry from flooding Japan with American cars.
Ironic, eh?
In the early postwar years, with passenger car production restricted by GHQ, motorcycles and three-wheelers played an enormous part in meeting the demand for motorized vehicles in Japan. In fact the Bank Of Japan didn't think an auto industry was necessary which gave rise to MITI and keiretsu.
GHQ also decreed that Allied vehicles would be rebuilt and repaired by Japanese firms to bootstrap the industry, who carefully studied our work methods and repair techniques, adapting and refining them.
Toyota developed JIT not from studying our auto industry but Piggly Wiggly, another irony.
Every competitive advantage the Japanese learned; we taught them. You might want to Google W.F. Taylor, Frank Gilbreth, and especially W. Edwards Deming.
Stupidly, we did not apply the knowledge to our own industry. The Big 3 crash & burn is way over due and as others have commented they did it to themselves.
BTW-Denso Corp is GM's top supplier, don't fret, the Japanese will take a hit as well.
American vehicles needed to have been built better. I think that is the core of the problem. In 1984 I bought a Chevy truck, no frills, three speed on the column, probably the last one made. No air conditioning. Within 2 years the paint started to fall off. I mean big pieces after a rain. I painted it last summer, and there was no paint on the cab and hood. Some paint left on the bottom parts. I've had to replace the generator, starter and brakes, which was no big deal, and did the work myself. It's been reliable for 148,000 miles. Except for the paint, which limited the resale value, almost immediately.
Next up, I bought a 1998 Chev S-10, and had to replace the clutch after 80,000 miles, again, at 120,000 miles plus some transmission parts. Sometimes you could get it into 4 wheel drive, sometimes you couldn't get it out. Everything broke on the car, and by 1997, it was a piece of rust.
Because I had a 55 mile drive to work, and was closing in on retirement, I spent $8500 on a GEO Metro. Made in Canada it has been a blessing, and is still going strong at 168,000 miles. I have to replace the exhaust system about every 4 years, but do the work myself, so it's relatively inexpensive.
I remember when I got out of the Army in 1968, and my father bought a brand new Dodge truck. The worse piece of crap made. Needed a new engine after only 20,000 miles, and by 60,000 miles was a rusted piece of junk.
That's why Detroit is having problems.
Dang! Make that "I bought a 1989 Chev S-10"
That's why Detroit is having problems.
Quite a while back I heard Phil Condidt (of Boeing) tell a story about transmissions. Apparently the Ford Ranger and Mazda pickup used the same transmissions. Both companies had the exact same specs, but the Ford built transmissions had reliability problems. The engineers tore apart the two transmissions but their precise measuring tools couldn't detect any difference.
After further study they found that the Japanese transmissions were more perfect than the measuring tools could distinguish. This extreme precession was necessary for that particular transmission design.
P.S.
He also said that China told Boeing they would not buy planes unless a lot of the construction took place in China. We would never want to put pressure on foriegn companies who want access to our markets, that's not free trade.
1jpb: Exactly. This Deming page will further illustrate the point. Ford did not seek Deming's advice until 1981, the Japanese had a thirty year head start at that point.
Our auto industry is not competitive because we have not made it so, all of us are responsible, the customer who buys iconic marketing and accepts lesser quality as long as it is "cool".
Management, shareholders, unions and politicans are mutually culpable. They began to see the auto industry as a means to produce wealth and votes; the Milo Minderbinder approach.
When better quality, fuel efficient and/or hotter iconic alternatives were offered the public switched in staggering numbers. Still the Detroit dinosaur lumbered on, adding more overhead baggage and producing cars years behind the imports; unaware or incapable of accepting that the import asteroid was about to render them extinct.
Detroit had a serious heads up in the 70's. Ford responded with the more fuel efficient Taurus-Sable cars of the mid and late 80's. GM and Chrysler plodded on through the morass of too many badges, low quality and Congress grandstanding with unrealistic federal regulation time frames; all larded with executive merit bonuses, dividends and labor benefit packages until they finally reached the edge of the insolvency tar pits.
I have extended family members who will be negatively impacted if GM is forced into bankruptcy, but the cost per unit of management and labor must be reduced to make the industry competitive. They must then address the issue of quality control, CAFE goals and most importantly plant realignment and retooling, the mother of all of money-sucking tar pits on Detroit's horizon. Retooling alone will take 4-5 years. Our pockets are not that deep, soon the taxpayer, if not already, will be tapped out. Then what? Bankruptcy.
Do it now, accept the short term pain, before it becomes a Sisyphean task.
People won't buy a car from a company that is in bankruptcy? Really? Did they not fly American while it was in bankruptcy? That seems a hell of a lot more perilous.
Not really. Once you've made your flight, you've received everything American owes you. If you buy a car from a company in bankruptcy, how can you guarantee a supply of spare parts and service? What about warranties? Ask Peugeot, Fiat, and Alfa Romeo owners what it was like when they abandoned the US market.
To those saying US cars are crap, have you been to an auto show this year? The latest batch of new GM cars, like the Pontiac G8 and Cadillac CTS, are light years ahead of GM's past efforts. Interior quality and design is top notch, GM's powertrains are a good as ever (never slam GM's engineers), and ride & handling is as good as anything out there. I currently own a Lexus, but I'm seriously considering a CTS, it's that good.
"Rice Burning"? Very intelligent journalism there. How ignorant! The American auto companies have had plenty of time to correct their ways, but instead thought it best to rest on their pathetic American laurels. "We're Americans. We practically invented the car so we don't need to be taking advice from any other country's business practices." Typical American mentality. And now look where its gotten you. It's an eat or be eaten world and the American automakers have just been served up with a side of steaming rice.

Diagram that! is the implicit challenge from Gertrude Stein – whose sentences are devilishly devoid of commas.."
74 comments:
I can vividly remember diagramming sentences in 5th grade for Sr. Louise. Good stuff!
Gertrude Stein, one of those incredibly great writers that nobody actually wants to read.
Just remember: There is no there there.
Now, you're ready to impress people at a party.
She's the Frank Zappa of writing. Every musician, and rock fan feels compelled to proclaim that Zappa was a genius, but nobody actually wants to listen to his music.
Proclaiming the greatness of Stein and Zappa proves you're an intellectual.
The titles to his songs are, however, great. I suggest reading the titles and ignoring the songs.
The fact that language is so incoherent the fact that people no longer diagram sentences is due to.
Gertrude Stein gets her new iPhone.
I diagrammed sentences in Catholic school and didn't do it again until a linguistics course in college. They were similar experiences. Very boring, but probably there to give humanities majors the same sense of consistent but trite accomplishment math majors get when they solve problems.
Suck on a comma, Gertrude.
...
--
And going through my university's English program, I never met a single professor who thought Stein was anything other than a stammering retard. She's venerated because she owned the saloon that all the great ex-pats hung out at in Paris. She's the kid everyone pretends to like because her parents are never home and has a fridge stocked with soda and a downstairs with a Super Nintendo AND Sega Genesis.
For a couple years I was an English major -- until I married and started worrying about how I might put food on the table -- and I enjoyed diagramming sentences. It was relaxing work, a lot like working a sudoku puzzle; I didn't find it exciting. I feel sorry for anyone whose life is so dull that diagramming a sentence would qualify as exciting.
Which reminds me of a story: When I was in high school I told my uncle I was going sky diving later that summer (subsequent events conspired to make the sky diving adventure impossible). My uncle asked why my friends and I were going sky diving. I told him it was for the excitement. My uncle, who had jumped out of perfectly good airplanes during the war, replied: "Excitement? When I jumped out of a plane, the guys shooting up at us provided the excitement. The jump itself was peaceful." Everything's relative.
Try again --
Kids are not taught to diagram sentences anymore(adverb), even in the best of schools. That's why young people today can't write worth a damn. They don't know grammar, and they don't know how the parts of speech (What's that?) work together.
It's a shame.
Gertrude Stein stepped off the Oakland trolley
And fell into a void;
She shoulda stayed on the IRT
And got off at toid and toidy toid.
Interesting post. Earlier I was thinking about how sentence diagraming must be used in Siri to breakdown the different permutations of saying the same thing.
New Testament Greek must have been fun written in all capitals with no punctuation and no spaces.
I guess if you want to hear the message, then you will work at it..
oops--was = would
She uses them instead of question marks, though, because she hates them even more!
Being Gertrude Stein, she would prefer a question martha to a question mark anyway, wouldn't she? I'm sure there's a masculine angle that can be teased out of her hatred of commas. It probably has something to do with that little phallic sarif.
Re; Zappa
The titles to his songs are, however, great. I suggest reading the titles and ignoring the songs.
Ditto. Zappa is to rock what the Church Of The SubGenius is to religion.
Commas and question marks are tools, and should be used as needed. While I'm sure it's perfectly feasible to craft a cabinet without a table saw, for instance, not only will the work be more difficult but the end result not nearly as true. An unwillingness to use available tools speaks more to misplaced self-confidence than actual skill.
Erik: enjoyed your comment and agree with most of it--having watched the dude on PBS that works with 19th century tools, I think there is a certain art in using hand tools.. I am guessing you are an outcome guy rather than a process guy :)
You might enjoy this.
A serif could always be misinterpreted as a hanging chad and then LOOK OUT!
Am I the last lover of the semi-colon?
It is a compromise mark. Half comma and half colon; Sort of transpunctuation.
It's tedious putting a question mark where the words have already made it a question. I like a question mark where it transforms the words into a question. I like a working question mark, not a slacker, conventional question mark.
what Trad guy said--the semi-colon may be the last bastion of those that learned three rules of punctuation.
I expected diagraming wasn't being taught when we ended up with slogans like Think Different.
Professor--as a matter of interest, am I to assume that your 1Ls are to take a course in legal writing? I think that is a good thing, but would love to hear your take on it.
I suspect, Professor, that you are not a math major. I can assure you that learning to use the chain rule in calculus is equally exciting as the use of LaPlace transform in differential equations.
Clearly different strokes--albeit with the same outcome.
The older parsing mostly replaced by syntactical analysis.
But interesting little-knwon factoid--Miss Stein and her beloved Alice were....nazi sympathizers! (ie Vichy), at least for some time. Althouse kind of gal.
And Shouting OneNote pretending he knows something about music again. Predictable.
she owned the saloon
Don't you mean salon? or did she own a bar?
Am I the last lover of the semi-colon?
Nope. I use it, albeit sparingly, in fictional narrative. I don't think I've ever used it in dialog. Think about how a sentence with a semicolon would sound...
Carol: the difference between a salon and a bar is probably a function of the clientele--as a matter of preference I prefer saloons over salons. the clientele is more straightforward.
ScottM--I think in the case of a semi-colon it would be a visual thing--agree that using a semicolon on spoken language would not be particularly significant.
Every once and a while when going back to edit, I'll see a couple of sentences that are too long and can be combined down into a single sentence with a semicolon. It's always like finding a little Easter egg. I consciously try not to overdue it, though.
The Alt-tards on ..punctuation. Wow. Deep. Stick to the meth labs and yr favorite occultist books, dreck.
ScottM: IIRC the semi-colon is used to tie together two independent clauses. And is also used to follow a conjunction (eg, however) when followed by another independent clause--and finally used when the author has put forward a string of statements wherein the last one separated by a semicolon from the preceding statements. Works in the written format; however, less so in the the oral form where it would be impossible to discern the difference.
They use the semi-colon a lot in the NBA; it's called traveling.
ricpic: thats a damn good visual--thanks
Scott M. said
"I consciously try not to overdue it, though."
I think spoken language and written language are related. For instance,if I want to add punctuation to a spoken sentence, I might choose to do it this way.
Is this what you mean?
J, you seemed to have lost that old creepy spirit for a while. The insults, racial and anti-semitic slurs just don't have the same bite.
I haven't been able to even excite your usually excitable wratth.
Until now.
I was worried about you. I thought that you might be slipping into the final stages of syphillis, but I see you are in remission.

Shouting Yokel---you're the diseased illiterate derelict here, trash .Not to say congenital liar. And I know perfectly well who youve been chatting with. Yr new queer LDS palsie's messages won't help out when your case goes to court. Comprendes, basura
J: its comprende. Take the infinitive comprendar, to understand. drop the ar ending and replace it with e. that makes it imperative in the second person.
this isnt hard Its the imperative form. does not require an s at the end
Grow up asshole--you are a real piece of shit Concentrate on learning at least one language reasonably well--you havent demonstrated that capability well.
basura is of course spanish for trash--but a more grammatically correct form would be (in formal spanish: tu eres basura. thats a complete sentence.
better hurry with your trash talk J--got a 5:30 tee time and not much time to fuck with you.
I wrote, in an earlier thread about disposing of a family portrait, that we enjoy having our little inheritances around us and that some day, someone would regret the painting was burned.
My wife, whose grandmother skipped out on her marriage to hang with The Bloomsberries, has a photograph of her infant father being bounced on Stein's knee - the imagination can run free when viewing!!
Grandmother was ruined by a fiduciary who pilfered, then margined her Trust, which calumny was revealed in the 1929 Crash.
Which has nothing to do with scanning sentences (that I recall taught by Mrs. Kingdom in Grade 5) and everything to do with anonymous advantage-taking on a Forum.

Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
Ahh J: and your incomprehensible entry responds to what exactly? What is it about the english language that escapes you?
Quickly son--I got a tee time coming up--say something intelligible
RogerJ said:
"J: its comprende. Take the infinitive comprendar, to understand. drop the ar ending and replace it with e. that makes it imperative in the second person."
I believe the verb is comprender, with an "er" in place of an "ar." Therefore, it is:
Yo comprendo,
Tu comprendes,
El, ella, usted comprende.
So J's usage was of the second person familiar.
Drug test time, soon Atards
Today I ran across and English workbook from 1956. I remember it well. I loved diagramming sentences. I love puzzles, diagramming a sentence is just like a puzzle; putting everything in its proper place. I follow family members, many nieces and nephews, their children and grand children on FB. I cringe a lot because most of them say Anyname and I as an object of the preposition. Am I an old fuddy duddy? It's all I can do to keep from correcting them.
Roger J. said...
ah edutcher--you are on to my game--it was great when she leaned over me.
I'm sure she warmed your heart.
Joe--you are absolutely correct--thanks for setting me straight--but isnt the issue the imperative form of comprender?
edutcher: she warmed more than that :)
Just as a matter of curiousity: has anyone here ever actually read a book by Gertrude Stein or known someone who has?.....I think Gertrude was being cool and ironic with that diagramming sentences obervation. In real life, she probably found working a strap on with Ernest infinitely more exciting than diagramming sentences. Although, to be fair, it was probably more fun than making out with Alice B. Toklas.
I never diagrammed one.
Further, just from that sample, I can tell Stein's not that good of a writer.
(Would she have any fame at all today if not for her sexuality?)
(Contra Thomas, I like Zappa and listen to his music voluntarily. The key is that nobody wants to listen to his experimental music. The pop-shaped stuff is fine.)
Stein was an avante-garde type that influenced others, especially Hemingway.
She wrote stuff, but its rightly been forgotten.
Diagramming isn't done because it's not a good analysis.
Open Quirk Greenbaum et all to a random example and try to explain it with diagramming.
I highly recommend that 2000-page book. Take a summer to disabuse yourself of the idea that things are governed by rules that you know.
Utterly at random:
"It is with duration adjuncts that we have greatest freedom to use noun phrase, though for the most part they can be regarded as abbreviated prepositional phrases and can be made more explicit and rather more formal by the introducton of for:
They stayed (for) a while.
They lived (for) several years in Italy.
With or without for, time units can be postposed by round (with years) or through, especially when the reference is habitual:
The Stewarts now stay in Italy { the whole summer through, the whole winter long, the whole year round, all the year round. }
Without a numeral or other quantifier, the for can often not be omitted:
?*He put up the night at a hotel.
But:
He stayed the night at a hotel.
He put up that night at a hotel...."
Their aim is to tease out the real rules. Diagramming doesn't help at all.
Thousands of pages like that.
Gertrude Stein's arrogance about punctuation would carry a bit more weight if she written better prose. Unfortunately it was her writing that was weighty (i.e. ponderous), and her objection to commas was mere bitchiness.
Gertrude Stein + Essay = Leaden Drivel
N.B.
Here's another uncomfortable fact of life that makes feminists crazy: A man can gracefully age from a wit and raconteur into a curmudgeon. Women can't do this. They try to be witty and come off bitchy. Then as they age they morph from bitches into batshit crazy cat collectors. Women have never done wit; they don't get it, never have and probably never will. It's hormones or something. Even women who get paid to be witty crash and burn like the Hindenburg every time they attempt the bon mot. Think I'm off my chump, do you? Just listen to Janeane Garofalo for three minutes without chemical protection. Case closed. (BTW, I wonder how many cats Ms. Garofalo owns now.)
I, too, diagrammed sentence after sentence in junior high. I didn't mind it, but I don't know that I got much out of it, either. It was ninth grade Latin that finally -- for some reason -- brought the parts of speech and how they cooperated, together.
[Please note the important comma.]

Come to think of it, I only wish I could have justified a semi-colon, if only to annoy Mme. Althouse. Alas, grammar wouldn't allow it.
Homeschooling Mom here who made all her kids diagram as part of their grammar instruction. They're teens now, so it's been awhile, but interest was recently renewed when our son's best friend's Mom (who is a H.S. English teacher), as a fun exercise/challenge, diagrammed the first sentence of Dickens Pickwick Papers.
She showed her work to me the next morning in church. Who else can she show it to? I still have it.
If we didn't homeschool I'd want my kids to be in her class. Gotta love teachers who do for fun on the weekend what they do for pay during the week.
Tools are handy. This doesn't mean each tool is useful in every situation. It also doesn't mean that because a tool isn't useful in every situation, it's not useful at all. Learn how to use tools and when to use them (or not), and you'll go far.
I've always enjoyed diagramming sentences. I like puzzles and computer programing; diagramming sentences seems to be part of a similar process.
J keeps saying it's drug test time, but he never tells us what his results were. Of course, it's easy to see why.

"She's the Frank Zappa of writing. Every musician, and rock fan feels compelled to proclaim that Zappa was a genius, but nobody actually wants to listen to his music."
I think Zappa sucks, outside a small body of his early work with the original Mothers of Invention. That said, Zappa's fans are legion and they are fanatical...and they do listen to his music.
I always preferred Captain Beefheart.

I went a little overboard with the basil this year. I have three pots of regular sweet basil and my last trip to the farmer’s market sent me home with lemon basil, purple basil, and Thai basil. Cripes! But seriously, basil is the best. Every summer I make Giada’s Italian Lemonade a few times and last week I made it for the first time this summer with four different kinds of basil. Slap my ass and call me fancy! I also used some of the purple basil when I made Creamy Basil Chicken last night for din-din and look how pretty!
Fresh herbs make everything prettier don’t they? Even though my plants were on the wee side, I used some delicious fresh basil when I made homemade pizza last week too. Yummy!
So basically this post is just an ode to basil. I love it so. Even my hand soap and dish soap are the Mrs. Meyer’s Basil scent. Next basil endeavor will be lemon basil ice cream. Stay tuned!
7 thoughts on “Purple basil = new obsession, basil in general – the love continues”
I must try the lemonade! Great post!
I can’t wait for the ice cream!
Couldn’t agree more!! Basil is wonderful. Now I need to try that lemonade!
LOVE the ode to basil! thanks for sharing
Now I’ll have to look for purple basil at the farmers market!
Have you tried strawberry-basil ice cream?? I think it’s one of my favorite combo’s ever!
I will let you have ALL of the basil…all of the colours, flavours and kinds…you can have it all. Basil is one of the ONLY foods that I absolutely despise and despite your photos looking enticing and scrumptious, they have been despoiled by that hideous green mass of aniseed. Oh, by the way…making it purple DIDN’T FOOL ME AT ALL!

First I have my younger students trace a simple fish template, however my older students usually feel more confident so I have them hand draw out a fish shape. Then they draw an eye and lips if they would like to. Also, students are to draw a "fin" in the corner using any kind of line they would like...straight, curving, wiggly, etc.
Then the fun part... adding patterns. Students draw patterns using markers and/or crayons to fill their entire fish.
The next class we first finish our patterns and make sure we don't forget to color our fin in the corner too! Students then cut out the fish and the fin. I help the younger ones with this next step.
Students cut a curving line into the fish body to create a "gill". We need it to curve away from the mouth.
Then take the front half of the cut body and slide it over the back to overlap. This "pops" out the body. I will staple for the younger kids, however older ones can glue with a dot. Then the fin receives a dot of glue and is slid into this Popped gill to dry.
Lastly students glue the fish onto a piece of 9 x 12" construction paper in whatever color they would like. We just put a dot of glue on the dorsal fin, mouth, and tail. No need for it anywhere else. They can use crayons and markers to create an environment around their fish. As you can see my students can come up with some really awesome patterns. These examples are created by 3rd grade students.
I love this project. Simple 3-d and my students are always so proud of their works. Because of storage space, students nearly always take this project home on the second week after completion. This was a fun way to begin our break.
This project took 2 forty minute classes to complete. Our materials were the following:
1. 9 x 12" white drawing paper
2. 9 x 12" color construction paper
3. Markers
4. Crayons
5. Scissors
6. Glue
7. Pencils and erasers
8. Templates (if you so choose to)

*thanks for all the help yesterday, instagram buddies
(past, not passed...haa haa!)
This is my monthly intention for February. Now that the enchantment that comes with the first few weeks of a new year is fading, it has really started to sink in: I'm without him.
After six years with Tomas, and a couple weeks since 'breaking up', I feel like we are broken up. That's actually the first time I've used that phrase. I haven't officially said we're broken up outloud. I guess I still haven't. Haa haa! (You see why I need this month for mourning?)
I've never done this before, so excuse me if it's all coming out weird. I've crushed on guys, who didn't crush back, and sure, that hurt a bit. I've fallen for guys who sorta fell back, and when it didn't amount to a relationship, felt full-fledged heartbreak. I'm no stranger to heartbreak, but I've never been through this before.
I've been with Tomas for six years, and he's been my constant. He's been my phone calls, my cuddle buddy, the one I share news with first, and...well...'the one' in general.
He's been my one.
...and we didn't work out.
Now what do I do?
It's been hitting me really hard since my grandmother left. I'm just starting to wrap my head around it and I find myself going, "Am I single? I'm alone again, aren't I?" I am without an other.
I miss him terribly. I love him very much, but it was me who ended it. ? ? ? Yeah. It was me who thought it wasn't fair to him for we to be 'us'. He's been wanting so much more from me for such a long time and I...can't. So, on top of feeling alone, I feel guilty, and it's placed me in a FUNK.
I'm allowing myself to mourn this month.
I'm going to grant myself the space, the time, and the silence to heal.
I'm going through a break-up and it feels like a death, but I want to MAKE IT PAST THIS.
Thanks for understanding.
Happy love month!

When I was pregnant with Piper, it was my first pregnancy. Other than the typical first timer fears of “OMG, is this pregnancy going to stick? Is everything all right?” I was okay. I waited the weeks until our first appointment, a little panicky but overall okay. After all, I had no reason to be suspicious. I peed on various tests, watching that test line gradually darken, knowing hormones were kicking in, thankful for the nausea and the boobs that were so freaking sore I couldn’t go without a tight bra.
The second time I got pregnant, I was still nervous. I was excited but okay. Then my temp started dropping and I got a little scared. I stopped temping to avoid the stress. My tests didn’t get darker- at all. I had no nausea, no sore boobs, nothing to tell me everything was okay. Still, I made that appointment, hopeful everything was going to be okay. Then I saw brown on the tissue. I called the doctor, fearful but knowing brown spotting = old blood, and we all know old blood isn’t the kind to be scared of. “Watch for bright red blood and cramping, back pain. Even then, a little spotting isn’t bad, it’s normal.” Luckily, the spotting had ceased. The next morning I had to drop Piper off at school, Paul had to leave early. I was getting her ready and went to the bathroom. There was red on the tissue, and my heart stopped. Still, I had to suck it up, I was in charge of Piper. As I continued the morning routine, I repeatedly went to the bathroom, red, red. I was starting to cramp. I was scared, so scared. Before we left for school, I sent Paul a text saying, “It’s red blood now. I think I’m losing the baby.” I put on Piper’s music in the car and let her sing along while I was deep in thought. How we didn’t somehow die on that trip I’ll never know, my mind was not there at all. I remember walking up to the door, saying hello to the teacher. The whole time thinking, “I’m probably miscarrying and there is nothing we can do about it.” I kissed Piper goodbye and headed to the office. The spotting turned to bleeding. I called our nurse crying. It was the beginning of the end.
“Next time”, I thought, “next time- it there IS a next time- I will go in early for betas. I will stop temping, I will do whatever I can.”
There was a next time. It was a very, very unexpected next time. Still, I did everything right. I kept temping a few days, until it all went haywire and I freaked out and threw it into Paul’s nightstand. I kept taking my vites, I kept testing and seeing the line get darker and darker. Everything was moving as it should. I called my doctor to get my betas done- at 15dpo it was 258. Then, at 17 dpo, it was 817 or something equally high. Things were really good. There was no instance of spotting, not one speck of red or pink. My boobs were hurting, but that was it. I was worried, but not overly, as I had the betas done, right? I was scheduled for an early ultrasound at what should have been 6ish weeks or so. We saw two gestational sacs, one with a yolk sac. It was measuring a few days small, which isn’t a big deal- I have a tilted uterus. I went back, and it had grown but not that much. And well… you know how it turned out.
I’m going over all this because I am not sure what I have left to do. We did the “wait and see” approach, and it didn’t help. We did the cautionary way, and nothing helped. Everything was looking great this last time. We had no reason to be suspicious. Now, we have no safety nets. I have nothing to turn to in order to ease my fears. Betas have proven nothing is concrete, and early scans are just a window to a chain of events that will break your heart.
Where do you turn when you have no more options left to keep you sane? I have two options for the next time- if there is a next time, and I’m not sure there will be-, I can just be an outright fucking mess from that first positive test until I get to 14 weeks (or the baby is born, depending on what we determine the issue was) , or I can just let go and do whatever I can personally (baby aspirin and whatever else is an option) to ensure I will feel no guilt should something happen again, but otherwise just have faith.
Gotta be honest, neither one of those plans sound particularly awesome. I’m trying so hard to be optimistic, and happy that it appears I am ovulating today or ovulated yesterday (based on cervical mucous and opks and ovulation pain), which means the hcg is low enough to ovulate. I’m working really hard at being hopeful that the next pregnancy will be the success and thus, the last. But right now I am being inundated with pregnancy news. Left and right people are announcing pregnancies, and I am foolishly taking joy in being happy that I have an appointment on Tuesday for a scan to make sure my body expelled the last of the baby I lost. It all seems so unfair when I look at it that way. They get to be happy knowing they have no reason to be afraid. I envy them. I wish so badly that I could get that feeling back, that feeling of being scared for the future, but knowing deep down the odds are great that all will be well. At least, for me, the odds didn’t make one spit of difference. I was still the odd loss out. I know no matter what, I am going to be absolutely terrified. I don’t know if I will be able to experience a pregnancy without fear now. I’m terrified right now, and there is no reason- no pregnancy to worry about.
I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I’m trying so hard to not try to envision it as a total black hole of despair and fear. Very hard.

Fr. Drew Christiansen, SJ, editor in chief of America, reports on his visit, along with a small group of Catholic press representatives, with President Obama this morning (Thurs., July 2) at the White House. (Fr. Christiansen is pictured in the photo at the far left of the table.) The quotes are taken from the official White House transcript.
In a wide-ranging interview with Catholic editors and religion reporters in advance of his July 11 meeting with Pope Benedict XVI, President Barack Obama expressed his admiration for Catholic social teaching and the quality of its social action. He voiced particular gratitude to the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, the Catholic Campaign for Human Development and the Catholic parishes of southside Chicago where he first worked as a community organizer in the 1980s.
“Cardinal Bernardin was strongly pro-life,” the president reported, “never shrank from speaking about that issue, but was very consistent in taling about a seamless garment and a range of issues that were part and parcel of what he considered will meet with Pope Benedict following a meeting of G-8 leaders in L’Aquila, Italy, whose agenda with the G-20 last April. The U.S. has committed $100 billion to the IMF to cushion the effects of the global economic recession on the world’s poor. The president also plans to double the U.S. contribution to world food security and direct U.S. development aid to poor countries to agricultural development for the sake of food self-sufficiency. He also intends to press other wealthy nations for matching contributions to international food security as well.
On his own current religious practice, President Obama allowed that he and the First Lady have still to settle on membership in a local church. He acknowledged rumors that they were very comfortable with the small congregation at Camp David, the president’s weekend retreat in Catoctin, Md., but that they are still looking for a local congregation in Washington. He confessed that the controversies over the Reverend Jeremiah Wright during last fall’s election campaign had taught them both that as public figures they could be too easily associated with the views of a particular pastor or congregation. In addition, they have learned that the security arrangements associated with a president’s movement anywhere creates a heavy burden on any congregation they attend. They hope to settle on a congregation this fall.
In the meantime, the president leans on a group of pastors and religious advisors who provided pastoral support during his campaign for the presidency, including some Catholics, and he begins his day with reflection on a devotional sent to him each morning on his Blackberry by Rev. Joshua DuBois, the director of the White House Office for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnership.

Practicing What We Teach
Canon law allows the diocesan bishop to impose taxes, sometimes called diocesan assessments, quotas, mandatory targets or fees, on parishes. Although dioceses in the United States increasingly rely upon voluntary annual appeals, a survey in 2001 by the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings in Montana found that 73 of the 96 responding dioceses collected mandatory taxes from parishes to meet diocesan needs.
Catholic social teaching provides some clear guidance about how these taxes should be collected. In Mater et Magistra (1961), Pope John XXIII wrote that in a system of taxation based on justice and equity it is fundamental that the burdens be proportioned to the capacity of the people contributing. In their 1986 pastoral letter on the U.S. economy, the American bishops explicity endorsed a progressive tax scheme based on assessment according to ability to pay as a prime necessity for basic justice.
Given such clear guidance from Catholic social teaching and their own pastoral letter of 1986, the bishops might well be expected to employ progressive tax rates in their dioceses. But that is far from being the case.
A survey of diocesan taxing practices conducted in 2003 at Notre Dame Law School shows that bishops who impose diocesan taxes in the United States use flat tax rates almost four times more frequently than progressive rates. Of the 73 dioceses that describe themselves as imposing diocesan taxes, six dioceses do not base their diocesan taxes on income at all. Only 14 diocesesor less than 20 percentreported using progressive tax rates. The remaining 53 diocesesan overwhelming majority of dioceses that report imposing a taxmention only flat rates in describing their diocesan taxes. Stated another way, those flat-rate dioceses outnumber the 14 dioceses using progressive rates for a diocesan tax by a ratio of almost four to one.
By contrast, the federal income tax in the United States uses a progressive system, in which tax rates increase as income increases. For example, taxpayers might pay a 10 percent tax on the first $10,000 of income, 15 percent on the next $20,000 and 25 percent on all income in excess of $30,000. Under a flat tax, on the other hand, the same tax rate, say 20 percent, would apply to all taxable income. Thus, for example, a taxpayer who earned $10,000 would pay $2,000 in tax, while a taxpayer with $1,000,000 in income would owe $200,000 in tax. Although both tax collections and actual spending determine whether a tax system redistributes economic resources from the rich to the poor, progressive rates further such a redistribution.
While urging the redistribution of economic wealth in the U.S., the bishops in 1986 called on the government to use three principles to evaluate the public tax system and its effect on the poor. First, the tax system should raise adequate revenues to pay for society’s needs, especially the obligation to meet the poor’s basic necessities. Second, the system should not require families below the official poverty line to pay income taxes. Third, the tax system should use a progressive structure so that those taxpayers who enjoy relatively greater financial resources pay taxes at a higher rate. The bishops explicitly commented that a progressive tax system would reduce the severe inequalities of income and wealth in the United States.
In the same pastoral letter, the bishops stressed their belief and teaching that all the moral principles that govern the just operation of any economic endeavor apply to the church and its agencies and institutions and articulated the need for the church to model exemplary behavior. In view of this, the bishops would do well to follow their own counsel. Both collectively and individually, they should review their diocesan tax policies and practices to determine whether they flow from the ethical moral vision articulated in their pastoral letter. Using their teachings about national tax policy as a general guide, diocesan taxes under canon law should therefore: (1) raise adequate revenues to fund the diocese’s needs, including the obligations to assist the poor in the diocese, poorer parishes in the diocese, other dioceses, and the Apostolic See; (2) exempt poorer parishes from the tax (or at least subject them to lower tax rates than richer parishes); and (3) use progressive rates so that those parishes and other taxable entities enjoying relatively greater financial resources pay at a higher tax rate.
Moreover, distributive justice challenges the bishops to adopt diocesan tax practices that in both fact and appearance seek to ensure that poorer parishes can adequately support priests and ministers, build and maintain churches and schools, and assist the poor and vulnerable in their communities. Flat tax rates offer simplicity, but they do not redistribute economic resources. Current diocesan programs to support parishes in need may redistribute parish resources as well as progressive tax rates would. Nonetheless, by either completely exempting poorer parishes from diocesan taxes or reducing the tax rates on such parishes and raising the tax rates on more affluent parishes, the bishops in the United States can rather easily adopt progressive rates with little, if any, loss in overall revenue to the diocese.
The bishops should adopt progressive tax rates and otherwise change their policies and practices regarding diocesan taxes under canon law to follow more closely the commitment to distributive justice in Catholic social teaching. To facilitate this process, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops should consider undertaking a project that would draft one or more model progressive diocesan tax systems for diocesan bishops to bring back to their dioceses for consultation and possible implementation. As an added benefit, such reforms in diocesan tax policies would enable the bishops to speak more authentically on federal income tax issues, and especially to oppose the periodically recurring efforts to move to a flat federal income tax.
The Christian emphasis on distributive justice goes back well beyond current church teaching. Jesus and his disciples practiced what Jesus preached. John’s Gospel reports that they kept a common purse out of which the group met their own needs and gave amounts to the poor (Jn 12:6, 13:29). In the Acts of the Apostles, St. Luke explains the practices used by the early Christians to support the church and the poor within the community (Acts 4:32-37). In the First Letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul describes how one body of believers might lend assistance to another group (1 Cor 16:1-4). In the Second Letter to the Corinthians, Paul also urges the faithful to follow the example of the churches of Macedonia, which voluntarily gave according to their means, [and] beyond their means, spontaneously, and begged us insistently for the favor of taking part in the service to the holy ones (2 Cor 8:3-4).
The payment of diocesan taxes allows a parish to help its diocese and the universal church to build the kingdom of God here on earth. In the closing sentence of their letter on the U.S. economy, the bishops wrote: Love implies concern for allespecially the poorand a continued search for those social and economic structures that permit everyone to share in a community that is part of a redeemed creation. Using progressive rates to impose diocesan taxes would better enable the U.S. bishops to practice what the Gospel, the universal church and they themselves teach.

- Wood windows: Many consider wood windows to be the most visually appealing. The natural beauty of wood is difficult to reproduce. They are often chosen for their strength, ability to be painted or stained, and their insulating qualities. Wood will not conduct heat or cold as easily, thereby providing good insulation against hot summer or cold winter days.
- Vinyl, Aluminum, or Wood Clad windows: These windows offer homeowners the option of having the benefits of one kind of window (such as the durability of vinyl or the natural beauty of wood) with the appearance of another. The window will can be made out of the product of your choice, but will be capped with a finish that appears to be another product.

Avi second time the other night. In the middle of telling a story, I had that awful feeling in the pit of my stomach that I had just told him that same story a week ago. Oops!! I recognize I’m very lucky, but I desperately need some help keeping track of potential keepers?
Raining Men
Dear Raining Men:
Every girl should be so lucky to have a swarm of men — nay, a veritable entourage! — buzzing about her. And, as you’ve identified, with great opportunity comes great challenge.
Mistakes can be made whether you’re dating a pair of men, or what Adele calls a “Match.com Minyan.” You not only have to worry about putting your best foot forward, but also keeping that foot out of your mouth. Facts, details, anecdotes can become the bane of your existence if you don’t treat the business of dating like a, well, business.
Allocate a little brain power to what Avi calls “date management.” Go high-tech with a spreadsheet or even your phone’s contact-tracking capabilities to map out critical details. Or keep it low-tech with every girl’s favorite tool: the little black book.
You’ll find peace of mind by keeping a few mundane details at your fingertips. It’s really the mundane you want to capture, unless you’re a total hussy and can’t recall which base you’ve rounded with whom without having to document when, where, and how.
So what to track? Consider any or all of the following:
Siblings/Parents (How many of each? Where do they live?)
Past date details (Where did you go? Who paid?)
Job/Company name/College
Faith (Is he conservative, reform, or other? Does he fast on Yom Kippur?)
Passions (What’s his top hobby? What countries has he visited?)
Great embarrassment also comes from repeating stories about yourself. Things could get sticky – assuming that he knows something about you when you haven’t told him or even giving an old story an embellished encore. So be sure to note which major stories and details you’ve shared with him too.
One strategy that Avi uses with his first dates is to make sure to cover family, job and world travels before the check hits the table. That way, he can treat all future conversations as informed about his personal life.
Also, consider creating a post-date checklist to review before future dates.
Too much to handle? Then maybe the big leagues aren’t for you and you should scale down your efforts to give your dating life the love and attention it deserves. Whether you’re handling your men as individuals or looking for the wholesale discount, remember that your best bet is to just be yourself. With that strategy, you’ll hit a home run every time.
Livin’ and Lovin’,
Avi and Adele

I had to do it for one of my classes..psych maybe? Or else I wouldn't have done it. Maybe it's the Scorpio in us Bridget?
We're everything lolWe're everything lol
I had trouble deciding, too. When I wasn't sure, I asked DH what he sees me do most often! Actually it was an interesting discussion, to see how he sees me.
You all have much more interesting lives than I do. Enjoy your Fourth!

I am supposed to be going over to Rich's for bbq later. I'm taking Mom & my brother is already there. It's kinda funny that Tim is over there 3-4 times a week, but he's only been to my apartment once since I moved in over a month ago. He doesn't act angry or disappointed, but he's not coming over to visit. I kinda chuckle to myself and think, "yeah, I thought my brother and I were close but really he was using me to see Rich."
The reality is he's been so busy, and Rich's house is on the way to/from the people he works with, plus all his tools are there. By the time he's done for the day, he just wants to go home and relax.The reality is he's been so busy, and Rich's house is on the way to/from the people he works with, plus all his tools are there.

I was 1/2 afraid I'd get slammed on facebook, maybe even lose some friends, but I found (through a liberal mamas group I'm in on FB)
this article comparing right-wing ideals regarding liberty to southern aristocracy. I found it very interesting and enlightening.
It starts out.

and yes I'm partying it up here. So far I have gone online, talked to my mom on the phone and watched Hangover II. I think that there is another movie in the near future and dinner. And I will probably force myself to go in the basement and put in a bit of time on the elliptical. Even the dogs don't want to be outside today!
Someone stole my credit card number and has been putting small charges on it for the past few days. I didn't find out about it until they tried to buy a couple of plane tickets from Montreal to London today. We only have one credit card, and a ton of my bills and services are deducted through it, so it's going to be a huge pain going without it for the next few days and then making all of the calls to change it. I am going to have to update at least 20 different sites, I think.
On the up side, both twins said "This is the best day of my entire life" at the parade today.
Oh, L, what a nightmare! Will the bank reimburse you for the stolen charges?
However, yet another fantastic siggy pic from you. Love it.
Me (38) DH (45) & furbabies * m/c 7/08 4/12 11/12
Oh man, L! That sucks! What's with all the robbery around here?
My cousin called me today to see if we wanted to come to her town and go to the fair and I was thinking that sounded like about the most miserable thing ever in 100 plus weather! So I invited her and her husband to come here and go out on our pontoon with us. She was more than happy to change plans! Well when we all got on the boat the engine was acting awfully strange and I could see her and her husband exhanging looks like they were wondering what they got themselves into. When dbf finally got the boat started we just went out a little ways so that we were close to the shore just in case. It was so hot we all ended up jumping in the water and swam for about 3 hours! It was so fun. We never swim in our lake because the bottom is so mushy and just feels nasty on our feet. But with the lifejackets on it's so easy to float and keep your feet up. I couldn't believe how brave Kai was being. He is very, very nervous in the water and will not go past his waist. Even if I take him deeper he clings to me. Today he was all over the place. I'm so proud of him!
Awww! Way to go Kai!!!
I just hung out at Rich's with the kids. Conner got us all with the hose. I tried to get Conner to dance in the rain with me, but he just kept looking at me like I was crazy. Rich, unfortunately, tried being playful and chased me around a bit and then kept hugging/hanging all over me. I finally had to say, "I don't feel like cuddling" and then he pouted for nearly an hour. He did snap at Conner about something too. I finally asked him if he wanted me to leave. He apologized and then acted normal.
I felt bad, but come on.
Ugh, Chrissy. I can see how that would be annoying. In some ways, it seems, he acts like a child. And I'm sure you want to be able to go over and hang out with your family without having to worry about that.
I do feel bad for him. I know what it's like to love someone like that that doesn't love you back. It sucks. In fact, our roles were reversed 18 years ago. I keep telling him I can't help how I feel. If I could just make myself feel in love with him, I would because it would be easier for everyone.
So back to that test, I don't see how the results can be accurate if so many of us feel we could go one way or another. I mean, I feel like it would depend on the day for lots of those questions.
And I feel bad for Rich too, Chrissy but not in a way that I think you aren't doing exactly what you need to be doing. I have been on both ends of that as well. And both ends are really difficult.
Tell me if this in not common sense? When you are holding a baby who sees his mama and begins to cry for her, what do you do? Because everyone I know brings the baby to me but dbf actually puts him down and says, "Go to mama then." And poor Sawyer just stands there crying until I come to him! I ask him why do you just put him down like that? And he says, "He doesn't want me. He wants you." I'm like DUDE! Look around you and tell me you don't notice what other people do when he cries for me? He is lucky that he spared himself by saying, "Ok, i see what you mean."
Sometimes he acts like this is his first child, I swear he is even more clueless than he was with Savana.
Omg, the men in here!
I'm sorry, guys.I'm sorry, guys.

OMG Sawyer I woke up to Sawyer actually kissing me on the lips this morning! He such a little doll.
That is really sweet, Bridget! My sweet little Cash has turned in to a right little bully lately! He fights with Travis now, and I think that makes him think he can fight with anyone. He has a cousin who is 5 months younger than he is and he likes to rugby tackle her to the ground. Also, when we go to play groups, he pushes other kids, tries to hit them and has even grabbed a handful of hair. I've always had to watch him like a hawk any how because he's a risk taker, but now I watch him because of how he is with the other kids. All I can do is to stop him from doing whatever he's doing and in a stern voice say something, "No, we don't hit, etc." But I sure wish he'd get over this phase quickly!
I'm going out tomorrow night with the yummy mummies. As time has gone one, I've got to know them better and I actually like most of them now!
Speaking of housework.....
I have to say that I find this true in my home. DH is a decently happy guy and we either do household chores 50/50 or if anything, he does more than I do.
Sawyer.Sawyer.
Cash! lol...later, it'll be funny. When he's a grown-up nice young man you can make his friends laugh at what a little bully he was. I'm sure he'll outgrow it.Cash! lol...later, it'll be funny.

C. woke up this morning and said, "Mom, I learned a new F word--Fireworks!"
Both of the twins told me it was the best day ever. R. told me "I'll remember this forever!" They all loved the fireworks. Even before then, at the parade, they were ecstatic. They were non-stop bouncing all day.!

OK so there's like a 1% chance I'm preggo but I need to know before I start BCP (to regulate cycles). Now I'm not sure if I'm a nut job or what but I've been seriously freaking out thinking that I am in fact preggo and might be imagining false symptoms (Swollen ankles, sore bbs, nausea...)
SO- I'm struck with sudden urge of NEED TO KNOW NOW and run to WM and get a 3pk of FR on my lunch hour. Come back to work and POAS. Nothing. 3 minutes later, nothing. Not even the first line. Blank screen. 8 minutes, still nothing. 15 minutes later still a blank screen so I bust 'er open and (I've never done that before, fyi) and the stick inside has a big pink blurry blob. No discernible lines whatsoever. Everything was soaked, so I know pee wasn't the issue.
Now I'll wait till tomorrow am to POAS again. But ****. I'M SO MAD!!! Had to share. Anyone else get a junk FR?
History:
Mirena removed March 2nd. Bled for 2-3 days after, with cramping. Expected I guess.
Nothing even resembling a cycle...
DTD June 17th (Fathers day, lol!)
AF or at least flow for 3 days, 1 week later (Last week of June)

Do you ever think about living forever? I have no personal desire to live out all of eternity in this body….but there is a desire to maintain some history of consciousness that can be passed on and shared across generations.
Ben Goertzel is getting to the vast unknown of infinite consciousness in his recent post on Mind Uploading:
“I don’t know if we will ever solve the “hard problem of consciousness”, i.e. the problem of rigorously connecting subjective experiences with physical structures and dynamics. My gut feel is that this will require the invention of some new discipline going beyond contemporary science, synthesizing aspects of empirical/theoretical science with aspects of spiritual traditions and contemplative metaphysics like that of the medieval Buddhist logicians. I gave a talk on this at the 2011 Asia Consciousness Festival.”
Mind Uploading connects the human spirit to the world of digital interfaces directly and it makes us question ideas like reincarnation where some karmic exchange is passed from death into new life. Uploading aspects of consciousness implies that your mind can then be accessed and used by others, perhaps even downloaded into a new host. Embodied intelligence can then take infinite new forms if the receptors and information retain their integrity. Research on reincarnation suggests a direct mind upload from one consciousness to another complete with habits, scars and physical connections.
The interesting future of AGI promises deep interconnection beyond individual access to any information – AGI taps into the collective desire to create new forms of awareness. Quantum computers, doping silicates and graphene nano & biochemistry experiments will yield all types of life over the next decades. We have just started to see the future and there is some interesting terrain and potentially scary monsters ahead.
The series Dollhouse (click the GIF for animation) showed personalities and minds stored in drives that were mixed and implanted into other humans. “Disposable humans” are a trend that should scare us, whether it’s our homeless, our foster kids and runaway youth, the lost and displaced among us who are often invisible and do disappear. Portable minds and population control dance a very close line in Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse, creating a 2 season exploration of what could happen if we let individual ambition, fear and control dictate our ability to work together. Emergence has dangerous consequences for us and we must expect big shifts in our way of life as we go through this bumpy evolution.
I am optimistic for the future of alternate intelligences as complimentary to our own, only because I have dedicated my work to building healthy bonds between humans and the rest of the intelligent universe to create the new science that Ben Goertzel suggests. I wrote a series for families on this topic with my husband (ManorMeta) and will continue to advocate for stories that promote symbiotic relationships between the human spirit and the emergent newness we are collectively creating.
I have spent the last nine months building EDDEFY with a team of brilliant scientists, designers and futurists because we saw the need to connect the dots in human learning & binding insight. People put objects, concepts, ideas together in creative ways that we have not yet been fully able to emulate with computing systems and over time we will begin to see the patterns in human binding, the context betweens the lines of content in our daily lives. The narratives that come between us and comprehending the choices we make are a tough nut to crack in the quest to create AGI and map the programming of human consciousness. I believe we can solve these contextual puzzles using great tools like EDDEFY to understand how humans put together their thoughts and over time learning how we connect the dots.
There are lots of leaders out there who may have tools to help you program yourself and fine-tune your abilities while embodied in this human reader now finishing a blog post. I am interested in creating the toolkit, bringing together the tools and making educational technology available and easy to use for anyone and everyone on this planet. I do not want to see us become a culture where “disposable people” are ignored, abused or destroyed. What kind of future do you want for the humans?

Cliff Bleszinski Praises Sony, Criticises Microsoft
Among other things, Cliff Bleszinski is known for creating one of Xbox 360′s biggest franchises – Gears of War. In addition, he was the figurehead at Epic Games, the studio responsible for the Unreal Engine 3, which had big problems with the PS3 in its early days. Even so, it seems like Bleszinski is far more pleased with Sony than Microsoft these days.

The Illusion of Choice
If anything has become apparent to me this year, it is that gamers have developed the need, or the want, for choice in the video games they play. Choices, in video games, are usually made in the form of speech options (e.g. Mass Effect 3), choosing whether to go via the roof or along the streets (e.g. Gears of War 2), or simply just how you approach and complete an objective (e.g. Crysis 2). I recently finished The Walking Dead: The Game and it got me thinking, why do we want choice?
A lot of video games try to tell a story. They tell us this story not by showing us, but putting us in the middle of it. We don’t just see countless Nazi’s getting killed by a bunch of soldiers in a WW2 setting, we ARE one (sometimes the whole bunch) of those soldiers killing countless Nazi’s. Although gamers are, essentially, being told a story, we end up wanting to control how that story ends, and everything in between. When developers let us choose, we feel like we are controlling how that story ends. But are we?
What happened with Mass Effect 3′s ending is one great example of gamers wanting control. Throughout 3 games, gamers made hard choices relating to Commander Shepard’s life and mission. When it finally came time to choose the end to Shepard’s story, many fans weren’t happy with the endings Bioware gave Shepard. There was consumer backlash, and you know what followed. Gamers were given a few choices at the end of Mass Effect 3 and some didn’t like any of them. This is the risk with trying to give gamers control of the story. Would there have been backlash if Bioware didn’t allow players to control Shepard’s actions? Probably not, but because players had control through 3 games, they became attached to Shepard. The only reason the backlash occured was because consumers were given the illusion of choice.
Choice doesn’t just come from speech options. Spec Ops: The Line took gamers on a journey and also presented them with choices. These choices weren’t about controlling the narrative of the game, however, they were moral choices. Do you save some innocent civilians or save a military officer who says he has valuable information? These choices didn’t change the narrative completely, but still gave gamers control of certain situations- an illusion of choice.
So what’s better, the illusion of choice via speech options or the illusion of choice via actions that won’t necessarily effect the outcome of the story? How about both? The Walking Dead: The Game does a great job of giving players choice, while still controlling how the overarching narrative flows. It presents both moral choices, and narrative choices that can ultimately lead to whether or not someone lives or dies. But, once again, we are presented with the illusion of choice. Throughout The Walking Dead, you can make decisions that effect certain people or things, but there are several key moments you don’t have control of. For instance, you can’t actually change who survives at the end of the game. Furthermore, there are several parts in the game, no spoilers, where people you save are going to die anyway.
Choice, being an illusion, can fail. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one example of how choice did not work. Reckoning had speech options, but few, actually no, options actually changed anything. They were basically just there so you could build your character to be a nice person, or angry person, but it didn’t have any effect on how people reacted to you long term. In this case, the illusion of choice becomes a let down. The only reason it was there was to try to make gamers think they were actually doing something. Another way in which choices fail is when you think your character is going to say something one way, but instead they say it in other way. This isn’t so much a big deal in most games, but in The Walking Dead, where characters remember how you speak to them, it is important. Once, I thought I was going to say something good about something, but the response came out sarcastically. To further improve the effectiveness of speech relate choice, maybe developers could include emotional reactions along with speech choices.
Choice, or the illusion of it, is something gamers want. We want choice so we can feel like we are in control, but, just like real illusions, some might not be as foolproof as others. So why would developers want to take the risk of tricking gamers into thinking they have control? It comes down to a couple of things, the first being attachment. When you make choices about a character’s life, you tend to grow more attached to them- that’s how video games work. So if developers give gamers plenty of choices to make, surrounding a character, they will grow more fond of them. This could lead to a sequel, which leads to more choices, which leads to a sequel, etc.
The second reason is replay value. Think about it, if you finish a game with choices you might want to go back and play through the game again with some different choices. This keeps you immersed in the game and could even lead to the possibility that you might buy a piece of DLC farther down the track.
The final, and maybe the most far-fetched, reason is discussion. In a game where choices are to be made, chances are someone you talk to will have made a different choice to you. This sparks discussion. What was the right choice? Why did you choose that option? Questions like these will appear not only in the real world, but on internet forums and social media. That means the game is getting more publicity and is being seen and heard by more people. It may even lead to the purchase of a few extra copies. Of course, a good game without choices will also cause this.
As story telling in games starts to improve, I think more developers will find ways to add choice and player control into their games. The tricky part will be creating a story and options that give the player the greatest illusion of choice or control. If players really feel like they are changing events and contributing to the outcome of the story, the risk and illusion of choice was successful. If players can see through the illusion, it might take away from the experience. Choice is a great thing to happen to video games, but developers should be careful to choose which illusion is best for them and their game.

“Industries Fear the Ripple Effects of Proposed Postal Service Cuts” – Was the title of the article in by Ron Nixon in the New York Times yesterday. It is a good statement of some of the key issues that are being taken up starting this week in Washington. All sides are lined up to help shape the final outcome. Today ,CCN Money has picked up the story as well. It seems that all eyes are on Congress as they take up the issue of “postal reform.” All this while all the ears are on the Supreme Court as they take up the issue of ‘Obamacare.’ We certainly do live in interesting times. As the pace of change and disruption our world picks up we must expect many more battles in the future to go along with these two.
Congress has begun work on their vision for Postal Reform, if reform is what they really have in mind. All of the various constituencies are lined up on both sides of the issue. Some want more, and others want the USPS to do less. On the plus side are the wine and beer lobbies that want to be able to use the USPS to ship their products, something the USPS is prohibited from doing by law. On the negative side the insurance and banking industries are lined up to ensure that the USPS not move into their fields, as some in Congress has suggested they do to create more revenues.
Like the newspaper business which is also undergoing its own transformation, the USPS is a huge enterprise that employees nearly 600,000. Beyond that the entire direct marketing field, including mailing companies, printers and direct marketers employees over 10 times that amount. This is a big deal, and we need to get it right. As was noted in the article the field supports over $1 trillion in annual economic activity. It helped to put both of my sons through college, so it is still dear to me.
Nearly every business relies on the post office to deliver packages, advertise services and send out bills. This postal supply chain supports millions of American jobs in fields as diverse as banking, agriculture, media and manufacturing. This is an urgent issue since the USPS is losing nearly $36 million a day. As volumes of mail have decreased with former users now going to digital methods of delivery. Even the USPS has said that it does not expect to get those missing volumes back in the future.
The USPS is also saddled with a Congressional mandate to pre-fund future retirements, the only government agency to have to do so, to the tune of $5.5 billion. Relief from this mandate would cut the shortfall in half. A sign that this is a big deal is the nearly $300 million spent over the last three year by those lobbying on all sides of this issue – both the USPS employee unions and industries who work in the direct marketing field.
Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has proposed closing half of the post offices, approximately 3700 and shutting half of the mail processing centers, 250 there. Both changes, along with stopping Saturday delivery, would also help to bring down the shortfall. In a world that has gotten to email and instant messaging for time vital business and personal communications, there would seem to be some wiggle room for printed mail – derisively called ‘snail mail.’ A big question is how fast do we need to be, especially if we want to price reduction, or at least fewer price increases. And yes, the USPS is also asking for a 50 cent first class stamp.
Postmaster General Donahoe said in prepared testimony. “If Postal Service were a private company, we would be engaged in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.” The Senate is beginning the process now, and the House will begin deliberations, probably next month. A key deadline for consideration is May 15, when a moratorium on closing postal facilities will expire.
Currently under consideration is a bill that passed a Senate committee in November that would tap the overpayment of the future retirement benefits, currently at $10.9 billion to pay down postal service debt (to the U.S. Treasury) and use up to $2 billion for incentives to get a number of long term employees to retire. The USPS has also planned to open its own health care for employees in hopes of cutting their costs, but there is pretty widespread opposition to that from Congress and the employees.
The USPS is a legacy system with a long history. Like so many of our other ‘legacy’ systems, including newspapers, they are in deep trouble with the change in the economy in our broadening digital age. Change is great for some, though it sucks for others. I live in both worlds, and yes, I still want things the way they used to be. The question is how much am I willing to pay to have that. We make those choices each day, and we are making those choices now regarding our postal system.
In the face of the current situation I have to applaud Postmaster General Donahoe and his staff, though that is a strange position for me. I prospered under the USPS, and endured a lot of petty regulations as well. They clearly understand where they are today, where the world is going, and have surfaced a plan that will help them to move forward under their current legal and financial burdens. Congress has the keys to open doors for them to endure and preserve the current levels of service many still desire. They also have the keys to the vault and say no more. I compliment the PG for a real and thoughtful plan, and I hope our elected officials will make the right choices. In the face of the coming elections later this year – this should prove to be good theater, and maybe even good politics.

Antonio Lotti: A Biography
Early Years
Antonio Pasqualin Lotti was born on 5th January 1667 in Venice. (The Venetian year started on 1st March, so the local year was actually 1666.) He was baptised on 25th January in the church of S. Marina, where his parents, Matteo Lotti and Marina Gasparin, had been married in 1662. Matteo was employed as the Hofkapellmeister at Hanover from 1665 to 1679, so it had been erroneously assumed that Antonio had been born in Hanover. Antonio had a two younger siblings: a brother, Francesco, (1672 - 1761); and a sister, Maria Melusina, born in 1673. Francesco became a Ragioniere (accountant) to the Collegio dei Savi (College of the Elders) of the Venetian Republic. Maria married a musician in Hanover. In 1683, at the age of 16, Antonio studied with Giovanni Legrenzi (1626 - 1690).
In 1687, he started singing at the Cappella Ducale di San Marco. That year, he was also one of the first to enrol the Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia, a form of musicians' benevolent society, founded on 25 Nov 1687. On 30 May 1689, he drew a salary of 100 ducats for the position of cantor di contralto. On 6th August 1690, he was nominated as assistant organist (auito organista), and paid an extra 30 ducats for this work. He was unanimously elected to the post of 2nd organist (organista del 2 organo) on 31st May 1692. In 1693, his first opera, Il trionfo dell'innocenza, was staged at the Teatro San Angelo.
Twenty of his operas were performed in Venice over the next 24 years, by which time his operatic work had attracted the attention of the Elector of Saxony, Friedrich Augustus I (1670 - 1733) (confusingly known as Augustus II “the strong”).
From 1697 to 1707, he was also maestro di cappella of the Scuola dello Spirito Santo.
On 22nd July 1698, Lotti received 50 ducats from the Procuratoria di San Marco for producing a book which contained one a cappella mass.
On 17th August 1704, he made a request to take the position of first organist, “with the salary and benefits to enjoy it,” following the death of Giacomo Filippo Spada (c.1640 - 1704). He was voted in by 13 votes to 1 against.
Basilica San Marco, Venice
In 1705, Lotti had a collection of madrigals published: Duetti, terzetti e madrigali a piu voci, by the Venetian printer Antonio Bortoli. The collection was dedicated to the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I (1640 - 1705), who sponsored the publication, but unfortunately died while the pages were still being printed. Only when Leopold's successor agreed to pay the printer was the printing completed. A manuscript of the music survives in Lotti's hand, dated 1703. The music was generally given a favourable reception, except for an acrid critique, entitled Lettera familiare d’un accademico filarmonico. The letter was anonymous, but it has long been thought to be by Benedetto Marcello (1686 - 1739), a former pupil of Lotti's. Marcello's pamphlet was never published, as the result of some 'intervention'. The collection is Lotti's only work to be published in his lifetime. Works from the collection are available from Ancient Groove Music here.
In 1711, he travelled to Novara to attend a festival on 14th June, at which he provided some compositions.
On 12 February 1714, he married the soprano, Santa Stella Scarabelli (c. 1686 - 1759), who was from Bologna. In her will, she acknowledged the existence of a daughter, Lucrezia Maria Basadonna, who was a nun, and had been fathered by another man before she married Lotti. Santa Stella's dowry was 18,600 ducats. They lived in Calle dei Fabbri, in the parish of S. Geminiano, and also had a villa in the Veneto at Strà.
Dresden
After an offer of employment by the Elector of Saxony, Friedrich Augustus I, Lotti was granted a leave of absence by the procurators of the Basilica San Marco on 17th July 1717, and he left for Dresden on 5th September 1717 with his wife and a band of Italian musicians, including the castrato Senesino (1686 - 1758). The librettist Antonio Maria Luchini also accompanied them.
Much of Lotti's concertante sacred music, written in Venice, survives now in Dresden or in other locations as a result of his time there. His pupil, Jan Dismas Zelenka was particularly important in preserving Lotti's music. These comprise individual Kyries, Glorias and Credos, and psalms for Vespers. Amongst these works was his Credo in F, which features the famous 8vv Crucifixus movement.
Lotti composed three operas in Dresden, Giove in Argo, Ascanio and Teofane, as well as Il quattro elementi, a musical entertainment.
The Zwinger Pavilion, Dresden
It is not known whether the poor fortunes of Venice in the Eighth Ottoman-Venetian War (1714-1718) had any bearing on Lotti's decision to leave Venice, nor indeed on his return after the war's conclusion. Lotti wrote In omni tribulatione nostra for choir and orchestra, whose lyrics are a cry for God to “lead us in the way of peace in all our tribulation”, and whose character certainly befits the dire straights of the declining Venetian Empire in the face of the advancing Ottoman hordes.
Return to Venice
Lotti returned to Venice in October 1719, and was allowed to keep the coach and horses that conveyed him as a parting gift. However, they would have been of little use to him in the calle and campi of Venice, and he is thought to have left them at his villa at Strà. He then concentrated on writing sacred music and returned to his position at San Marco. It is not known whether he deliberately made a decision never to compose another opera, or whether events merely transpired that way. On 2nd March 1732, Lotti asked his employers if his student, Giuseppi Saratelli (1714 - 1762), might deputise for some of his duties “at his own expense, reflecting the tireless service paid over the course of forty years”. The request was granted unanimously.
After the death of the maestro di cappella Antonio Biffi (1667 - 1733), Lotti applied for the post, but it took three years to decide the appointment. In the first competition for the post on 8th March 1733, none of the candidates received enough votes to be given the job. The other candidates were Antonio Pollarolo (1680 - 1746), Nicola Porpora (1686 - 1768) and Antonio Pacelli. Lotti received 6 yes votes and 6 ‘no’s; the others all received more ‘no’s than ‘yes’es. The Miserere in Dm and Benedictus in C that Lotti wrote in this year are thought to have been composed as a showcase of his abilities. (Though some sources date them considerably earlier.) Lotti was eventually elected maestro di cappella on 2nd April 1736, this time in competition with Pollarollo and Giovanni Porta (1675 - 1755). Nine of the twelve procurators of San Marco voted in his favour. The job paid 400 ducats and came with accommodation nearby.
Just over a month after taking the post, he composed the madrigal Spirto di Dio ch'essend'il mondo, for the annual Marriage to the Sea (Sposalizio del Mare), a ceremony that was performed on Ascension Day (10th May that year) when Venice symbolically wed itself to the Adriatic. The practice continued every year from c. 1000 until the fall of the Republic on 12 May 1797. The lyrics were written by Zaccaria Valaresso (1686-1769), who also wrote the words for Lotti's oratorio, Gioas, re di Giuda (now lost). The madrigal is available from Ancient Groove Music.
Lotti also taught at, and composed for, the Ospedale degli Incurabili, one of the four Ospedali in Venice, maintained by the State as schools for female orphans and the abandoned – usually the children of courtesans. The schools were also funded by rich patrons who sent their daughters to the Ospedali for the benefit of the musical education that they received. Lotti's contemporary, Antonio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) did similar work at the Ospedale della Pietà. The Ospedale where Lotti taught was situated on the Zattere embankment of Venice's Dorsoduro – a few doors along from the church of Spirito Santo, where Lotti was for a time maestro di cappella. The house of the poet and lyricist Apostolo Zeno (1668 - 1750) was a few doors further along to the west. Lotti composed four operas to libretti by Zeno.
Zattere, Venice: Ospedale degli Incurabili is white building on left; Spirito Santo is 2nd from right.
He was a member of the Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia, a form of musicians' benevolent society, founded on 25 Nov 1687. He was one of the first to enrol, and was still on their lists in 1737.
Controversy
In a concert given by the Academy of Ancient Music in London in 1731, Lotti's madrigal, La vita caduta (in una siepe ombrosa), from his 1705 collection, was performed. However, this had previously appeared in Academy concerts attributed to Giovanni Bononcini (1670 - 1747), who was working in London at the time. When the authorship was questioned, Bononcini supposedly protested, and although he declined to comment further, his case was taken up by others, particularly Maurice Green (1696 - 1755) who may have actually put Bononcini's name to the work in the first place. The Academy's secretary, Hawley Bishop, then wrote to Lotti, asking him to prove that the madrigal was his. Lotti provided a measured but definitive response to the supporters of Bononcini:
I think that they do not so much consult the Honour of their Friend, because by separating from the Academy, they show a resentment which might be just, were the Dispute about an only Child, but for a Madrigal indeed it is too much, since Signore Buononcini can make others equal and much superior.
He settled the matter with notarised testimony. The incident led to Maurice Greene's leaving the Academy and the fall of Bononcini in London as Handel's star arose. The madrigal is available from Ancient Groove Music.
Death & Legacy
Lotti died of dropsy (oedema) on 5th January 1740. Records of the Procuratoria di San Marco show that on 3rd January, he was repaid 143 ducats for expenses relating to music at Christmas; on 9th January, letters were sent to the ambassadors of other city states, announcing the vacancy following his death. He was buried in the church of S. Geminiano, which stood at the west end of Piazza S. Marco, but was demolished by Napoleon in 1807 to complete the Piazza's arcade. It is thought that his tomb was removed to another location, but its whereabouts are unknown. An obvious candidate for the tomb's location would be Venice's island cemetary of San Michele, but there is no record of the tomb there. There are a number of manuscripts of his Missa pro defunctis in Venice which state: si canta ogni anno nel Mese di dicembre il giorno del suo anniversario in S. Giminiano – “to be sung every year in the mass on the day of his anniversary in December in S. Geminiano”. In February 1740, The Pallade Veneta reported that solemn funeral services for Lotti were held at S. Salvatore. The confused date of December may relate to the anniversary of the first performance of the mass, for two brothers of the Priuli family of Venetian nobility.
Lotti's music is characterised by a use of suspensions, chromaticism, discords and modulation. He is also a keen exponent of word painting, with words such as descendit and ascendit often sung to descending or ascending scales respectively. In several of his psalm settings, the text “sicut erat in principio” (as it was in the beginning) is set to the same music as that at the start of the work. He writes with great care for voices, and is also highly technical, writing complex canons and fugues. His music had a great influence on his contemporaries. Manuscripts of Lotti's music survive in Handel's hand, and a growing catalogue of 'borrowing' from Lotti has been identified in Handel's work. The libretto of Handel's opera Ottone is based on that of Lotti's Teofane, and some have suggested that the similarity does not end with the book.
Handel's Giove in Argo also uses the same libretto as Lotti's, with some modification. J.S. Bach's own library held a copy of Lotti's Missa Sapientiae, and it is thought by some that this may have informed his own B minor Mass. Lotti met both Handel and Bach.
Of the 24 operas that Lotti wrote, only 8 survive complete: Alessandro Severo, Ascanio, Costantino, Foca superbo, Giove in Argo, Polidoro, Porsenna and Teofane. Arias and excerpts from another nine are also extant, and seven are thought to be utterly lost, though a great many arias survive in collections, and they have yet to be linked to particular opera. Of his 8 oratorios, only 2 are thought to survive: Il voto crudele and L’umiltà coronata in Esther.
Catalogue
Ancient Groove is proud to announce a major new series of the sacred choral music of Antonio Lotti. Also a growing list of secular music, including madrigals, opera arias and instrumental sinfonias.

Our technology and culture are based on the availability of cheap energy. Oil is by far the most efficient source of energy, and in the past 100 years, we have grown utterly dependent on it.
However, it is a finite natural resource and we are rapidly running out of inexpensive ways of extracting, transporting, and altering it and its various substitutes. The scarcity of cheap energy in the near future will have a profound effect on our lifestyles and may well threaten the very basis of our culture. How can we adapt to these changes?

Now Pikachu Can Zap You While you Lay Down
Pokemon health equipment could solve all health care woes.
Pikachu's dabbling with the health industry did not end back in April with the release of a Pokemon-themed "Mobile Revolution" series mobile X-ray unit. Today, Inside Games stumbled upon a deluxe X-ray machine featuring Pikachu and friends.
Called X'sy Pro, this all-in-one X-ray set from Shimadzu is a followup to the April machine. Unlike April's mobile machine, this one is meant to be kept in one place. It boasts more Pikachus than its predecessor and support for 100V power.
The ¥6.2 million device will be on display at the International Modern Hospital Show 2009 event at Tokyo Big Sight on July 15. If you attend, take your DS and copy of Diamond & Pearl with you and let me know if there are any downloadable Pokemon!

The Galaxy S3 has finally been launched in 28 countries today and will be released in many more including the UK and US within the next week. Amidst one of the most popular phone launches of all time there were bound to be some hiccups though.
The Galaxy S3 is available in two colours: Marble White and Pebble Blue. Or at least it should be. While the Marble White is readily available in all markets Samsung has been experiencing a bit of a setback: there aren’t enough to go around.
Many retailers have had to stop offering the Pebble Blue S3 and send out apologies to those who had pre-ordered the phone ready for its release. People who had opted for the Marble White will not be affected and should receive their phone as normal and the white version should be available to collect in store.
Samsung has explained that the lack of Pebble Blue Galaxy S3′s has been due to the difficulty in manufacturing the materials that give the phone its colour.
Strangely, Samsung claims that it had invented an entirely new colour to use with the Pebble Blue Galaxy S3 and that this has been the cause of all the supply shortages. Despite Samsung’s boastful claims of being able to invent new colours the mostly likely cause of the delay is the “hyperglaze material” used in the phone’s finish. The official Samsung statement stated:
.”
Prior to its launch this week the Galaxy S3 broke records as the most pre-ordered gadget of all time, racking up an impressive 10 million pre-orders. That’s more than the iPhone 4S, which previously held the record, and makes it almost certain to be the biggest selling phone of the year. Likewise, eBay has reported a phenomenal increase in the number of people listing old mobile phones on the popular auction site this week, presumably for these people to get a bit of extra cash for the new S3.
Even though the Pebble Blue S3 has been delayed the Marble White has so far not encountered any supply problems, despite the immense demand for the phone. The Pebble Blue supply problems are expected to be resolved within 2-3 weeks, according to Samsung. You can keep up to date with Galaxy S3 news on Facebook to find more information on release dates and news in your country.

The whole process will involve changing a file in the /system/app section of your device using a root explore app, adding in a new file and mounting the system. Then you need to reboot and install a voice app from the Play Store. If you are already lost then you might just want to sit this one out.
Current Status:
Working:
-It boots!
-searching through the text-box works
-location services work
-info cards work
-notifications work without modifying build.prop
-Voice now works through Jonny_G’s app
Not working:
-Can’t exit the app using the back button on the Google Now ‘Cards’ screen
-Full Jelly Bean voice search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Devices this will NOT work on:
-Devices that are running anything before Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
-Devices not running an AOSP ROM (in most cases, try anyway and report back)
Still interested in giving it a test? Ya, we thought you might. We know David already has it up and running on his HTC One S sporting an AOSP build and he says it is working great and is really fast. He already set a calendar event. If you want to give it a go, head over to SilentStormer’s XDA thread for full instructions, required files and to join the discussion.

How to See Satellite Views in Google Maps
Google Maps is one of the widely used online tools in Internet. I've found that there are many Internet users who do not use it to its fullest potential. Apart from exploring street map, you can get satellite map of any geographical location of this planet with the help of this powerful online mapping tool. The way Google Maps Satellite imagery is getting popular among online users, it is not difficult to imagine that one day Google maps will let us to take virtual tours to the surface of distant planets such as Mars or Venus.
How to get Satellite View in Google Maps?
To see satellite images in Google maps you need nothing but a click to a tab called “satellite”. Once you go to and click in the right side tab called “satellite”- Google will start loading the satellite images into your computer. And by clicking the location name or city name specified in the map you can see the satellite view of that place.One thing is to remember is that Google maps is not all about satellite views. In fact there are four types of direction modes available in Google maps , which will give you all the necessary direction on how to reach a particular place. You can get direction for going to a place by the following four means:
- By car
- By public transport
- By walking
- By cycling
For example you want to see the satellite-map view from California Street, San Francisco, CA,USA to California Tennis Club and you want go there by car. For getting a complete satellite view of your area, you need to take a look at the right hand side of your Google map;there you will find a tab called “get direction.” Just below that tab you will see two boxes –‘A’ and ‘B’. In box ‘A’ type the name of the place where you’re right now and on the box ‘B’ type the destination where you want to reach by a car. Additionally, if you want to avoid highways or tolls in your journey, then just click the “option” menu-right below the box B-where you can select an alternate route to avoid any highway or toll in the way to your destination. Next, you click the “get direction box”- grey colored, just below box B.This is all you have to do to get the complete route map including the distances and estimated time required to reach California street.
Note:Google Satellite Maps also provides a complete route guide for going to a place by walking, by public transport or by cycling.

Just scroll your mouse forward or keep pressing the "+" mark on the top left to see the Statue of Liberty more clearly.
How old Google Maps Satellite Images are?
There is no difference between Google Earth Satellite images and Google Maps satellite images-both of the tools use the same image database to show you the satellite view of Earth. Normally, the satellite images you see in Google Maps are one to three years old. Though Google is continuously trying to update their collection of image database, they do not provide any information about any their image updates.Only the major changes or updates in Google maps are published at Google‘s official blog:
Access Methods to Google Maps
Whether you want to see Google maps in your PC or mobile phone,you can do so in one of the following ways:
- you can directly go to maps.google.com
- You also can access Google Maps through your phone. Details at
For example, you know latitude and longitude of a place(e.g. 47.771008, -120.41175)and want to find the driving directions for that location from your current position. To find the route map for that place in google maps, you have to write both the long and lat in the “search map” box.Another useful feature that you can take advantage of is to find the latitude and longitude of an area.For that you just need to right click on the map and then click on “what is here”- the coördinate of that place will appear on the search box along with some important photos and details,which will be shown in the left pane of the Google map.
Some Useful Features
- Google maps is not only useful for viewing satellite images of your city, but you can also use it as a means of finding business institution of a place and its vicinity along with finding driving directions. For instance, if you search for any location for a specific business, Google maps will give you all important business listings of that place with phone numbers.
- Google maps have an earth view option, where you can see 3D images from Google Earth superimposed on Maps.
- It can be used to get a complete driving direction information to your destination. You can even select and plan your travel route by entering multiple destination addresses in the Google maps.
- You can use the street view feature of Google maps and navigate within a street of any city to become familiar with the place that you never visited before.
Finally, though many people use Google maps for satellite imagery,it has some outstanding features that are truly useful for travelers such as traffic information and estimated driving cost to a specific destination.All the features of Google Maps are not available in all the countries, you can check if all specified features mentioned in hub is available to your country by going at Map Feature Available in your Country.

gurgaon map please
I use Google Maps a lot, especially when traveling. Its amazing how useful it is and it seems to be a great replacement if you don't by a GPS for your car.
Why is there difference between the visual location of a set of coordinates using google satellite or google map.The difference is huge. The satellite location is correct. Why is the map location off by so much (hundreds of meters)
I want see it

: Volume, Prices Up
Both volume and prices of Westmount real estate surged forward in October, as four houses sold over $2 million including the second-highest-priced sale so far this year.
One upper-Westmount house sold for $3,800,000, but in fact the price was only one percent above its municipal valuation, giving more evidence that many of the higher-pried properties are selling for lower markups than their mid-range counterparts, though this is not always the case.
The average price of 13 homes sold in October was $1,616,923, way up from the average $1,296,556 among nine sales in September, but in fact the average markup was an identical 19 precent for each of the months. For October, the lowest price was $790,000, one of four sales under $1 million. Markups ranged from 1 percent for the $3.8 million house to 42 percent, for one of the houses which sold under $1 million.
It can be said that prices in Westmount have doubled since 2001, and are up more than four times since 1986.
In October there were no condominium sales posted by local agents; the only non-single-family sale was a triplex on Chesterfield Avenue. Things were fairly quiet, too, in adjacent-Westmount with two homes, a triplex and a duplex-type condominium reported, mostly in the Côte des Neiges district just north of the city limits. Volume of sales in adjacent-Westmount is on a pace roughtly similar to last year, though there have been more sales in the Trafalgar-Daulac area this year , and considerably fewer so far in the Shaughnessy Village area.
Some agents have been sensing a slight softening of the market in the past few weeks, but certainly the statistics indicate otherwise.

Dear Tim Cook: Letter from an American Dad, Apple iOS Parental ControlsAuthor: Alan Wallace
Dear Tim,
I have many Apple iOS devices — so does my 11-year-old son. That’s why I’m writing this open letter to you. This is about better Apple iOS parental controls. And it’s kind of urgent.
UPDATE: Ed: It’s all the more urgent given news that Apple had to pull the 500 pxapp because of child porn concerns, reports the BBC. not all.
I want to tie this functionality down to a parent-child related account — separate from my Apple ID. It should know, for example, the relation between my Apple devices and his — for instance, if message limitations are close or if time limits like the ones I suggest above run out. Can you do that? I also want same controls to work if I later get my son an iPhone. That would allow calls to certain numbers at all times – and others at certain times – and it would work even if I turn off games and text that calls and email could be checked during certain time frames.
Also, while the ratings on games, apps, movies and TV shows are great, could you amp up your music ratings controls? I want to lock his device down to age-appropriate lyrics.
Lastly, please add a remote app that I can select from my devices to adjust functions on his. It should work on the fly – just in case I see a reason to shut it down. These reasons come up, believe me. Yes, I could take it away from him. And I do. But with a remote app, I’d also be able to adjust restrictions and other parental controls when I’m not right there. The remote app should, as Apple says, just work. And it ought to be easy.
Tim, I don’t need Apple to parent for me. But Apple needs to work with me here. The company that provides the tools I need to manage tech for my son will win my business down the road, too. I love my own Apple iPad and iPod — and my son gets some great hand-me-downs. But Apple has some catching up to do here. Consider Microsoft. You know, Windows already has strong parental tools that work and they work on the MS Surface, too. Parenting around tech needs some help and I imagine that the same tools that would help me could also help IT Departments with BYOD issues, now that I think of it..
Sincerely yours,
Alan Wallace

[Virtue Online] June 12, 2005--The AAC Kentucky Chapter learned that controversial and nationally known religious writer, Bishop John Shelby Spong, has chosen to use his notoriety to bully a parish priest in the diocese of Kentucky for promoting the teaching of the creeds of faith. The Rev J. D. Brown in his role as associate for adult Christian education, at St Francis in the Fields, in Harrods Creek Kentucky, cautioned a reading group against a curriculum that overemphasized controversial writers such as Bishop Spong, and Elaine Pagels. Father Brown indicated in a letter to them that he could only endorse their activities if they balanced their curriculum by including some mainstream writers who argue favorably for the creedal faith. The letter found its way into Spong's hands. He subsequently devoted two pages in his new book to take a priest and a church, not under his ecclesiastical authority, to the "wood shed" in a national forum.

I had the pleasure of photographing the most beautiful and glowing pregnant girl I’ve ever seen. I wish I looked that good when I was expecting. On top of it, she is the sweetest thing ever. Caring and calm, always smiling. You just can’t not love her. And now she’s expecting her first baby, a little girl. I know she will be an amazing mother and I can’t express how excited I am for her. The only thing we need to work on are these cravings she has. Clementines with chocolate milk…
Jen, I wish you all the best and all the love in the world for you and your little family. You guys will be just fine and Ellie is lucky to be able to call you her mother ♥
Wow, awesome pics! Love it!
Thank you for these kind words. Beautiful photos of the babygirl.

Gorgeous !
She is beautiful! And I love the “you are my sunshine” art
beautiful and fun!
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL! I am blow away with these images!!!
WOW!!!!!!!! Love these.,.

My experiences with "humane societies" has not always been very positive, and
I respectfully suggest that those who urge us to remember that humane
societies and SPCAs are not inherently "animal rights" and should, in effect,
be respected for what they DO accomplish as a part of their mandate as
opposed to what they FAIL to accomplish in response to OUR mandate, are
missing the basis of the original concern.
For me the question is whether or not the organization does more good or more
harm, and not only is that not only not always an "either/or" question, it
obviously one that is not easily judged in all instances (except by
dogmatists for whom anything different from what they decide is automatically
bad).
In Ontario/Canada the problem is this (and I'm going to try to keep it brief,
but it ain't easy:-): The "animal rights" movement, by which I mean as it is
defined popularly in Canada to include just about any group trying to do
anything to help animals, is seen as a threat to social good by the "right"
or "the establishment" or whatever you want to call it.
However, most groups that are thought of as "animal rights" are characterized
by newness; by lack of funding/resource; by passion ruling over what might be
called "enlightened self-interest" and by the fact that they don't do
"hands-on" animal work, or do so to a limited capacity that can be handled
more or less humanely. In short, they don't run shelters, and they haven't
been around long enough to have built up funding/equity...read power. They
may rant, rave, demonstrate and grab headlines...but they only become of
concern when they actually achieve something that hurts the animal users and
abusers.
In the eyes of the bad guys, as personified in Canada by the "anti-terrorist"
Mackenzie Institute (which has steadfastly opposed the animal rights
movement...along with virtually every other social movement, as an
anti-social, dangerous and violent movement in its newsletter sold to the
conservative big bucks interests who love to scare themselves with such
nonsense), we "ARs" desperately want to take control of the resources locked
up in the HS's and SPCA's. The fact that some of us HAVE been involved with
them simply fuels their worst fears.
Many years ago I sat on the board of the Toronto Humane Society. Call me
crazy, but I see nothing wrong with people who believe in the rights of
animals being directors of humane societies, and when founded over 100 years
ago, the THS was definitely "radical" for its time and involved in other
social issues (the Children's Aid Society is actually an offshoot of the THS...which I find absolutely fitting and proper.)
When Vicki Miller, a "radical" whose been associated with both the ALF and
with activism (a major hunger strike. . .she apparently has long since burned
and crashed...I've seen that happen all too often) became president of the
THSs board (at my request) I quit the board to work for the Society as
Wildlife Coordinator. Flash forward to when I and my colleagues were "laid
off", some six or seven years ago.
We didn't understand the whole story, then, but we were curious when a man by
the name of Jack Slebar joined the Society's staff, at a level just below
that of CEO. Slebar's mission seemed to us (we went on to form the Animal
Alliance of Canada; I also joined Zoocheck-Canada's board, and resumed a much
higher level of involvement with the Animal Protection Institute, in
California...so those are who I mean by "us") to be determined to undermine
work we were doing on behalf of animals. For example, an effort to get
snares and body-gripping traps banned in Toronto was thwarted by a letter
from Slebar to the municipal government essentially saying there was no need
for the ban.
The first time I met Slebar was at a meeting where a group of us was trying
to convince the Ministsry of Natural Resources to ban "dog runs" where dogs
were allowed to chase native wildlife in huge compounds (red foxes in one run
we site-visited; snowshoe hares in another). Slebar listened silently through
part of the meeting, and then, out of the blue, said something along the
lines of "the problem is that all of you are always fighting against each
other."
I was dumbfounded. We were mostly friends with 10, 15 maybe 20 years of
co-operative work behind us. And besides, this was hardly the place to make
such a divisive remark.
Ultimately the effort was scuttled.
To try to shorten a long story, Slebar eventually was discovered to be an
"officer" of the MacKenzie Institute, who, according to a reliable source,
claims to have authored articles we have linking many of us (by name) to
animal rights terrorism. (I've since forced a public admission from the
MacKenzie Institute that I am not, in fact, a terrorist:-).
Jack is now the official CEO at THS. The THS still serves as a pound for the
city of Toronto (although the cities various component communities are about
to be amalgamated into one big city, and Slebar is busily lobbying the
transition team to position the THS to do animal sheltering, and even animal
control, for the entire "megacity". )
I think that unless one is hopelessly into denial, it has to be recognized
that any city pound service, whether a tax-funded "private" organization,
like THS, or a municipal organization with an "animal welfare" mandate, is
always in a point of conflict by virtue of the twin requirements to serve the
"human" need of animal control on one hand, while serving the "animal" need
for humane care on the other. In a large, urban setting "no kill" sheltering
simply means that any animals beyond the optimal number that can be humanely
cared for are turned away, OR it means that the optimal number is exceeded,
with horrible effects on the poor animals (particularly with regard to spread
of respiratory virus in cats and stress from crowding or prolonged
close-confinement in all the animals).
This conflict tore me apart when I was associated with the THS (being a
stubborn type I've maintained my damned membership) and I'm not at all sure
that it SHOULD be a function of a private humane society to "clean up"
society's "surplus" animals, quietly out of sight of the people creating the
problem...but that's another issue from the main focus of this posting.
Clearly the Mackenzie Institute's function is to keep what they see as the
anti-social, money-grubbing hands of the animal rights community away from
THS (or any similar) assets. Given the THS's penchant for working with
annual massive deficits, it wouldn't surprise me if a secondary goal is to
keep the THS weak, so that it is dependent upon government and corporate
money...the latter sector realizing that they have nothing to fear from the THS, unlike those "radicals" who have been successfully "purged"...as the THS
will NEVER embarrass them or cost them profits by seeking any kind of end to
institutionalized cruelty that would cost money or cause disruption...of
course they'll gladly do the band-aid stuff and work happily with the pet
industry and others on "feel-good" programs that achieve little or nothing,
while working behind the scenes against those clearly defined as the
enemy....people like us!
And then there is the Ontario SPCA.
Not yet in the hands of the Mackenzie Institute, (although its various
branches have certainly been quietly solicited) it is made up of numerous
"branches" and "affiliates", many of which are quite rural, and have clearly
been targeted by animal use proponents to be infiltrated at the board levels
to guard them against the "animal rights" movement. Thus hunters, trappers,
vivisectors and the like sit on boards and help formulate policy. To a still
lesser degree, this is a problem with the "conservative" Canadian Federation
of Humane Societies (CFHS).
The OSPCA is currently not, in my opinion, a real problem. Notwithstanding
many concerns I may have on a case by case basis, it has done some positive
stuff and has supported, for example, Project Jessie, by providing shelter
for dogs and cats we've rescued from pound seizure (so has the THS, although
they may not be aware of it...and we're not sure we can continue to put
animals there as we have discomforting reason to be concerned that they've
unofficially offered animals to the research community...proof is lacking.)
But in the "old days" I was the one who established proof (that was
subsequently placed into a film I scripted about the seal hunt) that the then
CEO of the OSPCA was using pound dogs to be tested to develop a gun to kill
baby seals. The dogs, scheduled for euthanasia, where doped, then shot. The
idea was that a gun would raise less objections than the clubbing then used
(and still used) in Canada's Atlantic harp seal hunt.
Yes, I know this may sound astounding, but the head of the OSPCA actually was
defending the seal hunt and trying to make it more "acceptable" by developing a gun (on which he allegedly held the patent, claiming that it could be used
in rural animal-slaughter in third world countries and remote areas) tested
on impounded animals...and on baby seals (reports were subsequently suppressed but I've talked to the guy who did the actual shooting and it was
horrendous).
Here's a bit of irony (I think). I actually don't see the animal rights vs
animal welfare distinction as clearly as does Dietrich, and while I agree with
Chris's amendment to his assertion that it's the 'AWs" who make the actual
legislative changes, his opinion is one that I generally share. As "AW" is
"usually" defined (or implied) by the "AR" advocates, I see no reason why an
SPCA shouldn't be considered AR (apart from the conflict that derives when it
tries to do two opposing things....be humane to animals and at the same time
to accommodate society's "need" to dispose of the "surplus"). In other words
because my own definition of rights is pretty precise (it has to be something
that actually WORKS...usually meaning legislation and enforcement) I see it
as something that can only be achieved through reforms that are usually
called "AW" by "ARs" (although not always by the media or public).
But to get back to my essential point....we must guard against that barrier
being crossed whereby an organization does more harm than good. I think it
ESSENTIAL that in all SPCAS and HSs, as well as grassroots groups and AR
groups (or whatever we call ourselves) that the decision makers be "on side"
and firmly committed to the concept we call "animal rights" (let's ignore the
quibbling about exactly what that means).
And we must guard against the infiltration of weakening influences. I don't
know if the new head of the RSPCA is "reformed" or still buys into the
essential concept that it's "okay" to use animals to human ends as long as
you keep trying to reduce the suffering that flows from such use. So I ought
not to judge against him. But given my own experiences (and believe me,
folks, I've just lightly brushed the surface) you'll forgive me if I retain
my cynicism.
And the latest "unofficial" word from the THS is, guess
what...that "management" is trying to force staff to reduce the stringency of
their screening of perspective adopters. The lady you mention would find
her "pet" at the THS.

Hello and greetings fellow otaku,
Well with the release of Final Fantasy XIII only 48 hours away, i figured that it would be appropriate to celebrate the release of this new release of this popular series by doing a special edition of Anime Remix Amv Edition. This Final Fantasy Amv features clips from Final Fantasy X tied to the music of Evanescence’s My Immortal.
Granted I wish I had a PS3 so I can play FF XIII, but I can’t afford one at the moment with school and all. But once I graduate from school, I think I will get one and get this and Blazblue!!!!!!! Now that’s an awesome combination. But enough about that, enjoy the video everyone and I will talk to you guys again soon. Ltrs.

Every month on our site, Jo Miller, CEO of Women’s Leadership Coaching Inc., will answer your career and leadership questions in her Ask Jo column. Please send your question to advice@anitaborg.org, and it may be answered in an upcoming column. To read more of Jo’s career advice, visit the Ask Jo archives.
Like most professional careers, your job probably requires you to work with virtual team-members both domestic and international. You can’t afford to focus on working effectively with only those team members that you can see face to face or even with those working in the same country as you. If you maintain “domestic tunnel-vision” you won’t become as productive and successful as you have the potential to be.
I recently interviewed Marie Pettinos on what it takes to thrive as a team-member in a global, virtual and highly diverse workforce. Currently Senior Director of Strategic Business Management at Siemens Healthcare, Pettinos grew up splitting her time between New York and Ireland,. She has since worked in Japan, England and India.
Her role now requires her to lead globally distributed teams that she coaches to break out of their geographic silos and build trust, alignment and accountability in their virtual workplace relationships. Here are what she considers critical skills for being effective as a team-member in a virtual workforce.
Start from a position of trust
“In the past, I have had team-members take an exception to working with virtual peers”, said Pettinos. They would ask “How do we know they’re really working? How do I know that they’re putting as much time into this as I am?”
“The most critical skill is to start from a position of trust,” she advised. “You have to trust that all team members are aligned and working with you on the same objective. Assume that they are there and that they are working. Whether they’re sitting at their desk or sitting on their bed or wherever they’re doing it, they’re actually working.”
Engage remote employees
Whether you are leading a meeting, leading a group or participating as a team member, you need to engage the remote employees. “It often happens that there are teams partially collected in a remote location,” observed Pettinos. “Engage those remote people, first and foremost. Make sure they know that they’re part of the team.”
Effective facilitation of virtual meetings requires being very inclusive. “Start by asking for participation from the people on the phone”, she suggested. “Be very aware, if you’re leading the discussion, to direct your conversation towards the microphone. You’ve probably seen examples where people turn away to look at a whiteboard or screen and without realizing that people on the phone can’t hear them.”
Don’t forget to compensate for your own cultural biases. “Pause and wait for input. In certain cultures within the United States and elsewhere, we’re very quick to talk over somebody to make sure we get our point heard,” Pettinos pointed out. “In some cultures, to be respectful of people’s space and time, they’ll let you finish the sentence before they jump in. Allow people to contribute.”
And don’t always presume that the meeting should be at your convenience. Pettinos recommends being highly sensitive to time zones. “Be flexible. Compromise, and make sure you’re really inclusive of everybody.”
Treat everybody like they are in the room
Finally, your objective as a team-member is to create an atmosphere where everyone can contribute and collaborate fully. “To put everyone on a level playing field, act like everybody is in the room, and that everybody is a key player,”, Pettinos added. “Once you do that, you can actually set the stage for effective collaboration.”
Marie Pettinos was guest speaker in the webinar Working with Virtual and Global Teams, part of Jo Miller’s Emerging Women Leaders webinar series. Join now for immediate access to the webinar.

Clopidogrel is a platelet inhibitor that reduces the risk for new ischemic cardiovascular events, in combination with aspirin, in patients treated either medically or with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after myocardial infarction (1 - 3). Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often given in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin to reduce the risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is metabolized to an active metabolite primarily by the hepatic P-450 enzyme 2C19 (4). Because PPIs are metabolized by the same hepatic isoenzyme (5), concern has been raised that PPIs might inhibit the conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite and thereby diminish its clinical benefit.
Recent studies show that PPIs reduce the ex vivo inhibition of platelet aggregation achieved during treatment with clopidogrel (6 - 8). Clinical studies involving selected populations (9 - 13) show conflicting results regarding risk for adverse cardiovascular events associated with the dual use of clopidogrel and PPIs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (14 - 15) and the European Medicines Agency (16) have recently discouraged the combined use of these agents unless strongly indicated, while emphasizing the need for further studies. We sought to examine the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes related to concomitant use of PPIs and clopidogrel compared with that of PPIs alone in a large, unselected cohort of patients hospitalized with first-time myocardial infarction.
In Denmark, every resident is provided with a permanent and unique civil registration number that enables individual-level linkage between different registries. Our nationwide cohort study linked Danish national registry data relevant to hospitalizations, pharmacy prescription claims, and deaths for 4.65 million people.
For all hospital admissions in Denmark, the Danish National Patient Registry registers a primary diagnosis and, if appropriate, 1 or more secondary diagnoses, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases. The Danish Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics (a national prescription registry) records every prescription dispensed from pharmacies in Denmark, and each drug is classified according to the International Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical system. Information on vital status and causes of death were obtained, respectively, from the Danish Civil Registry and the National Causes of Death Registry.
The Danish Data Protection Agency approved the study, and the data made available to us were such that individuals could not be identified. Retrospective registry studies do not require ethical approval in Denmark. The authors had full access to the data and take full responsibility for its integrity.
From the National Patient Registry, we identified all consecutive patients older than 30 years who were hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction between 2000 and 2006 in Denmark. To ensure the homogeneity of our population, patients with previous myocardial infarction and patients with partially missing data were excluded. We depended on patients filling prescriptions to identify users. Our primary analysis included patients who survived at least 30 days because we reasoned that a 30-day period would facilitate correct classification of drug use; most patients who filled their prescriptions did so within 30 days (Appendix Figure 1). We also examined the sensitivity of the results to the 30-day cutoff by examining alternative cohorts that included patients who survived 7, 14, and 21 days after myocardial infarction. Patients who emigrated were censored at the time of emigration.
Using the national prescription registry, we identified all prescriptions of drugs claimed up to 90 days after discharge (Table 1), as well as all prescriptions for PPIs and H2-antagonists claimed within 1 year after discharge. Information on medication exposure for each day of follow-up was also obtained, including dispensing date, type, quantity, dose of drug, and days of drug supply. No data on patient-reported adherence were available. We defined current use as the period from the prescription filling date to the calculated end of the period drug supply. Of note, the national prescription registry has demonstrated accuracy (17), and the use of clopidogrel is reasonably stable over time in this cohort, with a 1-year persistency of 89% after 2004 (18).
The primary outcome was a composite of rehospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke or cardiovascular death. Secondary outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and rehospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Follow-up was up to 1 year after discharge. The diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction and stroke have been validated in the Danish National Patient Registry (19 - 20).
Comorbid conditions were established on the basis of diagnoses noted at the time of discharge from the index myocardial infarction, as specified in the Ontario acute myocardial infarction mortality prediction rule (21). The comorbidity index was further enhanced by adding diagnoses from the year before the event, as was done by Rasmussen and colleagues (22).
Concomitant use of loop diuretics or diabetes medication was a proxy for heart failure or diabetes, respectively, to define high-risk subgroups of patients, as was done by Gislason and colleagues (23).
We used 2 statistical methods to estimate the risk associated with PPI treatment with or without concomitant treatment with clopidogrel.
First, we used Cox proportional hazards models to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. These models were adjusted for the variables shown in Table 1, including age, sex, PCI, income, concomitant medical treatment, and comorbid conditions. Exposure to PPIs was included as a time-dependent covariate.
Second, we performed a propensity score–matched analysis, in which we quantified a propensity score for the likelihood of receiving a PPI in the first year after discharge by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, conditional on the baseline covariates specified in Table 1. Using the Greedy matching macro (; accessed on 27 July 2010), we matched each case patient to a control participant on the basis of propensity score. Use of PPIs was included as a time-dependent covariate, and propensity score–matched Kaplan–Meier estimates were generated to show event rates and time-to-event curves.
To assess the robustness of our results, we performed a series of additional analyses, including an analysis that evaluated how large the effect of an unmeasured confounder would need to be to explain the results, subgroup analyses of different types of PPIs, and a dose-dependent analysis (24). We also assessed the variation of both PPI use and outcome between hospitals and performed a stratified analysis according to PCI and aspirin use. All statistical calculations were performed with SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Our study was funded by the Danish Medical Research Council and the Danish Heart Foundation. The study sponsors had no influence on the study design, data collection, analysis, data interpretation, or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
A total of 71 987 patients were admitted with myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2006 (Figure 1). Of these, we excluded 1889 patients with previous myocardial infarction, 13 324 patients who died during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge, and 368 patients with partially missing data. Of the 56 406 patients included in the study, 24 704 (43.8%) claimed a prescription for clopidogrel within 30 days of discharge (Appendix Figure 1). Of these, 6753 patients (27.3%) claimed at least 1 prescription for PPIs within 1 year of discharge. The use of PPIs was equal in the 2 cohorts and independent of clopidogrel use (Appendix Table 1).
MI = myocardial infarction; PPI = proton-pump inhibitor.
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the study sample at the time of inclusion. Patients who received clopidogrel were younger, were more often male, received less concomitant medical treatment, had fewer comorbid conditions, and more often had PCI than patients who did not receive clopidogrel. Patients who received PPIs were older, were more often female, received more concomitant medical treatment, and had more comorbid conditions than those who did not receive PPIs.
In the first year after inclusion, 9137 (16.2%) cardiovascular deaths and rehospitalizations for myocardial infarction or strokes were registered (Appendix Table 2). Clopidogrel was associated with lower event rates, and PPIs were associated with higher event rates. The event rates were highest among patients who received a PPI but not clopidogrel (26.3%).
The time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (Table 2), based on patients who filled prescriptions for clopidogrel within 30 days of discharge, demonstrated an increased risk for the primary end point (cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke) among patients who received both clopidogrel and a PPI (HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.17 to 1.42]; P < 0.001) compared with those who did not receive a PPI. Among patients who did not receive clopidogrel, PPI therapy was associated with a similar increase in risk (HR, 1.29 [CI, 1.21 to 1.37]; P < 0.001). Results were consistent for the risk for all secondary outcomes (Table 2). The hazard rate ratio of the effect of the interaction between PPI and clopidogrel for the primary outcome analysis was 0.98 (CI, 0.88 to 1.10; P = 0.72).
Using the propensity score generated from logistic regression models conditional on baseline covariates, we matched 6556 patients who received both clopidogrel and a PPI with the same number of patients who received clopidogrel but not a PPI. We also matched 8437 patients who did not receive clopidogrel but did receive a PPI with the same number of patients who received neither clopidogrel nor a PPI. Use of PPIs was included as a time-dependent covariate. The c-statistics were 0.65 and 0.65 for the clopidogrel and nonclopidogrel groups, respectively, which indicates an acceptable discriminative power for the models. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the propensity score–matched populations and P values for the between-group differences (Appendix Tables 3 and 4 and Appendix Figure 2, provide further details). For use of a PPI in combination with clopidogrel, with no PPI therapy as the reference, the HR for cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke was 1.35 (CI, 1.22 to 1.50; P < 0.001), whereas the HR for use of a PPI without clopidogrel was 1.43 (CI, 1.34 to 1.53; P < 0.001). Analysis of the risk for the secondary outcomes generated similar results (Table 2). The propensity score–matched Kaplan–Meier analysis (Figure 2) depicts the elevated risk for cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke for patients who received PPIs with or without clopidogrel.
PPI = proton-pump inhibitor.
Of the 15 642 patients who claimed at least 1 prescription for PPIs, 4698 (30.0%) claimed prescriptions for pantoprazole, 2798 (17.9%) for lansoprazole, 2717 (17.4%) for omeprazole, 5316 (34.0%) for esomeprazole, and 113 (0.01%) for rabeprazole. Results from the time-dependent, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and the Kaplan–Meier cumulative hazard estimates demonstrated no difference in risk associated with the type of PPI independent of clopidogrel treatment (Appendix Figures 3 and 4). We did not include rabeprazole data in this analysis because the cohort was too small to generate reliable results.

In the propensity score matching based on baseline covariates that predicted treatment with a PPI, the risk reduction for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who received clopidogrel and a PPI was 0.82 (CI, 0.63 to 1.07; P = 0.140) compared with patients who did not receive a PPI. Therapy with a PPI had no effect in the group that did not receive clopidogrel (risk reduction, 0.99 [CI, 0.80 to 1.22]; P = 0.89).
We estimated that an unmeasured confounder would have to elevate risk by 2.5 to 3 to fully explain the increased risk for cardiovascular events observed with either PPI or clopidogrel and PPI (Appendix Figure 5). To ensure the validity of using day 30 after discharge as the inclusion day, we examined differences in baseline characteristics at discharge and at day 30. We found that most patients (83.5%) who died in the first 30 days were from the cohort that had not filled prescriptions for clopidogrel or a PPI (Appendix Table 5). Examinations of the study cohort at various assembly time points, including 7 and 21 days after myocardial infarction, revealed no differences in the hazard rate ratios of the effect of the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel (Table 3).
Size needed to account for the elevation of risk from 1 to 1.29. OREC = association between drug use category and confounder; RRCD = association between confounder and disease outcome.
An analysis subdivided by patients seen before and after 2004 provided no evidence of any differences in the effect of PPIs on outcome (P = 0.14). Interaction analyses between relevant subgroups of patients, PPI therapy, and outcome showed interactions (P = 0.035) for concomitant treatment with a PPI and clopidogrel and PCI, with a statistically significant higher risk for cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke in a stratified analysis (HR, 1.40 [CI, 1.19 to 1.64]) than in the patient groups who did not have PCI (HR, 1.21 [CI, 1.07 to 1.38]) (Appendix Figure 6). Stratifying patients by concomitant aspirin treatment showed no effect. Additional sensitivity analyses demonstrated no evidence of any clustering between hospitals and no evidence of any difference between high and low PPI doses (Appendix Figure 7 and Appendix Table.
We found no evidence that concomitant PPI therapy increases risk for adverse cardiovascular events in patients who receive clopidogrel.
We conducted a MEDLINE search to find major studies between 2003 and 2010 that investigated possible interactions between clopidogrel and PPIs. Gilard and colleagues (6 - 7) first drew attention to a possible interaction in a double-blind study that showed a reduced ex vivo antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel when combined with a PPI. Other studies (8,14,20 - 21) have confirmed this finding.
An intense debate is now occurring about whether the diminished ex vivo antiplatelet effect is of clinically significant importance. Several large observational studies (9 - 11,25) found concomitant use of clopidogrel and a PPI to be associated with increased risk for death or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction. However, these studies were not based on populations that represent the average patient who has had a myocardial infarction. For example, the studies from Juurlink and colleagues (9) and Rassen and associates (25) were based on retired patients older than 65 years, and Ho and colleagues (10) presented data from U.S. veterans (98% of whom were men). In contrast, a post hoc analysis of the randomized TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by optimizing platelet Inhibition with prasugrel Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38) (12) found no increased risk for cardiovascular events with the combined use of PPIs and clopidogrel and no difference in risk between the various types of PPIs. A post hoc analysis of the randomized CREDO (Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation) trial (11) also found baseline PPI use to be associated with increased cardiovascular events, regardless of whether clopidogrel was used. These studies were based on selected patients eligible for randomized trials, who were usually younger and less likely to have significant comorbid conditions than many patients who are prescribed both clopidogrel and a PPI. The prospective, randomized COGENT (Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events) study (26), which was stopped before inclusion of patients was complete, evaluated the cardiovascular safety of concomitant treatment with omeprazole and clopidogrel and found no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk. Similar results were recently reported by Ray and colleagues (13). Of note, preliminary results from the COGENT study demonstrated an increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who received dual antiplatelet treatment without PPI therapy. This increased bleeding risk was confirmed by Yasuda and colleagues (27), which emphasizes the importance of establishing the cardiovascular safety of concomitant PPI treatment. Ray and colleagues' study (13) also illustrated the efficacy of PPI therapy in combination with dual antiplatelet treatment by showing a remarkable reduction in risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who received combination therapy.
Our study furthers the research in this area by investigating the risk for cardiovascular events in a nationwide, unselected population that represents the average patient who has had a myocardial infarction. We demonstrated that PPI therapy did not modify the effect of clopidogrel on cardiovascular outcomes and that PPI use was associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of concomitant use of clopidogrel.
We suspect that the increased cardiovascular risk in all patients who received a PPI can be explained by differences in baseline comorbid conditions that were unmeasured or measured imperfectly. Such unmeasured confounders would have to elevate the risk 2.5- to 3-fold to explain the observed increased risk for cardiovascular events. This is a large but potentially plausible amount of risk elevation for a confounder or a mix of confounders, particularly because these registry data lacked detailed information on risk factors, such as smoking, lipid levels, body mass index, and left ventricle ejection fraction.
We also demonstrated a reduction in risk for gastrointestinal bleeding related to PPI therapy for patients who received clopidogrel, although it did not reach statistical significance. In Denmark, PPIs are prescribed mainly for patients with a clear indication, such as peptic ulcer. Thus, we expected the cohort of patients treated with PPIs to be heavily confounded by the indication for PPIs and to have a higher bleeding risk than patients in countries where guidelines recommend routine use of PPIs in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy. This may explain why our study did not find a statistically significant protective effect of PPIs on risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
Previous studies (9 - 10) have reported that the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes was particularly increased by concomitant treatment with omeprazole and clopidogrel, on the basis of proposed differences in drug-specific metabolism and diminished antiplatelet effects ex vivo (6 - 7,23). Our data set provided no evidence of differences in risk between the subtypes of PPIs, with or without clopidogrel. Sensitivity analyses also provided no evidence of differences in risk related to heart failure, diabetes, age, hospitals, or PPI dosages. However, we did find a statistically significant interaction between PCI and PPIs in the group that received clopidogrel.
Several considerations and limitations may affect the interpretation of our results. We had no self-reported patient data regarding adherence. We were also dependent on patients filling prescriptions after discharge, and we chose day 30 as the inclusion day for primary analyses to avoid a potential immortal time bias. The comparison of baseline characteristics between day 30 and discharge (Table 1 and Appendix Table 5) illustrates this potential bias, because 83.5% of the patients who died in the first 30 days were in the cohort who did not fill a prescription for either clopidogrel or a PPI. The high 30-day mortality rate in this cohort can be explained by the inclusion of high-risk patients who may not have received clopidogrel or a PPI by the choice of their physicians, whereas other high-risk patients who were actually given prescriptions at discharge could have been too sick to fill their prescriptions or could have been readmitted to the hospital before they filled them. Of note, we examined the cohort at various assembly time points, including 7 and 21 days after myocardial infarction, and found no differences in the hazard rate ratios of the effect of the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel in relation to assembly time point.
Our study's strengths include the large size of our cohort based on a nationwide, unselected population that represents average patients in a contemporary clinical setting who have had a myocardial infarction. The Danish National Patient Registry includes all hospital admissions in Denmark and is therefore not affected by selection bias stemming from selective inclusion of specific hospitals, health insurance systems, or age groups. The concordance between drug dispensing and drug consumption is probably high, because reimbursement of drug expenses is only partial, and most drugs, including PPIs, were not available over the counter in Denmark during the study period (exceptions include aspirin and H2-antagonists). Because of the partial reimbursement of drug expenses by Danish authorities, we reasonably assumed that a patient who claimed a prescription from the pharmacy intended to take the drug.
Our study has additional limitations. Clopidogrel resistance has been linked to genotype polymorphisms. Although we have no knowledge of the precise distribution of these polymorphisms in our largely white study population, several studies (28 - 29) based in the countries that surround Denmark found variations in relevant genes that matched those reported earlier for white populations. However, generalizing these data to other racial and ethnic groups should be done with caution. Finally, we had no information on the indications for PPI therapy.
In conclusion, PPIs seem to be associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes regardless of clopidogrel use, but concomitant PPI and clopidogrel use was not associated with any additional increase in risk over that observed for patients who received a PPI alone. We believe that the increased cardiovascular risk associated with PPI use independent of clopidogrel is caused by unmeasured confounders. These results seem to refute concerns about increased risk for ischemic events during concomitant PPI and clopidogrel between the different PPIs would have been more helpful in making conclusions here as different PPIs have different levels of interactions with clopidogrel. The mechanisms of drug interaction is also of interest in this era of polypharmacy

Been down to Brighton Pavilion today to lend a hand.
Its looking very good....the constituency is covered in Green Party posters.
And the Party is increasingly confident of electing our first MP. Caroline is fighting it on a strong left programme of no cuts,
no Trident, troops out of Afghanistan, no ID cards and job creation through a New Green Deal Programme. Taxes on the rich need to go up and we need to stop bowing down to the City of London.
The left in the Green Party are in the strongest position I have seen in my thirty odd years of membership.
Several hundred people have been helping over the bank holiday weekend with canvassing, leafletting, street stalls.
A journalist covering marginal constituencies told us this morning that, the Green Party office in Brighton was the busiest he had seen anywhere in the election so far.
So if you can, come and support. If you support other candidates in other constituencies on the left that's your choice.
However with the threat of three parties committed to neo-liberal policies, in my opinion it is vital to support candidates on the left who can win on thursday.
So spread this message from Brighton and Hove Green Party ''Thank you to everyone who has helped out over BH weekend. If you can help the final push in Brighton on Tues, Wed, Thurs, call 01273 766672'
Salma and Caroline's support for each other is also, I hope you will agree, inspiring.....women leaders lead on left unity.

Anyone who is no Trident and getting troops out has my vote!! Can she run in West Sussex too!!??
On renewable energy, there's not much to choose between the main parties. Interestingly, Gordon Brown revealed in the second of the televised leaders' debates that solar thermal is his favoured green energy - at least in a personal capacity. He chose solar thermal over a wind turbine as a renewable energy installation at his Scottish home. He seems to be very pleased with it, and he recommended it to anyone who is in a position to do likewise.

Star news reports that EVA LONGORIA and MARK SANCHEZ have officially called it quits.
That was fast…
Eva Longoria and NY Jets quarterback, Mark Sanchez, are both back in the market again… again.
The “Desperate Housewives” star confirmed she was dating Sanchez, who is 12 years her junior, in a TV interview with Mario Lopez last month, although dating rumors arose as early as summer.
An Us Weekly source revealed about the former couple:
“Mark adores and respects Eva. It really was about scheduling more than anything else. They will remain close friends.”
The source added:
“There was no drama. They just have completely different schedules and lifestyles.”
So who do you think Eva should go date next?

We knew that, when late January rolled around, there would be a team in Oklahoma City perched around the top of the Western Conference standings. And most would have guessed that there would be a team in Los Angeles in a similar position. But—surprise, surprise—the elite team in L.A. has turned out to be the Clippers, and on Tuesday night on NBA TV, they will square off for Western supremacy against the Thunder at the Staples Center.
It is a meeting worthy of its hype, with (at least) four All-Stars on board, including point guards Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, plus OKC small forward Kevin Durant and Clippers power forward Blake Griffin. L.A. is at the halfway point on its schedule, and it is time to take this team serious when NBA Finals talk arises. The Clippers have great front-line talent, but they also have enviable depth that has allowed them to withstand the same sort of rash of injuries that hurt them last year.
“You have to think they’re a legitimate contender, it’s not too early to say that,” NBA TV analyst Greg Anthony said Monday morning. “The next question is to figure out whether they can actually win. That’s another thing in and of itself. The Clippers have handled themselves very well. They have dealt with as much injury as anyone in the league, and yet they still find themselves (tied for) the best record in the league. You have to accept that they are one of those teams—and you have to remember they had a pretty good year last year. They beat Memphis in a seventh game (in the first round of the playoffs) on the road. That it pretty impressive. They are going to have confidence, and now they are going to have experience. They are definitely a contender.”
At the midway point, the Clippers ranked fourth in the league in offensive efficiency and third in the league in defensive efficiency. No team in the East ranks in the top 10 in both categories, and only two in the West can make that claim—the Thunder (first offensively, seventh defensively) and the Spurs (fifth offensively and fifth defensively). The Clippers have beaten San Antonio twice this season, with both games coming in November. The only game between the Clippers and Thunder, also in late November, was won in overtime by OKC, but coach Scott Brooks said after that game, “It was like a playoff game in November. Everybody laid it all on the line.”
Now comes the rematch. This is probably a more important prove-it game for the Clippers, and it is one that would be especially handy to win. The Clippers play two of their next three games on the road, then go on a monster eight-game road trip that begins next week.
Still, it is entirely possible that we will see these two teams play again during the postseason in May, and the Thunder are well aware of that. On Tuesday night, matchups and weaknesses that could be important in the playoffs will show themselves.
“The marquee is obviously Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook and how they are able to play against each other,” Anthony said. “But I am also looking at how the Clippers contend and deal with Durant. And I want to see how the benches perform, because those are important elements for both teams. I want to see, too, if you’re going to see a little more of a playoff rotation in this game. And on the Clippers side, I want to see how many rim-runs they can get, how many alley-oops—can the Thunder take that away, can Blake Griffin be effective in that low block, things of that nature.”
The Clippers are at the top of the standings. Now, against the defending West champs, they can prove they belong there.

The day he accepted the Florida job, Will Muschamp began to hear the comparisons to his mentor, Alabama coach Nick Saban.
They couldn’t be more accurate, especially after Muschamp, in his first SEC Media Days, detailed the strange case of tailback Jeff Demps.
One of the fastest men in the world, Demps left for Europe this summer to run track with the U.S. national team, and there has been non-stop speculation about his departure from the Gators.
“I don’t deal in rumors, I don’t deal in message boards,” Muschamp said.
When asked if he had spoken to Demps, a critical component (along with Chris Rainey) of Florida’s undersized but speedy backfield, Muschamp said he had spoken to Demps on the phone and that he expects him to play at Florida this fall.
That response was followed by this Saban-esque jewel: “He wanted to run with the U.S. team, he wanted to go to Italy. When he comes back, we’re going to reevaluate where he is. I deal with people eyeball to eyeball. And I ain’t never been to Italy.”
If Demps doesn’t return to Florida, the Gators' tailback options would be reduced to scatbacks Rainey, Mike Gillislee and 200-pound redshirt freshman Mack Brown. That’s not a good sign for Charlie Weis’ pro-style offense, which relies heavily on downhill running and play action passing.
Weis thinks Rainey and Demps can each handle 20-plus carries a game and relieve some of the pressure from quarterback John Brantley to constantly make third-and-long plays (see: 2010). Without Demps, the Florida running game is Rainey and two players (Gillislee and Brown) who have battled injuries their entire career.
“We’re going to be balanced on offense,” said Florida wideout Deonte Williams. “We’re excited about where we are offensively.”

The 2012 NFL Supplemental Draft will take place Thursday. Below is a scouting breakdown of former Baylor wide receiver Josh Gordon, who is expected to be the top player selected.
Also available in the supplement draft are TCU running back Ed Wesley, Boise State DB Quaylon Ewing, Syracuse RB Adam Harris, Iowa State tackle Adrian Haughton, Carson-Newman linebacker Larry Lumpkin, Georgia defensive end Montez Robinson and Midwestern State wide receiver Houston Tuminello.
Selections will be made electronically beginning at 1 p.m. ET.
Teams making a selection will forfeit a corresponding pick in the 2013 NFL Draft.
Josh Gordon
(Vital statistics: 6-3, 220 pound, 4.52 in the 40-yard dash)
STRENGTHS: Gordon's ability to pluck the ball, turn upfield and gain yards after the catch could turn him into an NFL playmaker. While his route running needs work, his ability to use his upper-body strength helps Gordon push off defenders to create separation. Gordon can reach back to catch passes thrown behind him without having to slow, which allows him to quickly get started down the field.
Gordon finds creases after the catch and runs through arm tackles. He turns quick passes behind the line of scrimmage into 10-yard gains and first downs. Gordon has superior speed for his size. This allows him to get downfield separation.
For a player with his physical talent and play-making ability, Gordon surprises with his willingness, effort and production as a blocker.
WEAKNESSES: Gordon was on the verge of being a productive college receiver after a 42-catch sophomore season in 2010, but he was dismissed from Baylor for violating team rules. Gordon was arrested in 2010 on a marijuana possession charge. He sat out the 2011 season when he transferred to Utah. There are questions about Gordon’s maturity and decision making.
Gordon must work on running sharp, precise routes, especially those that require sharp cuts like "out," "dig" and "curl."
In order to take advantage of his acceleration and speed at the NFL level, Gordon must improve his initial quickness off the ball. He has a bad habit of picking up the heel on his back foot at the snap before driving forward, which slows his release.
Gordon must run with a better bend and body lean to release from NFL defenders. In addition, he must wrap up the ball with both hands after catches to avoid fumbling. In the four games graded, Gordon fumbled three times.
BOTTOM LINE: Based on Gordon's 2010 game tape at Baylor, he had better hands and run-after-the-catch ability than Kendall Wright, who was the 2012 NFL Draft's 20th overall pick by the Tennessee Titans. Gordon must improve his routes, but in terms of pure physical skills he has all the tools to be a highly productive NFL receiver.
Gordon is likely to be drafted in the third or fourth round because of his size and potential. Based purely on film evaluation, Gordon is a better prospect than Brian Quick (St. Louis Rams) and Stephen Hill (New York Jets), both of whom were second-round picks in April.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass.—The Patriots entered the season with enviable depth at tight end, and it appears that could come in handy.
With 6:49 to play in the first quarter of New England’s home opener against the Cardinals, receiver Julian Edelman took a short pass from quarterback Tom Brady on the left side. Tight end Aaron Hernandez was on the outside blocking Arizona defensive back Jamell Fleming when Edelman was tackled, landing on Hernandez’s right ankle as he fell.
The Patriots are only calling it an, “ankle injury” at this point and have labeled Hernandez’s return questionable.
Hernandez, who caught six passes for 59 yards and a touchdown in Week 1, remained on the ground for a few minutes before finally getting up and limping off the field with help from the training staff.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive end Da'Quan Bowers was arrested at New York City’s LaGuardia Airport on Monday for illegal possession of a firearm.
Local police booked Bowers after he was caught carrying a loaded .40-caliber firearm while checking in for a US Airways flight from the Queens hub to Raleigh, N.C.
According to the NFL Network, Bowers has been charged with two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. He was set to appear in court later Monday night. USA Today noted that the charges, which are the same as the ones brought against former Giants receiver Plaxico Burress, carry a minimum 3 1/2-year prison sentence.
WNBC-TV in New York was first to report Bowers' arrest.
The NFL said in a statement that the arrest "will be reviewed under our league policy."
The Buccaneers are still in the process of learning the details.
"We're aware of the situation and are gathering information," general manager Mark Dominik said in a statement. "We will withhold comment until we know all the facts."
Dominik and the Bucs drafted Bowers in the second round of the 2011 draft out of Clemson. Since then, injuries have contributed to making him ineffective as a pass rusher.
The Buccaneers' organization, under coach Greg Schiano disciplined approach, has shown it has low tolerance for off-field offenders, most recently trading away talented cornerback Aqib Talib in the middle of the 2012 season. Given that Bowers has been a non-factor in Tampa Bay's defense, it wouldn't be surprising if he's an ex-Buccaneer soon.

Traumatic events in the psychiatric population are prevalent, complex, and often are repeated and ongoing (1–4). As psychiatry residents progress through their training, they have contact with traumatized patients and families from the initial phases of assessment through the recovery process. For example, according to Kessler (5) PTSD is the third most common anxiety disorder in the United States. An increasingly large body of literature about trauma-associated disorders, treatment modalities, and training exists. However, systematic trauma training remains limited and has yet to be incorporated into the core curriculum of graduate training programs, including residency training in psychiatry (2, 3, 6, 7). Trauma training, adapted for psychiatric residents, is of particular importance considering the specific challenges trainees face during the postgraduate years, where a shift from more concrete to more process-oriented thinking can be observed. Also, teaching psychiatry residents is particularly challenging because residents rotate through different services (8). Each service has its own population, culture, and goals and objectives. A comprehensive teaching program for trauma is difficult to integrate into an already-existing complex teaching curriculum, as it must allow for flexibility. Teaching and supervision serve the purpose of enabling residents to reflect on their clinical experiences, along with peer interactions, study groups, and seminars. The Trauma Training Modular Curriculum (TTMC) was created to address the various needs as well as to integrate into ongoing psychiatric training the growing body of literature ranging from assessment of trauma and trauma associated disorders to various treatment interventions.
The TTMC is structured in a modular fashion and consists of 16 modules. Each module begins with a pre-assessment and ends with a post-assessment. Designed to provide a foundation for teaching, each module can focus either on addressing attitudes, conveying knowledge, and/or teaching specific skills. Each module can stand on its own as a single teaching unit. The modular construction of the TTMC allows for flexibility in including one or more modules into an already-existing curriculum. Since learning can be enhanced by the use of different sensory modalities, each module includes visual, auditory, gustatory, and olfactory and/or tactile stimuli. Some modules include the use of the arts and media, such as film excerpts, video clips, music, and interviews. Active participation of the residents is encouraged, using role-play, case discussion, or vignettes.
The individual modules begin with a general description of the topic, such as epidemiology, biology, psychology, psychopharmacology, or specific treatment approaches. Many of the modules include the teaching of practical skills of assessing trauma and trauma-related symptoms. Residents practice techniques for interviewing traumatized patients and families.
Learning how to develop a treatment alliance with patients who may have attachment difficulties is a cornerstone of the curriculum. Becoming aware of countertransference reactions when exposed to severe affective dysregulation, self-injurious behavior, and traumatic narratives (9) is an essential feature of many of the modules. Depending on the content of the module, the goals and objectives include discussion of latest research findings and current debates. The efficacy of particular interventions and “best practices” approaches to trauma treatment are highlighted.
Included are reading assignments and references. A multisensory, multimedia approach utilizes videos, readings, experiential exercises, and guest speakers. The TTMC takes into consideration the development of a trauma training curriculum that moves from the assessment of traumatic events and related symptomatology to trauma-informed case-formulation and treatment-planning. The impact of trauma on individuals, families, and communities is incorporated into some of the modules.
The TTMC is designed to be used as either a single long course or as individual modules, depending on the needs of the training program. As residents progress through training, their level of sophistication increases. The fund of knowledge and skills improves, and the residents' understanding of clinical material moves from concrete to conceptual. The TTMC includes modules that are targeted to junior residents, such as assessment of trauma and diagnostic aspects, whereas modules targeted to senior residents focus on more complex case-formulations and various treatment approaches. This developmental approach to training addresses the need for phase-specific learning objectives and may help in demonstrating clinical competence as required by regulatory agencies. The individualization of the modules allows residency training directors the option to select those that are particularly useful to the needs of their programs.
The TTMC was developed at an academic psychiatry residency training program in the New York City metropolitan area. The modules have been utilized with a culturally, ethnically, socially, and economically diverse population. Feedback from the residents in the program has been positive, and suggestions have been incorporated into the modules. The use of the TTMC as an adjunct to a pre-existing residency curriculum enhances the resident's attitudes, knowledge, and skills in working with a traumatized population. Limitations include the lack of formal testing of the TTMC in other training sites. The TTMC will have to be tested in various residency training programs in order to assure its validity. The input of training directors will be crucial to improve future versions of the TTMC. Standardized surveys will be needed to avoid selection bias. Recommendations for the future include the implementation of the training into the curricula of other residency programs in order to test its wider usefulness.

The rules are simple. We take one unopened pack of baseball cards that was randomly selected by yours truly. We then go through the pack card by card looking for those hard to find White Sox cards.
Our player in tonight's game is a 1988 Donruss pack. The pack contains 15 cards and 3 puzzle pieces. Let's begin.
#1: Doug Drabek – 79 - Pirates
A future White Sox!
#2: Rick Sutcliffe – 68 - Cubs
A trap card! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
#3: Gerald Perry – 437 - Braves
What a nice smile. The lighting on his ear makes him look like he has an earring at first glance. His middle name is June?
#4: Tom Foley – 303 - Expos
An Expo! What a rare treat.
#5: Brian Dayett – 416 - Cubs
What the??!! Another trap card!!
#6: Mike Davis – 281 – A’s
Rockin’ the aviators!
#7: Scott Bradley – 147 - Mariners
The White Sox got the late Ivan Calderon by trading Scott.
#8: Donnie Moore – 621 - Angels
I will distract the hitter by waving my glove at him.
Two trap cards!! AAAAARRRGGGGHHHH!!! OK, I’m over it. That half really sucked. 7 cards left to go. Let’s see if we can get a White Sox card!
#9: Kal Daniels DK - 14 - Reds
Kal is an exciting outfielder according to the back of the card.
#10: Lance Parrish – 359 - Phillies
I forgot that Lance was on the Phillies.
#11: Frank White – 225 - Royals
He’s a Jr. See the Royals can have a Jr. too!
#12: Jim Gantner – 214 - Brewers
I still can’t think of the Brewers as being a National League team. Jim’s middle name is Elmer?
#13: Dale Bryan Murphy – 78 – Braves
OK! That’s the superstar of the eighties that this pack lacked!
#14: Frank DiPino – 570 – Cubs
C’mon!! You’re killin’ me here!!
#15: Mike LaCoss – 436 – Giants
Mike went into the wrong sport. How fun would it have been to say, “LaCoss with the goal in Lacrosse”?
#16: Stan Musial puzzle piece 43, 44, 45
Great. A piece of Stan the Man’s crotch. I don’t want to know THAT much about Stan the Man.
OK, our pack opening is complete. Three trap cards and no White Sox cards! That pack sucked big fat donkey. I suppose there are going to be bad packs like this still out there.
So, that’s ½ point for each card in the pack. –1 for each trap card.
Final score: 4 ½ points
No White Sox cards in this game, but there's always next time on Sox Or No Sox.
3 comments:
Ivan Calderon passed away? I hadn't heard that even though it was in 2003.
A lot of people either have or want to have (including Lance himself) that Lance was with the Phillies. His best years were behind him when he came to Philly and the fans never let him forget. Somehow, while hitting only 0.215 in 1988 he made it to the All Star game as a reserve player behind Gary Carter.
I had forgotten that Lance was a reserve in 1988.
Sheesh, almost as many Cubs as were in the All Star game.

NETERET
NETERET, is inspired by the evolution of ancient Egyptian symbolism and its cultural influence on modern self-adornment, art and cities. Oblique pendants, beads and cuffs, refer to the traces of ancient Egyptian angular architecture found around the world. Each piece references Egyptian architecture as it existed upon first construction, and also how it has continued to inform art and design since. A PEACE TREATY's designs reflect on the predominance and glory of ancient Egypt and its continual mark seen in everything from the construction of obelisks around the world to the linear symmetry of the Art Deco movement.
Breathing vibrant new life into classic mythological icons, this season, APT’s hand-crafted designs depict Egyptian forms; the blues of faience pottery and the Nile; and the reds of the Sahara sands. The gold accented designs are further enlivened by the vibrancy and whimsy of bright enamel and wrapped and braided thread. The NETERET Collection seeks to inspire new mythology while paying homage to it’s predecessors, both ancient and novel.

Drupal 7 uses different hooksPermalink
Drupal 7 doesn't use anymore hook_nodeapi(), but it uses a set of new hooks called hook_node_$op(), where $op is the parameter passed to hook_nodeapi() in Drupal 6. See Converting 6.x modules to 7.x for more details.
more than the parameterPermalink
more than the parameter (which is 100% true) the function now contains the operation. That's it, update, save, etc...
example:
hook_node_insert($node)
hook_node_update($node)
...
$op = 'view' also when search indexing is done under cronPermalink
Remember that search indexing needs to see the whole node, so the node is loaded and hook_nodeapi is called with $op = 'view' for every node on the site during indexing. If you have redirects this could completely cripple cron, and even if you don't it could cause unwanted side effects.
To ensure that you only respond to occasions where the node is actually being shown in full on a user's screen, you can examine $a4 to see if it is TRUE, or include this check (via ) :
<?php
if (arg(0) == 'node')
?>
Better?Permalink
In all likelihood, there is a $node->build_mode for that.
Wrong about timing of "load"Permalink
Where it reads “[t]he node is about to be loaded from the database” is incorrect. When the hook is invoked, the node has already been loaded from the database and the related fields have been populated.
timing of insertPermalink
when $op == "insert"
to say "the node is being inserted" is not quite true if you are altering a node that was created outside of your module.
the node has already been inserted into the database if the node you are altering at any point invoked hook_insert().
Timing of insert2Permalink
I dont think the insert is completely done at this point, if I try to query a node with a join on any CCK fields I get no results. the CCK fields have not been inserted yet. Node fields are there.
Not sure what the order or the inserts are. what hook to use after all inserts from all modules are finished.
gmarcotte is likely correctPermalink
I'm still testing this out but I came to this page with the strong suspicion this was true. The caveman in me was about to rail against nodeapi but I realize all of my code that effects the node is working and any that relies on cck content for the node is failing on $op = insert. Changing weight of the module so that it fires after CCK may be an option, assuming CCK relies on nodeapi for its actions. More to come soon I hope....
hook_nodeapi('validate') limitationPermalink
Note that
hook_nodeapi()is only invoked with
$op == 'validate'when submitting data using the node form, which is why the
$formparameter is available.
It is not invoked when saving data from code.

include import .qif
Hello
I just want to know if the import of qif /ofx files is planned on your roadmap:
Actually I like your software but I use another money management software (ibank) in parallele to analyse past income/expenses with more accuracy. It would great if we could just import actual data through qif/ofx files and it will avoid a lot of time/errors by putting figures manually into cashculator as I currently do... This drawback prevents me from using cashculator as as often as I would like.
Thanks
Regards
Guillaume
ps: will cashculator 2 be free for cashculator 1 owners?

Hello Guillaume,
We plan to add QIF import functionality in Cashculator2, but due to the complexity of integrating QIF file content with existing scenario (deciding which category to assign each transaction), it will be limited to creation of new scenario only.
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
Best regards,
Kosta Rozen

Thanks for the answer
However I am not sure to understand when you say that it will be limited to the création of new scénario? Does it mean that I will need to restart a new project and that I will not be able to adapt the existing one ?
If this is the only limitation this is not very annoying...
Regards
Guillaume
Support Staff 4 Posted by Kosta Rozen on 27 Oct, 2011 11:51 AM
You will be able to create a new scenario from imported data, but not to add imported data to an existing scenario. Therefore, if you created a scenario by importing data, you will not be able to add additional imported data to the same scenario next month.

Hi,
Is it possible to import CSV files into Cashculator?
It's very easy to extract a CSV file from my bank account.
Importing this into Cashculator (i.e. not entering you expenses incomes all manually) would be a useful feature.
Thank you for your reaction.

Roland Martin and CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield talk with Wisconsin State Senator Glenn Grothman about his press release, “Why Must We Still Hear About Kwanzaa?”
Glen is basically saying that people shouldn’t celebrate Kwanzaa b/c the man who founded it was violent and racist.
He got humiliated so bad, especially towards the end.
Roland: Was Christopher Columbus a violent man?
Glenn: *coughs* No he wasn’t
Roland: Columbus wasn’t a violent man? Ok gotcha it’s clearly you don’t study history sir
Where do people like Glenn come from? Who raises people like him? Just go on somewhere.

I considered calling this post Falling Short, to soften the blow. But instead decided to go balls to the wall with what I really mean. Failure. How can I stop being afraid of it if I can’t even stop being afraid to say it?
Dylan said, “There’s no success like failure, and failure’s no success at all.” Whatever that means. But I like the sound of it. I feel there is a potential there that I, with my paralytic fear of failure, can’t quite grasp. My dad says your successes can’t exceed 25% of your failures, so get out there and fuck up! (paraphrased) That’s a little more straight forward.
failed to plant succession, harvested too much at once, washed when i shouldn't have, stored wet in the fridge=2 gallons of rotten salad greens
Erica from NW Edibles recently outed the naked, cold fact that they are spending $2,000 to have a chicken coop built for them. Wow, brave girl. I would have hidden that one under my bed for sure. In a locked box. That’s what they invented lies for, Erica.
I’m not mentioning Erica because I think their $2,000 chicken coop represents failure. Please don’t misunderstand! It’s dangerous ground we tread here. But she lays bare her feelings of falling short of that shiny Urban Homesteader Ideal, and I know just what she means. I know how life can lead you on a crazy circuitous path, which cannot be traveled backwards, and then deposit you *BAM* where you least expected to end up. Picking yourself up, dusting off and finding a way to keep on is the stuff of saints as far as I’m concerned. Or beetles.
Myself, when fear of failure or the associated guilt of transgression hits, I can sometimes be completely incapacitated. I’ve abandoned many a project when the first failures start rolling in, or even just because failure lurked around the next bend. And that ain’t no good, no how.
Maybe it’s just me. One of my little Issues. But I’ve been fascinated by my crippling fear of failure and it’s many reprecussions throughout my life.
Long, loooong ago, when I worked as a “handler” for a dog musher back in Alaska, it was my job to run the dogs every day. Riding a dog sled, particularly on a low snow winter like that one was, is a skill that took me months to even get an edge on. I had a little epiphany on one of the many occasions that I was being dragged behind the tipped over sled (never, never let go of the sled), face down over the fast moving snow. I realized that when the sled went round a corner, I needed to lean in to the curve. But instead my fear of the speed made me lean outward, in a visceral desire to abandon the sled. Leaning out on a curve tips the sled over. Simple physics.
I don’t believe, as some do, that your thoughts somehow energistically manifest into your life to create what you want or fear. But my sled epiphany made me see how fear drives me to act in a certain way, a fearful way, that sometimes causes the very thing I fear to happen. It’s not magic, it’s logic. With a heavy dose of irony.
i loved this lemon tree. then i forgot to water it. for several months. now it's dying, covered with tiny lemons, and dying. damn me!
In addition to the negative of sabotaging our efforts, there’s a big, important positive to failure. Nothing is more instructive. Imagine if you refused to let your kid play with pen and paper until they could write a perfect ‘A.’ Obviously kids have to practice a lot before they learn to write, and ‘practice’ means fucking around with a pen and paper. Each distinct failure teaches us so many, many things that simple success can never offer.
The trick to abolishing our fear of failure and embracing it instead as our benificent teacher (a trick that I have failed to learn as of yet) is not to let our every action define us. Isn’t that what I strive to teach my kids? You may do a mean thing to a friend, that doesn’t make you a mean person. You may fail to consume all the cases of marmalade you so eagerly sliced, cooked and canned last year and instead have to dump them down the drain to free the jars for other purposes (ahem) but that does not mean you are a failure.
Another point which must be sharpened is that a lot of what we perceive as “failure” is actually only failure to live up to an impossible fantasy of perfection. Take Erica and her coop. Some part of her might feel that she has failed to be the uber-cool urban homesteader who does everything herself on a shoestring budget. But in fact, all she has done is prioritize her time. There’s a limited quantity of it, don’t you know.
Actually you might not know. I’m not sure whether I really do. The capitalist system and our unleashed advertising industry has worked very hard to make us believe that there are no such limits. This is really a whole post of it’s own that has lay dormant in my mind for months. I believe it affects every aspect of our lives and I have much too much to say about it. But, relevant to this subject, they saturate us with the unspoken premise that there are no limits, no need to choose priorities, you can have it all! (just sign here).
There follows a seemingly reasonable equation: If ‘all’ is possible, and I can’t achieve ‘all,’ I failed.
I assure you, it’s the equation that’s at fault!
Even though I understand this well with my intellect, that deeper core of my brain that advertising plugs straight into still Believes. And suffers the all the guilt, shame, and fear.
It’s really a lot of what this blog has ended up being about for me. Confronting the impossible expectations we are suffused with. Attempting to slowly erase the 33 years (and counting) of culture telling me I can and should have it all. Teasing out the important bits from the hectic hairball of modern life, making my priorities, and fighting back the scaly beasts of disillusionment, guilt and failure.
Back to the cave with you, foul creatures!
Beloved Boo (once again),
If I could be there to give you a hug, I would. If I could be there to show you a photo of me hanging (literally) from the rafters after a night of full-bore indiscretion (not a good image I know) I would. And why? Cause A) I love outing myself so that no one, no one, no one, will ever take my life history as being neat and B) Cause messiness and failure is part of the journey.
Holy crap girl. What you think? Even those who look like they got their shit together don’t. Or, if they do, it took a good measure of facing off with the folly of ego, self righteousness and plan old fashion head-up-the-ass-ism.
We are all broken creatures trying to find truth in a system that suggests success as some consequence of good choices. That’s a lie. We have all had a cookie dangled in front of our faces — this life, safe life, good life if you make the right choices. Ha.
Fact is, we are all round and soft spirits in a linear and harsh world and it can (and has) made life way confusing. We are all working to undo that capitalist narrative (and you are right to intuit a huge thorn there). We are all banging our heads against that system with some of us are more willing to admit it. The gig is up though.
So when you tell us that you tossed the marmalade down the sink you open a hole in everyone else’s precious stories so they, too, can come out and say….What the hell is this life really about? How do we live up in here? And then we get to talk for real like.
Yes, there is beauty. Lots of it. But I’m here to tell you there is lots and lots of failure. I’m pushing 60 and there is still a whole lot of failure out there, in here, and all around. But like Ram Dass says….”You never get rid of your demons you just invite them in for tea.” Good one that. Too bad you got rid of your marmalade cause I hear demons like it with a spot of toast.
So breathe and accept the brokeness. You will never outrun it. And ignore Dylan. He is a wordsmith but can be full of shit like the rest of us. Besides, ever since he did that Victoria Secret ad I have had a few well chosen words for him. Like…..yeah you don’t want to be a cultural icon but do you have to be a sell out to prove it? But then we go way back. I’ve had a crush on him since I was 15 and used to think he was actually saying something important. Too bad for him I’m turning my gaze to Leonard Cohen – a wordsmith you can still trust.
I should have known.
My top three songwriters: Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Ani DiFranco.
I know Dylans full of shit, but my can he turn a phrase.
Hang in there girl! “Just keep swimming….”
Ah, sweet, sweet, nasty arsed failure.
I bought a fucking hair straightener today. It came in the pack with a hair dryer. Cos I didn’t have a hair dryer. I don’t know what to do with either of them.
Enuf said?….
(Harriet, if you want a sweet man to listen to, may I suggest Xavier Rudd? He’s a gentle, sweet man, with many musical talents. Google, youtube-ify, and enjoy.)
Loved your failures! Not so that I could point and laugh, but because they’re so like mine.
I have about a decade on you, but I remember my ephiphany moment – the day I realized that my failures were not something to run from, but well earned tuition.
Sometimes I need a swift kick in the rear end to remind me to do something better. Othertimes I need that kick to tell me to back off and slow things down. Either way, it’s a cosmic wake-up call and I’m finally, finally listening. :)
Thanks for letting me know others struggle with fear of failure. My blogging is haphazard b/c I often spend way to much time worry if a post sucks or what people will think. I end up frozen by the fear of failing at blogging of all things. :)
Nice to remember to not let it paralyze me. Can’t learn without fucking up a few times. When we are kids we get that but when we are adults we just seem to think we should be perfect at all times.
Now if I can just take that feeling of empowerment with me.
Oh, the $2000 I can cop to. It’s the unending frustration bordering on resentment that’s growing for my sweet infant son who will not go the fuck to sleep. At all. Not for naps, not at night. 8 months of sleep deprivation and I am about to lose my mind. But that’s just between us. Can’t put that on *my* blog, it wouldn’t be relevant. ;)
I did feel guilt over paying for the convenience of someone else building the coop. You have it exactly right: the *image* of DIY Urban Homesteady Girl isn’t: hey, here’s some money to fix my problem (lack of coop). It’s, “Hey, I can tackle anything! I’m capable, I’m competent! I can do it all by myself!” And that’s just not reality.
I try to remind myself that a problem that can be fixed by throwing money at it, assuming you have the money to do so, isn’t a problem at all. It’s just an expense. Cancer is a problem, addiction is a problem, laying on the floor sobbing because you’re beyond exhausted and you’re so pigheaded that you keep trying to keep going, even though your brain hasn’t had quiet time for 8 months…well, that’s *my* problem.
$2000 is just bartered time.
If you figure out how to get through to yourself and stop trying to do it all, will you please, please tell me?
Great post, per usual.
Erica,
We need to talk. About babies, and not so much babies anymore, and sleeping and not so much sleeping. I’d direct you to my archives, but I hear you’ve already read them all ;)
I may have missed a few. I spent a good several afternoons on my ass on the couch with your blog but you’ve been at this for awhile; there’s material here. May have missed a month or two. Got a specific post (posts) I should check out?
Once at a monastic retreat, I was very worried about screwing up the amazingly fussy and precise Zen rituals we were going to be doing the next day. I had only recently been lay ordained and though I had my robes, bowls, etc- all the trappings of spiritual materialism, I didn’t have my head very squared away yet.
I diminished myself as only a sort of “home-school” Buddhist from small-town Alaska, and was in the midst of real deal big wigs in brown robes and was really afraid of messing up big time. I told the director.
She said: “look, as a Buddhist, you know that all things are; impermanent, interconnected, and imperfect. Anytime you do anything for the first time, it’s going to be a little rough- even after doing something a zillion times you can still screw up.”
“Whatever it is- just do the best you can with what you got at the time where you are. It’s all you can ever do. Embrace your awkwardness.” she said with a little exasperation. (I think that’s a kind zen paraphrase of “suck it up, cupcake!”)
Anyhow “Embrace your awkwardness” has been a very helpful, as is the (obvious) knowledge that nothing is ever perfect. Though sometimes it takes some VERY big arms to embrace my awkwardness….. Besides, if we waited to be perfect before doing anything, nothing would ever get done.
I went through some of our readings and found one that kind of speaks to this. I’ve attached it below.
All the best, I love your blog posts.

Saying Yes to an Open Heart
Diana Winston- Buddhadharma, Summer 2010 Zen, time after time, you learn to say yes. Yes to your jagged breathing, yes to your itchy scalp. Yes to the chainsaw dude across the street, yes to your grief and pain and shame and grandiosity and fear. Not because you want to act on these things, but because they’re true, and fleeting, and simply part of who you are at the moment (but not even the half of who you really are). Your nervous system begins to relax- at last you’re acknowledging the truth of things.
Saying yes means attending to and surrendering to your experience, whatever it is. It means feeling your body when you’re in the midst of a strong reaction or emotion, and letting whatever you find simply be there. It means coming back to your breath, or this present moment, again and again. It means noticing that thoughts and feelings and sensations come and go.
You say yes to your pride, your stupidity, your murderous rage. Naturally you don’t act on you murderous rage, but you allow it to be true within you. It is a very inclusive practice. Nothing is ever left out.
You discover that if you are pushing away your experience, even ever so slightly, you mindfulness is not fully realized, no is say no. “Oh, Jeez,.
Hey Kelly! Great to get a comment from you. Great essay too. This open heart stuff is where it’s at, but oh so hard to pull off regularly…
Ken Robinson did a good speech in which he talked, amongst other things, about the value of failure. It’s called Do schools kill creativity, look it up on YouTube. He’s not a homeschooling guy or anything like that, just saying it like it. He’s talking about the British schooling system but making a very serious point about The importance of failure, as part of the learning curve. I really like what he has to say about education. Oh by the way, I used the quote, thank you! Have a looksey over at Feet on the Ground and Head in the Clouds.
Erica- My boy did not sleep for 8 months either – at all, or only in two hour slots. Drove me nuts but it did change and he became utterly adorable and self sufficient. Just wasn’t a sleeper. It will get better.
Kylie -Thanks, anyone with a sweet gentle nature is worth listening to.
Stringz – Current issue of Oregon Humanities Magazine is on Failure. Might make for good reading.
As so often is the case, so much good chewable brain food over here. Thanks!
Great post, same stuff that’s been going through my head lately too… this Urban Homesteading Ideals business.
As per the chickens thing, I wrote on Sharon Astyk’s recent blog post, chickens are the ultimate urban homesteading ‘accessory’, aren’t they, and they are integral & seemingly essential in many ways. Yet, we are waiting til get ours, til we have time & energy to look after them properly, but I tell you, we won’t be building our own house/ coop after all… same as Erica, we idealised it, we even have some resources, but we don’t have the time or the skills. Erica did a great thing though, in outsourcing to someone who needs the money & the job. In the mean time, I am going to buy local eggs, organic fertilisers and be amused by my children’s antics instead of chickens… and the world will be OK!
I don’t think you need a hug, I think you need a high five! Good on you, for having the guts to throw out the marmalade and know that maybe you don’t need so much next time around. It’s something I deal with… I don’t want to waste anything, I *should* be making the most of an abundance BUT if in the end, I may have wasted energy, resources and my own time to preserve something that gets thrown out anyways. How to know, though, that’s the trick and the skills I am gaining now (hopefully) as a wannabe urban homesteader. And remind myself how lucky I am to be in a position to make mistakes…
Fantastic post and great comments! Failure…yikes, the fear of failure.
When I get down to it most of my “stuff” is connected to a fear of failure is some way, shape or form.
Staying in a job that sucks my soul for one.
Like Erica mentioned, I’m pigheaded- I will struggle and agonize and try to figure out anyway to do it ourselves- to the point of making myself bonkers. And with some things, it just makes me miserable. It loses the joy. If it causes so much angst is it even worth it?
….heres my great fear… that I’m not even trying to do amazing stuff and still I can’t keep up…just as I sort-of, kind-of get one basic thing in hand, say dinner, theres always some other disaster or three to trip me over (literally). All I want is to have an abundent backyard, clean home (full of beautiful, me made wonderful things), be trim, fit and healthy, have some time with the fella, time with the kidlets, time for books… But as soon as one thing has a tick, the others start smelling, yelling, dieing… Yep, my fear is that what I want is simple but that I just don’t have …. what ever it takes to have it.
Thanks again for the eloquent philosophising. I keep wondering how this gift you have can A) reach as broad an audeiuence as possible and B) give back to you (in dare i say it, a monetary way). It would be great to have a class / group / forum for parents where you could facilitate these kinda discussions … compulsory for all would be parents of course (but they wouldn’t get it yet would they?). “HOw to love failure and your new child”. Catchy huh? This would of course happen in your free evennings….

I’ve been told this in studying yoga, but I’ve seen it in many venues of life…a certain amount of tension that is necessary in order to sustain life. It is that very tension that maintains the balance. If there is no challenge, you lose muscle tone. You lose inspiration. Those challenges and potential failures are what keep us learning.
I’ve been on both sides of it. I’m an ambitious person by nature, usually striving for something. But I’ve also had a period of life where I had many things organized just as I wanted them. Or at least, as I thought they should be…and there was a certain limpness to it. I had blocked out a lot of things that weren’t as I wanted them to be because I couldn’t change them. In the end, I had to open up to the stuff that I hadn’t dared to do, even if it meant giving up some of what I thought I was supposed to be/do/have. And it has turned out to be true. So rewarding.
…I guess the point is to stay in that precious, precarious spot, right on the crest of the wave… and sometimes you pitch head over heels and get tumbled in the surf. You land on the beach with salt water in every orifice, coughing. But that’s ok. You’re really not much worse for the wear and besides, all waves end up back at the beach anyway, no matter how you get there. Hahaha, who knew it wasn’t a destination but an endless cycle. Advertising would have us think otherwise. Like getting in shape. As if you were going to “get there” and it was going to last. :) Apparently it’s not about achieving perfection but the humble, ongoing act of striving.
Hmm, is it bad etiquette to leave comments on older posts?
I look forward to the day that “limits” post finishes cooking and oozes out of your brain- or more realistically is carefully and skillfully sculpted- (unless I’ve missed it and am completely showing my sloppy reading skills just now). I spend a lot of my brain power mulling over a lot of those very same ideas. I second-guess my own eloquence into oblivion, so the thoughts don’t produce much more than “nnmeeeee…baaaaaaaad….” when I try to voice them. You’ve got your voice much more sorted out, it seems. (“Work for my entertainment!” said the stranger on the Internet.)

I keep meaning to start the Zakka sew-along. As usual, by the time I get started it will be long done...
Things look interesting here at the table!
Wow, you have lots of great projects going on. Your pot holders using Malka's fabrics look great, I love the Tokyo Subway quilts I have seen on other blogs, and the fabrics you have chosen for your messenger bag have me very excited to see what you create. You can do it!
Wednesdays sneak up on me, too! I always mean to write another blog post on the weekend, but before I know it, it's Wednesday again! :)
I can't wait to see the full reveal of your Zakka quilt. It looks fabulous so far!
I look forward to your Thursday post. Love the black binding.
The flap to project 8 is not difficult at all and the hardware is well described, even though I didn't make it for my small bag. The strap was too thin for it.
Love the fabric combination to your potholders!
Ooh, I'm excited to see your messenger bag. I love them and have patterns for several but still haven't bit the bullet.
The Zakka quilt looks fabulous! Look forward to seeing it in all its glory! And the messenger bag was too scary me! Good luck with it!
Love everything here as usual, but really looking forward to seeing your Zakka quilt revealed.
Yoyu always have so many lovely projects :)
Your Zakka quilt looks fun! the subway blocks aren't bad at all, but I'm pretty sure mine came out a little small. I haven't wanted to measure yet as I'm sure I'll gag if I have to rip out those stitches...Cannot wait to see the messenger bag!
Ooo, can't wait to see more of the Zakka quilt - love it so far! And it's time for the messenger bag already? I need to make that -- but am also a little scared by it!
Cute zakka style sneak peek! Sure you can manage the messenger bag no problem, love the colours you chose to start with :o) Very cunning plan with those bee blocks though, hmmm, that may have given me an idea!
So many cute projects! I am definitely going to have to sneak back on Thursday and see your finished quilt, it looks amazing!
Love the sneak peak of your quilt! I am not doing the Zakka sew along, but sure wish I was- so many fantastic projects!
Hardware always makes me nervous, too. Good luck - I'm sure it'll turn out well. Everything looks great that you're working on.
oh I am sure you will manage the hardware, but yes scary stuff! love the look of your zakka quilt!
I am always amazed at all you do, just lovely too! Wanted to let you know I finally used the Hera tool. It was because of one of your posts that I bought one and I love it! Thank you for your continued encouragement to us fairly newbies! I for one appreciate you!
Great projects! Love your Zakka sew along projects, I'm sure you'll rock the stem messenger bag :-)
The Zakka block quilt looks super cute, what we can see of it anyways! Looking forward to the full reveal.
your projects always impress me, loving all of them!
Man I love that view finder fabric!!!! This reminds me that I need to start back up on my Tokyo Quilt :/ She is a smart girl haha
Very interesting sneak peaks there! I'll be looking out to see the full reveals =D
Good luck with your stem messenger bag! I am sure you will do fine!
Ohhh I love the idea of having my bee piece the Tokyo Subway quilt for me. LOL Better than the Swoon quilt, right?
So if we are linking up to your Tuesdays at the Summer Table party, we have to link a recipe for that week's category, right? I am going to post a roasted chicken here soon, but I guess I can always wait until your grilled week and modify my recipe. :)
Oh, I have made many a bag Debbie and it's a lot easier than you think. When someone gives good directions, and you can see how it comes together, you usually don't have any trouble. Love all your projects!
Beautiful projects, as always! I saw your Zakka quilt on Flickr and it looks awesome!
I missed WIP Wednesday...I'll get it next week!
I loved your Zakka quilt when I saw it on Flickr. Adorable! Love that Melody Miller!!

This grouping: "Holy Ghost & Attendants." It is thought to be the earliest depiction of depth and perspective in rock art. The transparent figure is 7 feet tall and spatter-painted, possibly depicting a robe of fur.
The elongated spectral figures stared out at me with blank alien eyes, and I didn’t know who was watching whom. Arrayed on a panel along 200 feet of Navajo sandstone were dozens of anthropomorphs and animals painted onto the rock, mostly with iron oxide pigments. Late Archaic hunter-gatherers 4000 years ago made this special canyon their seasonal home on the nomadic circuit to collect and hunt. They had plenty of leisure time for their shaman-artists to create some of the most compelling rock art in North America.
I’ve had the privilege of hiking to Horseshoe Canyon’s panels seven times. Each trek brings new discoveries — fine hummingbirds hovering around shoulders, an abraded bighorn sheep herd, indented peck marks in the exact center of the chests of ten figures, or what appears to be a worshipper bending before a ‘man’ with remarkable wings. This place is not called “The Louvre of the Southwest” for no reason.
What part of our civilization will people four millennia hence find? Please comment; I’d like to know. (Sadly, all I can think of is the huge garbage island floating in the Pacific…)
sadly, chert is not what they are going to find….we are such an inteligent species….

In four millennia the major cities of our planet with be under water. The ceaseless activity of the ocean will have eroded all but the largest structures, but the rock piles will remain – testament to a species that forgot that irresponsible pursuit of freedom has consequences.

Dr. Edward Hitchcock, influenced by studies of Agassis and Lyell, concluded in an essay on Historical Geography that Cape Cod was in geological terms the “terminal moraine” of a glacier that once occupied Cape Cod Bay.
Ref. Geographical Review. July 1920 ColgateUniversity.
In March 1621, when the Mayflower arrived in Plymouth transporting English Puritans seeking religious freedom and separatists, there were a total of 102 passengers and a crew of 25-30. After a harrowing 66-day voyage that included a disease that took the lives of two passengers, the Mayflower first dropped anchor inside the hook-tip of Provincetown harbor.
Clearly off course – their original destination was Virginia– they thought they had arrived at the mouth of the Hudson River. Passengers endured the winter of 1620-21 anchored off of Provincetown, from November 1620 to March 1621.
The survivors of that difficult winter established the Plymouth Colony under the strong leadership of William Bradford, one of only five crew members whose names are known today; John Alden being another.
From that time on, the settlements in Cape Cod gradually increased until around 1672 when the Old Colony industries, previously sparse agriculture due to the sandy moraine soil, of fishing and whaling began the upsurge in the economy of the area. Even grist mills and other mills and minor manufacturing continued to grow. Ultimately, Boston became a major seaport and shipbuilding area.
From the early days of the Pilgrim’s settlement, only chronicled by William Bradford, it was tantalizingly apparent that the abundant fish in the sea represented an opportunity for unlimited wealth for the industrious.
A vigorous seafaring industry blossomed from that promise, and the American Dream in the new world had its foundation in Massachusetts.
The resulting ecology and culture shaped the landscape of the glacial moraine known as Cape Cod, even to its architecture.
With running rivers a scarce commodity on Cape Cod, the exceptional Americans demonstrated their ingenuity by harvesting the wind. Windmills dotted the landscape powering local mills.
The women of the seafarers in merchant or fishing ships led weeks of anxious isolation. Alone waiting for their man to return, they paced back and forth on rooftop decks called “widow’s walks.” Here on a small 8 x 10 railed space they would wait often pacing, awaiting a glimpse of a returning ship that carried their loved one. They walked hoping their beloved sailor was coming home.
In more recent applications of American ingenuity on Cape Codit is not uncommon to see solar hot water heaters mounted on rooftops, or even solar panels on middle-class homes attempting to defray the energy costs.
Modern widow’s walks are still built in sharp contrast to the reasons established in the colonial days and the peak of the seafaring days of Massachusetts. These modern widows’ walks, approved by strict guidelines of historical real estate committees, are used for the summer pilgrims to catch a glimpse of the sea during cocktail hour.
What are missing from the modern landscape in Cape Cod are the windmills, which are so desperately needed for the production of electric energy. They are missing because a few rich, local politicians are “fighting to protect the environment.”
The question is from what? Wind? Or hot air?

Background.—
Outbreaks of invasive group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABS) infections have recently been reported. We observed a high incidence of invasive GABS disease among Native Americans at a small rural community hospital between 1982 and 1991.
Methods.—
A retrospective chart review was performed, and all cases of invasive GABS disease were studied for their clinical features.
Results.—
Sixteen cases of invasive GABS infection were identified during the 10-year study period. The rate of invasive GABS infection was 13.3 cases per 100 000 population per year. Mortality was 25%. Nearly half of the patients presented with systemic signs of sepsis without any obvious source of infection.
Conclusions.—
Our experience documents a high rate of invasive GABS infections in a defined Native American population. To determine whether this population has a unique susceptibility to GABS disease requires further study.(Arch Intern Med. 1992;152:1881.

We would like to express an opinion about a recent publication in your journal concerning the use of short-course ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in (otherwise healthy) women.1 We question the use of any broadspectrum agent (including fluoroquinolones) for the treatment of this type of urinary tract infection. We submit that the real value of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics is still as unique oral agents for the treatment of resistant gram-negative bacillary infections when their use clearly decreases hospitalization time or the need for intravenous therapy.
We are currently experiencing a global problem of increasing resistance to microorganisms, some of which are becoming a major concern in the United States (eg, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrugresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycinresistant enterococci). The American Medical Association has acknowledged this problem to the extent that it has announced that its 10 affiliated journals will.

The birth of CASAS+ARCHITECTS emerged from the partnership of two young architects, Jose Pedro C. Recio and Carmelo T. Casas. Both of them had their diversified practice in Hong Kong’s top architectural firms.
The two architects’ international stint with major Hong Kong-based international firms spanned from 1976 to 1988. From there, they decided to form their partnership in October 1988 and took on the name RECIO+CASAS which was initially Hong Kong based.
In 1990, a Philippine office was opened which spearheaded the partnership’s involvement as design consultant for the high-rise luxury residential development, the Pacific Plaza at Ayala Avenue, with Arch. Casas as the Principal Designer.
Since then, the partnership of Jose Pedro Recio and Carmelo Casas undertook the role of design consultant for many projects such as ABS/CBN Broadcasting Studio Complex, Kingswood Gardens, One and Two Lafayette Square, Salcedo Park, and the Richmonde Hotel.
In 1996, another high-rise luxury residential development known as Pacific Plaza Towers in Fort Bonifacio gained prestige for the company. The influx of challenging projects brought Arch. Casas back to the Philippines to spearhead this landmark project which was completed in 2000.
In 1997, the firm Recio+Casas was awarded the first prestigious title of Firm of the Year Award by the Philippine Institute of Architects.
After 20 years, Recio+Casas demerged when Arch. Recio withdrew from the partnership. Arch. Casas continued to run the firm with its new partners and have since then changed the name to CASAS+ARCHITECTS. Since then, the firm has evolved into a new identity specializing in diversified Architectural projects ranging from Residential, Commercial, Institutional, and Entertainment complexes.

Shared Storage is a new storage system designed to enable sharing between all characters on a given account! Until now, your only options to share items between characters were to mail them individually, deposit them into a personal chest at your home, or have a friend hold them while you switched characters.
Shared Storage can be accessed by visiting any Vault-keeper and opening the standard Vault interface you are already familiar with. A new button, “Open Shared Storage”, will be available on the Vault interface:
Any items currently in your standard Vault can be easily transferred to Shared Storage and vice-versa, simplifying the process of sharing items with your other characters.
Shared Storage Interface
The Shared Storage interface has new features to help you manage your shared items. You can sort items alphabetically by name (A-Z, Z-A) and filter by item type. The list is populated dynamically from the items in your shared storage space.
Filtering items is as easy as selecting the Filter drop-down menu and picking the item-type to display:
For your convenience, bound items can be stored in Shared Storage -- but only the character they belong to can retrieve them. The Filter Bound Items option will hide items that don’t belong to your current character. Unique items cannot be stored in the Shared Storage.
This new feature should make managing items across multiple characters much easier!

Overview't be as involved as the full-on "Month of" updates that Guardians and Burglars are receiving, but we hope to address most of the issues brought up by the Champion community as well as giving them the tools necessary to fulfill their class roles in LOTRO.
Choices
Currently, Fervour is the only choice of stance for most levels. The Book 12 Champion update will include a new stance, available at low levels. It won't be as all-out offensive as Fervour, but it will include in-combat power regeneration as well as allowing the Champion to Block, Parry and Evade, though at some penalty. In addition to the new stance, Glory is going to get a small boost in effectiveness and will be available at mid-levels.
These two changes should give Champions a good choice of trade-offs in their stance selection between offense and defense.
Champion Stances
Fervour
Fervour is the base Champion stance and is the basis for all Champion balancing. There are no changes to Fervour in this update.
Ardour
Ardour is intended to fill the gap in the Champion's stances. The high cost of Champion skills, in power and pips, really limits their ability to function without being in some kind of stance. Fervour comes with severe penalties to the Champion's defense, however, and Glory is only available at higher levels. For most of the level range, Champions that needed some defense but still wanted to be effective with skills were out of luck
Ardour is a new Toggle skill exclusive from Fervour and Glory. It's gained at level 10, granting power regeneration and fervor pip generation at a rate somewhat less than Fervour but more than Glory (but with no inherent damage bonus). Parry and Evade defensive skills receive a percentage based penalty rather than being de-activated as with the Fervour Stance. The Block skill is unaffected. The Ardour stance will also convert the Flurry skill into Ardent Flurry.
Ardent Flurry -This skill has the same effects as Flurry, but is activated only on a monster defeat event and lasts until the current combat ends. Switching out of Ardour stance converts the Ardent Flurry buff to normal Flurry.
Glory
Glory is getting a few tweaks to make it a more effective defensive stance for the Champion. It's been perceived to be too penalizing a stance for Champions, and also comes very late in the level progression -- far after the Champion is called upon for tanking duties.
Glory is now available at level 30 instead of 46. A Champion in the Glory Stance will generate Fervour pips over time, though not as fast as in the Fervour or Ardour stances. The threat modifier has been increased and the damage penalty has been decreased to help the Champion hold the attention of enemies, but his power regeneration will be somewhat reduced to help offset these changes. The Glory stance will also convert the Exchange of Blows skill into Glorious Exchange.
Glorious Exchange - This skill has the same effects as Exchange of Blows, but is activated only on a monster defeat event and lasts until out of combat. Switching out of Glory stance converts Glorious Exchange into the normal Exchange of Blows.
Legendary Skills
An almost universal complaint from Champions is that their Legendary skills aren't all that, well, legendary, and we agree. As a result, most of the Champion's Legendary skills are getting an upgrade
New Skills
Second Wind - This new skill is granted at level 14. It can only be used after an enemy is defeated and will restore some of the Champion's Power. Second Wind is intended to cover any shortfalls in power regeneration for Champions that are utilizing Ardour or Glory.
Melee Critical Passive Traits - Champions will now be able to train Tier 3 at Level 35 and Tier 4 at Level 46. The masters of straight up melee combat no longer receive fewer passive melee traits than Lore-masters.
Legendary Skills Upgrades
Fight On
Fight On retains all of its previous functionality as an area of effect power drain, and is a skill best used when the Champion needs to end a fight NOW. The Champion will receive a substantial short-term damage bonus, but when the damage bonus expires he'll be exhausted, with a substantial penalty to power regeneration until the current fight ends.
Raging Blade
Raging Blade adds an additional attack with all the damage numbers tweaked to give around a 15% increase in total damage. In addition, the Winds of the Storm trait will increase Raging Blade's maximum targets to 10.
Ferocious Strike
The damage numbers for Ferocious strike have been increased to give around a 5% increase in total damage. Ferocious Strikes from dual-wielding Champions will see a substantial increase in damage to make it comparable to damage from a 2-handed weapon using Champion.
Other Fixes and Upgrades
Many other Champion skills have been changed to make them more convenient to use, or just been given a boost in power to make them more attractive choices to add to your hot bar. A few highlights are making Sudden Defense easier to activate when in Fervour stance, giving Hedge the ability to remove Disarm effects, and an upgrade to the old Shoot skill to make it more effective than just auto-attacking at range.
Changed Skills
Sudden Defense and Eldar's Grace
Both of these skills have been upgraded in usability for Champions. There are no changes to the skills themselves, but they can now be activated while in the Fervour or Ardour stances. Sudden Defense and Eldar's Grace will suppress the defensive skill penalties of these stances for the duration of the effects; then, when the effects expire, the full effects of Fervour or Ardour will return.
A side effect of this change prevents Sudden Defense from stacking with Eldar's Grace. If both of these effects are activated, only Eldar's Grace will be in effect. After it wears off, Sudden Defense will apply for the rest of its duration.
Hedge
The de-taunt effects of Hedge have never worked to our satisfaction. We've decided to completely change this skill to address another issue raised by Champions, their vulnerability to Disarm. Hedge will no longer reduce the Champion's threat but will instead remove the effects of being disarmed and grant a Wound Resistance buff. The Champion will also be unaffected by disarm while the buff is in effect. Hedge's power cost and cooldown has been increased.
Ire Skills
There are too many cases where the Ire skills are seen to be ineffective, so we've increased the amount of threat these skills transfer and modified their costs. These skills transfer a percentage of accumulated threat; the later in combat they're used, the more threat is transferred.
Ebbing Ire now transfers significantly more threat than previously. Its power cost has been increased and its Fervour pip cost has increased to 4.
Rising Ire now transfers a moderately increased amount of threat. Its power cost has been increased, but its Fervour Pip cost has been reduced to 2.
Shoot
Shoot is a remnant from the time when there were no ranged auto-attacks. Champions still have this skill, but in its current state it serves little purpose. Shoot has been renamed to "Let Fly" and given a damage bonus and a slightly increased range. (This will affect Guardians and Hunters as well.)
Clobber
Clobber is used as a reaction skill to interrupt an enemy's induction skills, but its long animation time was interfering with this purpose. Clobber has been given a faster animation for faster response time.
Sprint
Sprint will now override all other effects that attempt to change the Champion's movement speed. Effects that prevent any movement at all are not affected. While we would like to think Sprint is used by Champions to heroically charge into battle, we know that in practice it is largely used when fleeing from overwhelming odds. This change will make Sprint more effective in escaping fights by negating Hounding Fear and other snares.
Heroics
This skill drained a significant amount of power from the Champion, while in return the Champion's fellowship only gained a limited amount of power -- in many cases, not enough to even use a skill. The power cost for Heroics has been reduced and the amount of Power granted to the Champion's fellowship has been substantially increased.

Epic - Volume 2 -– “Solofication” Pass
By: Bob “Maurath” Hess
Well, this is my first Developer Diary for the Lord of the Rings Online™ team, so I figured I would take a second to introduce myself. My name is Bob “Maurath” Hess, and I am the newest member of the Content Team. I have been working here at Turbine for a little over four years, with the first year working in QA, a little over a year working on Dungeons and Dragons Online as a systems designer, and then for the past two years on Lord of the Rings Online. Previously, I’ve worked on several different projects in LOTRO, including quest and encounter design for the Lich Bluffs region in Enedwaith.
When we first began to look at a 'solofication' pass of the Volume 2 epic, our team knew that it would be quite the undertaking. We ended up breaking the task into two parts, with Jonathan “Berephon” Rudder changing the battle instances in Chapter 5 into Skirmishes, and with me working on the rest of the Volume 2.
Following the breakdown of tasks, we then went about gathering feedback from internal and external sources regarding specific points in the epic which are particularly difficult to solo. To add to my own experience in attempting this content, the QA Department was kind enough to lend a good deal of feedback regarding the 'soloability' of the content using a wide array of classes and character compositions. This feedback was invaluable for evaluating problem points within Volume 2 and became indispensible as we proceeded to implement changes.
Design Goals
There were several overall design goals when undertaking the task:
These specific design goals were addressed using a variety of different methods, which will be further explained in their own sections:
Re-leveling Volume 2 Epic quests:
One of the difficulties of our work environment is that several teams of content designers have varied responsibilities for the type of content that they are creating. During the implementation of the Volume 2 Epic and the Mines of Moria region development, there was a shift in the level spread of specific areas in Moria. Because of this, a few chapters of Volume 2 are not level appropriate for where they are placed. So in an effort to more accurately represent the challenge level of the quests, we changed the level of several chapters in Volume 2. Below is a listing of the quests that have been adjusted.
Simplification of Quest Objectives:
During the play-through of several Chapters, a small number of quests seemed disproportionately difficult to locate quest items for a variety of reasons. Several quests had low drop rates, some had poor quest tracker guidance, several were too difficult to navigate given the nature of the landscape, several had specific monsters that were a bit too difficult given their surroundings and, lastly, the travel time and the number of monsters between objectives was a little high. Due to all of these factors, a wide array of changes were made to several chapters. Below is a listing of several of the chapters, and the changes that were made.
Redesigning several instance spaces for solo and duo play:
One of the more daunting tasks involved with the 'solofication' of the Volume 2 Epic is that there are several pretty lengthy group dungeons that were included as part of the critical path. For each of the dungeons, I will try and give a brief explanation of what was done to the dungeon and the choices that were made during implementation. Please note while many of these experiences are able to be completed as a solo player, many of them allow you to duo the content as well.
In conclusion
Overall, I feel as though the changes made will allow a great number of players who previously could not proceed through the epic to see the rest of the story unfold. While some of these decisions will change how the epic is completed, I feel that we were able to maintain the integrity and creativity of the encounters while allowing a wider array of players to complete it.
“Well, I got the instance done without begging in kin chat and GLFF for hours/days so I would say this is a hugely positive change.” -Feedback from a player in one of our playtests

Prologue
New York City, three years ago
Central Park was glowing.
A dome of crackling blue energy encased Sheep Meadow. Its glow was bright enough to make the surrounding lawns and footpaths clearly visible, even at two A.M. on a rain-soaked February night. The rain evaporated where it hit the dome, creating an eerie halo of fluorescent blue fog around it. Writhing blue tendrils snaked along the ground, detouring around trees and structures. From an aerial vantage point, Steve could see that three of the tendrils had reached north all the way to the lake, making the waters behind Bethesda Fountain boil, and several more were creeping up on Central Park West.
"Can you tell what it is?" he yelled, pitching his voice to carry over the muted roar of Iron Man's jet boots.
"Not specifically." The metal-clad arm around Steve's waist tightened a little as Tony slowed their flight and tilted them to hover vertically above the dome. "My sensors don't recognize the energy signature, which means it's magic rather than tech." He didn't actually add "I hate magic," but the disgust in his voice made his sentiments clear enough.
Steve did a quick visual search for the rest of the team. Spider-Woman was flying in tight circles a few yards below them. Spider-Man clung precariously to the little weather vane tower atop the carousel roof. Luke was out of sight, but he had to be on the ground somewhere, hidden by the trees.
"Can everyone hear me?" Steve called out. Magic tended to play hell with their communicators.
There was a ragged chorus of acknowledgement, broken only by a few mild bursts of static. Thank God for small favors.
"Right. Everyone stay back until we know what we're dealing with. Luke, can you see anything useful down where you are?"
"Just a lot of blue," Luke grumbled. "What the hell is this thing?"
"Hey, guys." Spider-Man's voice sounded a little shaky. "I don't mean to be an alarmist or anything, but the last time my Spider-sense went off like this, Galactus tried to have the Earth for a midnight snack. Not that I think this is Galactus, unless he's shrunk down a hell of a lot and taken up special-effects displays as a hobby, I'm just saying--"
"Thank you, Peter," Steve said quickly. "Tony, can you take us closer?"
"Take care, Captain!" a new voice called out. Steve turned to see Stephen Strange floating toward them, his cape billowing behind him far more dramatically than the speed of his flight would account for. "There is strong infernal magic at work here, and a great deal of energy being channeled. Let me examine the area before you make any moves."
Steve waved his free arm toward the dome. "Be my guest."
"Hold on," Tony said. "Are you using 'infernal' metaphorically here, or--"
"Absolutely not. Whatever this spell is, it's drawing power from one of the hell dimensions. The energy signature is unmistakable." Strange turned toward the dome and made a fluid, complex gesture with his hands. Nothing happened that Steve could see, but Strange's habitually stern expression grew even darker than usual. "I don't know what Doom thinks he's doing, but he must be stopped immediately."
"Doom," Tony sighed. "Why am I not surprised. Is he in there?"
"And is anyone else in there with him?" Steve added. The weather and the late hour would keep most people out of the park, but the place was never entirely empty. If Doom had innocent bystanders trapped in that dome with him, the situation would become even more complicated than it already was.
"I can't tell." Strange gestured again, and shook his head in frustration. "Has anyone contacted the Fantastic Four? They tend to know what he's up to."
"I'm trying." Tony tilted his head back slightly into what Steve had come to recognize as his "checking my readouts" posture. Light flickered in his helmet's eye slits. "No response at the Baxter Building. Actually, I think Reed said something last week about going off-planet."
Knowing Reed Richards, that could mean anything from "intergalactic emergency" to "family picnic three solar systems over." Either way, it seemed the Avengers were on their own for this one.
"We should--" Steve meant to suggest that they join Luke on the ground, but his voice was drowned out by an ominous rumble, followed by a startled yelp from Spider-Man.
"Uh, team?" Luke's voice sounded strained. "Is Manhattan supposed to get earthquakes? 'Cause we seem to be having a doozy right now."
Below them, the ground bulged and the trees swayed. The water in the lake churned, and the carousel sprang to life with an incongruously cheery burst of colored lights and tinny music. At least a dozen new tendrils sprouted from the dome, slithering along the grass in all directions. An icy burst of wind whipped the rain across Steve's face and made him tighten his hold on Tony.
"This can't be good," Tony muttered.
The air around them rippled with energy in a way that made Steve's hair stand up on the back of his neck. The next burst of wind was impossibly warm, and smelled of brimstone. A moment later, Strange arched his back and screamed. Blood burst from his ears and nose, dripped from his eyes like tears. Spider-Woman swerved toward him as he began to plummet, but she wasn't going to be fast enough.
"Peter!" Steve snapped.
A web line shot out to intercept Strange in mid-fall. Steve hoped Peter would find a way to bring him down safely, but there was no time to worry about it now.
"Tony, I don't care if you blast through it or tunnel under it, we need a way inside that dome."
Tony's response was cut off by a burst of high-pitched chittering noise. The night sky above them abruptly became even darker, blotted out by a roiling black cloud that moved toward them as they watched.
"What the hell is that?" Spider-Woman demanded.
A few small fragments detached themselves from the cloud and zoomed ahead, coming close enough to be illuminated by the dome's glow. Steve caught a glimpse of fanged muzzles and webbed, claw-tipped wings. Tony must've seen it too, because it was he who answered Spider-Woman's question.
"Bats."
Chapter 1
Steve crouched on a creaky piece of scaffolding three stories up the facade of a darkened office building, and watched the children play in Bowling Blue. There were maybe ten or twelve kids all together, ranging in age from toddler to preteen, playing some sort of complicated version of tag that involved a great deal of running back and forth across the lawn of spongy blue moss that gave the park its name. The smoky oil-light of the street lamps didn't allow for a clear view, but to Steve they all seemed cheerful enough, not at all afraid, and in the hour since Steve had staked out this block, he'd seen no sign of the spirifer who'd been recently rumored to be preying on the young in this part of Barrelhouse Row.
Children's souls were supposed to be more pure, and therefore more valuable than adult ones. Tempting targets for the illegal soul trade. And many of the ones in Barrelhouse Row had no adult to look after them, making them easy prey. Of all the new breeds of criminal that had sprung up all over the city since the Descent, Steve hated spirifers the most.
"Anything new up there?" A faint hiss of static accompanied Luke's voice over Steve's communicator. They never got clear reception anymore -- too much magic in the air, according to Tony.
"Nothing." Steve kept his voice low. "Anything on street level?"
"Not a peep." Luke sounded annoyed. "I think today's a bust. Or maybe this whole rumor's a bust."
"Maybe." They'd checked No-battery Park and the Zeeport earlier, with no more luck than they were having now. If there was a spirifer, he or she was keeping clear of the area today. "I'm going to wait a bit longer."
"Suit yourself," Luke said over another burst of static. "I'm going to check the side streets again."
A pair of women in shabby coats emerged from the Customs House, collected three of the younger children, and shepherded them inside. The game paused around them, then resumed again, just as noisy and chaotic as before.
Not a care in the world, Steve thought. Children could adapt to anything, it seemed, even perpetual darkness. The younger ones probably couldn't even remember daylight. He wondered how many of the older ones could recall when Bowling Blue was Bowling Green, and the Watchful Minotaur statue at the north end was the Charging Bull. The old financial district now housed most of Lowered Manhattan's formerly homeless population, as well as anyone else who'd felt like moving into the empty office spaces after the Descent. Federal Hall was now a middle school, and the Stock Exchange housed a thriving flea market twice a week. Tony liked to joke that the place hadn't been this financially solvent in decades.
Steve waited, but there was nothing unusual in the intermittent trickle of in-line skaters and bicyclists along Broadway. The tag game slowly thinned out as more children were called home to dinner. A few wandered off on their own, and Steve signaled Luke to track them until they got to safety. He decided he'd wait until the last kid was gone, then head home himself.
A chorus of high-pitched chirps to the northeast made him rise to his feet. Bats were as common in Lowered Manhattan as pigeons used to be, but when they gathered in large numbers it was usually a bad sign. Somebody below shouted. The children scattered, and the riders and pedestrians swerved toward the buildings, taking shelter where they could. Steve hefted his shield and moved along the scaffold, mindful of the patches of slippery black mold that marred the wood.
"Luke."
"I see them." A bulky Luke-shaped shadow rounded a corner at the far side of the park and jogged northward on Broadway. "Shit. That's a lot of bats. I think they're after somebody."
The bat swarm moved down Broadway in a churning, squealing mass that began a few feet above the pavement and filled the available space between the buildings on either side all the way to the rooftops. The entire block went from dark to pitch-black as thousands of wings blotted out the street lights. Steve couldn't remember seeing that many bats in one place since the Descent. What sort of disaster were they bringing now?
He'd just reached the edge of the scaffolding when a web line shot out from the middle of the swarm to anchor against the building directly ahead. Spider-Man swung out in a clumsy, uncontrolled arc, and several hundred bats detached from the main swarm to follow him. He was clearly in bad shape, not in control of his swing at all. The web would keep him from hitting the ground, but he was going to slam into the glass-and-steel wall ahead of him any moment now.
Steve leaped without thinking, all instincts focused on the spot in mid-air where he wanted to be three seconds from now. He bounced off an awning over an abandoned storefront below, let the shield drop to the street as he tumbled through the air, and got both arms around Peter moments before the other man hit the wall. The collision knocked the breath out of him, but Steve still managed to twist as they fell, to take the brunt of the impact when they hit the ground. He rolled both of them over, kept rolling until they smacked into a lamppost and stopped.
Damn. That was close. He would be bruised from shoulder to hip later, but the adrenaline surge kept him from feeling the pain at the moment. Besides, there was no time to worry about minor injuries. The bats were still coming, and Peter was a limp, motionless weight in Steve's arms. Steve struggled to his feet, slung Peter over his shoulder in a fireman's carry, and sprinted for the nearest doorway. He kicked his way inside, and let the door swing shut behind him just in time to keep the bats out.
The place he'd broken into was stripped bare, but the prescriptions counter in the back and the aisle markers between the rows of empty shelves indicated that it had been a pharmacy once. Steve lowered Peter to the floor, and dragged one of the shelf units over to barricade the door. He could hear the rattling outside, as the bats threw themselves against the metal grating that covered the window. He didn't think they'd break through, but there was no point in taking chances.
Peter was unconscious but breathing. His suit was torn and bloodstained in dozens of spots where the bats had nipped and clawed at him, and there was one especially nasty-looking gash over his left ear. He had a bundle strapped to his back, something square and bulky encased in a thick layer of webbing. Steve left it alone and started to tug at Peter's mask instead, but before he could remove it, there was a crash behind him. The shelf he'd used to block the entrance toppled to the floor, and the door flew off its hinges. A pair of Clay Men barreled through, sledgehammers clutched in fists bigger than Steve's head. One of them was missing an ear, and the other had no fingers on his left hand.
Unfinished Men. What the hell had Peter gotten himself into?
"Yo, Cap, catch!" Luke shouted from outside, just as Steve's shield came flying at him over the Unfinished Men's heads. Steve snatched it in mid-air, and got it angled over his head just in time to absorb a bone-jarring hammer blow from one of his attackers. A moment later, Luke knocked the other one to the floor with a flying tackle.
Fighting Unfinished Men took no skill, just brute strength. Steve ducked beneath another ponderous hammer swing, and slammed the shield edge-on into his opponent's midsection. It sank in with an unpleasant squelching sound and a splatter of damp mud. The Unfinished Man doubled over with a grunt, and Steve pulled the shield free and smashed it down on the back of his head. The man went down and stayed down. Steve turned just in time to watch Luke finish pummeling his opponent's head into a smear of mud on the floor.
"Thanks," Steve said.
"No problem." Luke shook bits of clay from his hands. "They'll get up again in a few minutes, though."
"I know. We need to get Spider-Man out of here." Steve knelt at Peter's side. "Are the bats still out there?"
Luke gestured toward the busted door. "See for yourself."
Outside, some quick-thinking soul had smashed open a street lamp and used the flame to set the contents of a trash can on fire. The oily smoke that poured out smelled vile, but it served to keep the bats at bay. A few of the bolder pedestrians were breaking off branches from the dead trees in the park and piling them in the middle of the street to make a bonfire. The bats shrieked and retreated upward. A few tried to dive-bomb the bonfire builders and were waved back with burning branches. Once a proper fire got started, the entire swarm turned and headed northward, presumably back to their masters at the Brass Embassy.
"We need to get a move on," Luke said. "If the devils want Spider-Man this badly, they'll send reinforcements."
"I don't think it's Spider-Man they want." Steve finally detached the bundle from Peter's back and held it up. "I think it's this."
"Huh." Luke poked at the thick layer of webbing with one finger. "What the hell is it?"
"We can find out later." Steve slung the shield onto his back and tucked the bundle under his arm. It felt surprisingly heavy for its size. "Right now, we need to figure out how to move Peter." Normally he might've summoned one of the Jessicas to carry Peter back to the Sanctum Sanctorum, but if the bats were still on the prowl, flying was a bad idea. Maybe they could get somebody to run for the medics...
"Hang on, I see something." Luke hopped over the pile of broken shelving in front of the door and jogged outside. Steve could hear him muttering "Watch it, folks, coming through, coming through..." as he shouldered his way through the crowd, followed by an earsplitting "Yo, taxi!"
Steve used his free arm to haul Peter up again and carry him outside. The crowd on the sidewalk parted to clear his way toward Luke, who was handing a fistful of glim to a wiry young man in a pedicab.
"Come on, Cap." Luke waved him over. "I got us a ride."
And that, Steve thought, was possibly the first thing that had gone right for them all day.
Peter twitched and moaned a few times during the ride uptown, but was still unconscious by the time the pedicab reached Bleecker Street. The Sanctum Sanctorum looked like an abandoned wreck from the outside, all boarded-up windows and scorched, crumbling walls. Inside was warmth and soft light. Wong and MJ met them in the foyer with a first aid kit, reassuringly calm and efficient.
"What happened?" Wong demanded once they had Peter settled on an ottoman in front of the fireplace.
"We're not sure," Luke said. "He had a swarm of bats on his tail when we spotted him. I think he might've had a run-in with some Unfinished Men, too. Two of them attacked us when we first tried to help him."
"It sure as hell wasn't bats who did that." MJ dabbed antiseptic on the bloodied lump over Peter's ear. "He didn't die at any point, did he?"
Steve shook his head. "Not while we were with him, anyhow."
Death in Lowered Manhattan was a temporary condition most of the time; you had to practically dismember an opponent if you wanted to be sure they wouldn't get up again. Still, Wong had been very emphatic in warning the Avengers not to become cavalier about mortal injury. Something about it "anchoring" the victim in this dimension, which would become a problem if they ever found their way back to Earth. Wong was their best remaining authority on magical matters, so they all took his word for it. No one ever asked aloud if a way back was even possible.
"He had this with him." Steve held up the bundle Peter had been carrying. Most of the webbing had dissolved during their cab ride, revealing a rectangular metal box, slightly smaller than a shoebox. The sides of the box were plain, but the top was covered with an intricate arrangement of dozens of interlocking gears, the largest about the size of a silver dollar, the smallest no bigger than Steve's thumbnail. "I think it's what the bats where after."
"Hm." Wong took the box from Steve and examined the gears with a puzzled frown. "Do you know where he might've gotten it?"
"Not for sure," Luke said. "But if I had to bet, I'd bet on the Brass Embassy."
"Not a wager I'd take." Wong ran his fingers over the gears. "Whatever is inside, the devils must value it highly. Locks like this are extremely difficult to make."
"Can you open it?" Steve asked.
"Not without a great deal more knowledge than we've got right now." Wong prodded one of the larger gears to make it turn. There was a series of faint clicks as several of the other gears moved in response. "I've seen similar locks back in our world, but never anything this intricate. The gears must be arranged in a specific sequence in order to release the locking spell. There's usually an accompanying spell to reveal the pattern. Without it, the possible combinations are nearly infinite. I'll check the library, but if the spell was custom-designed..." He sighed and handed the box back to Steve. "You might have Mr. Stark take a look. It is a combinatorics problem, after all."
"True," Steve said. "If nothing else, it might put him in a better mood." Tony was always antsy these days. A nice mechanical puzzle to play with would probably be good for him.
"Great," Luke said. "I'm gonna go upstairs and cuddle my wife and kid. You go keep the mad scientist in the basement happy."
Like all the other levels in the building, the basement in Sanctum Sanctorum tended to adjust to the needs of its occupants. Tony needed a workshop, so he got a workshop, complete with a number of sturdy lab tables and enough space for all the equipment he'd scrounged from Stark Tower and the Baxter Building. When he started spending all his days down there, a bathroom and a shower stall had materialized, then a small nook with a cot and a dresser. Steve privately wished that the house wouldn't encourage Tony's bad habits, but with Strange dead, there was no one around to complain to.
For once, Tony wasn't elbow-deep in circuitry when Steve came in. The generator was off, and the room was illuminated only by the screen of Tony's laptop and a couple of half-gallon jars filled with phosphorescent beetles. Tony sat on the floor in a dejected slump, his back propped against what looked like an eight-foot-tall picture frame made out of wires and circuit chips. He must've been working until recently -- the brazier where he heated his soldering tips was still smoldering, and the air smelled of charcoal smoke. An open notebook lay on the floor at Tony's feet, the pages covered in Reed Richards's illegible handwriting.
"Hey," Steve said, and Tony looked up with a start. There were charcoal smears on his t-shirt and on his face, and he badly needed a shave.
"Steve." Tony's eyes had that bleary look that he usually got when he'd gone more than twenty-four hours without sleep. "Did you just get back?"
"A couple of minutes ago." Steve put the box down on the nearest table and sat down on the floor next to Tony, close enough for their arms to brush. "How's it going?"
Tony let out a tired, impatient sigh and listed sideways a little, letting his weight sag against Steve's shoulder. The contact lasted barely a heartbeat, then Tony shivered and pulled away. Steve wanted to tell him that it was all right, he didn't mind being leaned on, but Tony spoke first.
"I've got good news and bad news." He grimaced and ran his hands through his hair. "The good news is, I now understand how Reed made his multiverse portal work. The bad news is, I can't do it."
"I'm sure you'll think of someth--" Steve began, but Tony was shaking his head impatiently.
"It's not a question of me figuring it out. I have figured it out. But the portal needs negative matter to activate it. Reed must've found a way to produce the stuff, but whatever device he used, he didn't keep it in the Baxter building. It couldn't be just a simple Casimir oscillator, that wouldn't produce enough; he must've come up with something more--" He broke off and made a vague "I give up" gesture with one hand.
"I... see," Steve said, though he wasn't at all sure he did. "You have a working portal, but no fuel for it."
"Story of my life these days." Tony sighed. "Dammit. Ten months of work, and for what? " He tilted his head back and aimed a poisonous glare at the device looming above him. "My sixth dead end in three years. Stupid, useless piece of shit..."
"Hey." Steve sincerely hoped Tony was talking about the device. "Don't beat yourself up over it. You're trying to create interdimensional travel with nineteenth-century technology. Of course it's going to take time."
"Tell that to the million and a half people outside who want to go home," Tony muttered.
It was always like this. In the three years since the Descent, both Tony and Wong had spent most of their time searching for a way to return Manhattan to its proper place in the multiverse, with Wong focusing his efforts on Dr. Strange's library and Tony sticking with what he called "the engineering approach." But where Wong seemed to take his repeated failures philosophically, Tony kept sinking into a blacker mood with each setback. The jokes about the mad scientist in the basement were getting less funny every day.
How many days had it been since Tony had last been upstairs? The fact that Steve couldn't remember proved that it had been too long, and he mentally kicked himself for losing track. He'd made it something of a personal mission to ensure that Tony didn't recluse himself in the basement completely, that he would occasionally come up for a proper meal and a bit of conversation with somebody other than Steve. The others teased him about it -- Luke and Jessica had announced several times that little Danni was available if Steve was that desperate for somebody to nanny -- but they didn't know Tony the way he did. They didn't understand how obsessed he could get, how he let his own health and sanity fall by the wayside when he thought he was failing at something.
It might've been different if Tony could still go out as Iron Man. But Lowered Manhattan had no power grid, not even sunlight to provide solar power. Tony had a generator and a dwindling supply of gasoline to fuel it, and he was hoarding it all for his work in the lab. There was nothing to spare for charging the armor. Without it, Tony had focused all his shaky sense of self-worth on his efforts to move Manhattan between dimensions. And so far, all those efforts had come to nothing.
"I'm sure you'll figure it out," Steve said, acutely aware of how weak that sounded. Judging from the look on Tony's face, he was aware of it too.
"I can't afford to wait for 'eventually'! I'm down to less than a third of my gasoline stash. What happens when I can't fuel the generator anymore and every piece of equipment in this fucking lab turns into a very expensive paperweight?" Tony closed his eyes and tilted his head back to lean against the machine behind him. He looked utterly drained, and not just from lack of sleep. Steve wished he had more to offer than empty reassurances, then remembered that for once he did.
"Sounds as if you could use a distraction." He got up and retrieved Peter's box from the table. "Here. See what you can make of this."
"It's... a box." Tony took it, turned it from side to side, rested it in his lap and ran his hands over the gears. "Where did it come from?"
"We don't know yet." Steve gave a quick description of their run-in with the bats and the Unfinished Men. Tony's expression shifted as he listened, from exhausted gloom to an odd mixture of concern and excited curiosity.
"Is Peter all right?" He demanded when Steve finished.
"He'll be fine." Steve shrugged. "He's had a bad knock on the head, but you know how it is down here. If you don't die, you're all right, and if you do die -- well, most of the time you're all right anyhow. "
"Great." Curiosity had free reign now. Tony jumped to his feet and carried the box closer to one of the glowing beetle jars. "Hmm. Well, Wong is right about it being a combinatorics problem, but there's no way I can try every possible combination here, not when each one has to be set by hand." He raised the box higher and lowered his head until his nose was nearly touching the gears. "I wonder if these come off..."
"You don't think you could just dismantle it, do you?" Steve asked. Tony shook his head.
"The devils aren't stupid. They're not going to build a lock like this and then stick it on something you could just take apart. But if I can see the mechanism beneath the gears, I might be able to figure out how it's supposed to unlock. Or at least reduce the number of combina-- wait, did you know there's writing on it?"
"There is?" Steve hadn't noticed any marks at all. "Where?"
Tony stepped aside to let Steve get closer to the light. "Here, have a look."
Sure enough, once he leaned close and squinted, Steve could see that each gear was marked with a tiny, faintly etched symbol. It didn't look like any writing he'd ever seen, but then according to Wong, the devils in this version of hell had thirteen different alphabets, each with own highly specific purpose.
"I bet it's a cipher." Tony sounded positively gleeful at the prospect. "I bet if I solve it, it'll tell me how to open the lock. I should--"
"Excuse me, Captain. Mr. Stark." Wong stood just inside the doorway, looking slightly less imperturbable than usual. "The Black Widow has just arrived. She says she knows what happened to Peter."
Chapter 2
"For the record," Natasha slurred through a fat lip and a swollen jaw, "I never told him to steal any box. That was entirely his own idea."
They -- Steve, Natasha, Tony and Wong -- were gathered in the kitchen, in accordance with the unwritten house rule of "if Tony comes out of the basement, feed him." Now Wong had a pot of mushroom soup reheating on the stove, and the kettle on the burner next to it, which raised Steve's hopes for the possibility of tea or coffee. Earth-imported foodstuffs like tea leaves and coffee beans -- and flour and sugar, for that matter -- appeared at the Bazaar only at the Masters' whim, and were worth their weight in rostygold. Wong normally rationed them with an iron hand, but apparently the combination of Tony's presence and Natasha's battered state qualified this as a special occasion.
"What exactly is going on?" Steve demanded. "What's in that box, anyway?"
"I have no idea." Natasha winced as she shifted the icepack against her jaw. "All I know is, about a week ago, all these couriers with Brass Embassy insignia started going in and out of the Library. I poked around, and it seems that some senior devil back in Hell has decided that keeping all the Embassy Archives in one centralized location is too risky. So out goes an Infernal Decree, and now they're dispersing the Archive contents to hidey holes all over the city."
"Okay." Steve decided not to ask what Natasha meant by "poking around." She tended to be disturbingly well-informed about doings at the Brass Embassy and the personal habits of devils. "So how does Peter fit into all this?"
"By accident, mostly." Natasha shrugged. "I've been trailing the couriers whenever I got the chance, noting down the hidey hole locations. It seemed like it might be useful intel someday. Know your enemy, and all that. Yesterday, I ran into Peter just as two couriers were leaving at once. I asked him to follow one while I took the other. Follow, that's all. Not rob. I don't know what the hell he was thinking."
"Maybe it called to him," Tony said. Everyone turned and stared at him until he heaved an exasperated sigh and rolled his eyes. "Come on! It's a puzzle box made in Hell. For all we know, it could be sentient."
"Then maybe you shouldn't be keeping it in your lap," Natasha said dryly.
"Good point." Tony moved the box to the table. It sat there, looking perfectly innocent, and showed no sign of calling anybody.
"There didn't have to be a specific reason," Steve pointed out after a few moments. "Peter can be... impulsive, sometimes."
"As opposed to the rest of the superhero community, which is so well-known for its caution." Wong ladled soup into bowls and set them on the table. "We can ask Peter about his line of reasoning when he wakes. The question is, what do we do in the meantime?"
"Whatever it is," Natasha said, "I suggest you do it quietly. I've never seen the devils so stirred up. I was ambushed three times on my way here, and I don't think they even know I'm involved. They're just going after anybody in costume."
"If that's true," Wong said, "then this must be a very important box."
"Meaning I should stop lallygagging and get the damn thing open." Tony sighed. "I get the message."
"Having dinner is not lallygagging," Steve said firmly. "And you're not going to get anything done if you keel over."
Tony didn't look especially convinced by this line of argument, but he did start eating. Steve decided to count it as a victory.
"I'll see what I can discover in the library," Wong said when they were all done with their soup. "It'll help to have a copy of all the symbols on these gears. If they really are one of Hell's alphabets, I may be able to find something useful in my notes, or in one of Dr. Strange's old journals."
"I'll copy it for you," Tony promised. "Hopefully, it won't make my hair catch on fire or anything."
"I don't think that really happens," Wong said, but he didn't sound all that sure.
Natasha refused Wong's offer of a guest room, shrugging it off with a joke about needing to feed her houseplant before it ate the neighbors. At least, Steve thought it was a joke. He got her to borrow a coat and hat from Jessica Drew before she left, and hoped it would keep her from being ambushed yet again before she made it to wherever it was she was living these days.
Tony disappeared into his workshop, and Wong into the library, leaving Steve at loose ends. He felt as if he should be going out and doing something, but there was nothing to be done, not until they had more information. That seemed to be the running theme in Steve's life these days, and he hated it.
He understood the need for good intelligence; any competent soldier did. But ever since the Descent, life had become an endless, thankless scramble for scraps of knowledge; scraps that often made no sense, or made sense only on alternate Thursdays, or needed a thousand other scraps to put them into context. And the end goal of all the scrambling wasn't even victory -- just plain survival.
Both the devils and the Masters of the Bazaar loved secrets, and they loved to keep the human population of Lowered Manhattan guessing. The rules of the world were forever shifting. Curfews, taxes, the number of days in a week, the prices at the Bazaar, the list of proscribed materials -- anything could change at any time, and ignorance of the law was no defense. Only the electricity ban and the law against unlicensed soul trading remained constant. In a way, Steve had to admire the devils' strategy. It was nearly impossible to organize an effective resistance when you had to do three days' worth of reconnaissance just to go on a grocery run.
Here they were now, expending valuable time and resources on what was probably some junior devil's boxed lunch, and all Steve could do to help was wash the dishes.
"Cap?" MJ came in, looking tired but reassuringly calm. "Peter's awake."
Peter appeared to be deeply embarrassed, but otherwise none the worse for wear. He was sitting up on the ottoman with a pile of pillows propping his back and a blanket draped over his legs. The combination of rueful expression and the slightly too-long hair flopping over the bandage on his forehead made him look about twelve years old.
"It just seemed like such a perfect opportunity," he said sheepishly. "A carriage horse near the park got spooked and ran up on the sidewalk, mowed that courier guy right down. He let go of the box. All I had to do was shoot a web out."
"If you ever pull something like that again," MJ growled at him, "I'm going to leave you to bleed to death on the rug."
"No, you won't," Peter said. "It's Wong's rug."
"So what you're telling me," Steve said, "is that you've been attacked, Natasha's been attacked, and the Unfinished Men are out there trying to beat up anyone in a costume, all over a box that we don't know how to open, containing we don't know what."
Peter shrank a little against his pile of pillows. "Yeah."
"Great," Steve muttered, and went back down to the basement to see if Tony was making any progress.
The smell of burnt plastic wafting up the stairs boded ill, and the harried look on Tony's face did not reassure.
"Are you planning to burn down the house?" Steve asked as he ducked through the door into a cloud of smoke. "Because some advance notice would be nice."
"Ha-ha." Tony was waving a spiral-bound notebook in front of his face as if it was a fan. He was wearing welding goggles, though Steve could see no welding equipment anywhere. Maybe he'd put them on to keep the smoke from his eyes. "I've been trying to copy these symbols for Wong, that's all. Except I don't think they want to be copied."
The mystery box was on the table in front of him. It was surrounded with scattered sheets of paper, all with jagged, black-edged holes burned through them. Scattered among the mess were several twisted lumps of charred metal and plastic that might've once been Tony's drafting pencils, and one larger lump whose origins Steve couldn't make out.
"Do I want to know how this happened?" Steve picked up one of the papers and squinted at it in the dim light. "It looks as if you've been trying to write with a soldering iron."
"It couldn't have gone any worse if I had," Tony grumbled. "I tried to be clever at first -- had a stash of double-A batteries charged up from a few days ago, so I popped a couple into a digital camera and tried to take a photo." He prodded the large lump on the table with one sooty fingertip. "That was the camera."
"Ouch." Steve eyed the box with new-found respect. "Maybe you shouldn't be messing with it until we know more."
"Don't be ridiculous," Tony huffed. "It's not hurting me any. I think the symbols don't mind being read; it's the writing they object to."
"The fact that you think they have opinions," Steve said, "is cause enough to worry in my book."
Tony laughed, not very convincingly. "It's just a figure of speech. Of course they don't have opinions. And if they did, I wouldn't give a shit, because I'm not letting a goddamn magic alphabet tell me what to do."
Steve's view of that must've shown on his face, because Tony burst out laughing and smacked Steve's chest with the back of his hand.
"Relax, will you? Tell you what, if these scribbles do start having opinions, I'll just call you down here to disapprove at them. Not even Hell's alphabets could stand up to that."
He grinned, and despite his concern, Steve found himself grinning back. For all the soot and the smoke, Tony seemed to be genuinely enjoying the challenge the box presented. Steve couldn't remember the last time he'd seen Tony like this, energized and excited about his work instead of brooding over his latest failure. Even back on Earth, this side of Tony had shown itself all too rarely. Since the descent, it had disappeared almost completely, and Steve missed it, dammit.
"All right," Steve said, "it's your call for now. But promise that you will tell me if anything goes wrong. Or, better yet, tell Wong. He's more likely to know what to do."
"Promise." Tony traced a little X over his heart. "Now go away and let me work."
"Remember, no burning down the house without advance notice," Steve told him, and went upstairs to finish the dishes.
Natasha returned the next morning, in civilian clothes, bearing a bag of bagels and a jar of spiced mushroom spread. Her jaw had swelled even more impressively overnight, and turned a vivid shade of purplish-blue that clashed with her hair. She and Peter made a fine pair of battered bookends at the opposite ends of the breakfast table.
"It's still a mess out there," Natasha said grimly. "The Unfinished Men are out in packs, and the LMPD is setting up checkpoints. Yesterday they were going after anyone in a costume. Today they're just going after anyone. I hope you all appreciate these bagels, because I got patted down twice just to fetch them."
"Great," Peter muttered. "I do one impulsive thing, and all Hell breaks loose. Literally."
"Really?" Luke said. "Because from where I'm sitting, you've done about a million impulsive things, and now the odds have finally caught up with you."
"Now that's just mean," Peter said. "Entirely true, but mean. Damn, I miss the days when if I messed up, all I had to worry about was a rage-filled editorial in the Daily Bugle. Which was exactly the same as what happened when I didn't mess up, so really not that much of a worry."
"Let's find out what's in that box," Steve said, "before we decide if you've messed up or not. Tony and Wong are both looking into it, but it might take a while. Natasha, you seem to have more contacts among the devils than the rest of us. Can you get anything useful out of them?"
"I can try." Natasha looked uncertain. "I know this filing clerk at the Archive. She says she can get into the records room and find out what that particular courier was supposed to be delivering yesterday. And there are a few junior Embassy officials I've been cultivating. But devils are greedy bastards, and right now they're all nervous, too. I used to be able to intimidate them, if I worked at it a bit, but these days they're more afraid of being caught talking than they are of me. So I'll need bribe money. A lot of it."
"How much?" Steve asked.
Natasha pursed her lips and gazed up at the ceiling for a while, looking as if she was doing sums in hear head. "Let's say... Three hundred thousand echoes. To start with, anyhow."
There was an appalled silence all around the table. Peter, MJ and both Jessicas looked slightly dazed. Luke glanced around dining room with a speculative look in his eye, as if gauging the market value of the furniture. Only little Danni, oblivious to adult concerns, continued to cheerfully bounce in her fathers lap as she gnawed on her bagel.
"Three hundred grand?" Peter squeaked. "That's not bribe money. That's... winning the lottery and breaking the bank in Vegas, all at the same time."
Natasha shrugged. "I'll be asking a lot of devils to run a lot of risk. This isn't just the ordinary business of passing rumors and hints around. We need concrete intelligence here, and the people who have it will have to answer to Hell if they get caught giving it to me. I have to make it worth their while."
"That's great" Jessica Drew grumbled. "But where the hell are we going to get that much money? Is there a human anywhere in the city who actually has that much?"
"The Kingpin," Peter said sourly.
"We are not dealing with the Kingpin," Steve snapped. "I'll go Uptown and talk to the Falcon. He's got his people harvesting glim at the source, they ought to be able to raise a decent sum at short notice."
"Right," Luke said. "I might know a guy who might know a guy who might have a line on some moon pearls."
"Good." Natasha nodded. "I'll talk to the Rubbery Men. If any of them talk back, I can score some amber."
"I'll... be of no use whatsover." Peter slumped in his chair a little. "Man, remember when if you needed a medium-sized fortune, you just went and asked Tony Stark for his pocket change? Those were the days."
"Speaking of Tony..." Steve reached for a bagel. "I should bring him some breakfast."
"You know he might come out of there more often if you didn't keep coddling him," Jessica Jones pointed out.
Steve pretended he hadn't heard that.
Steve came down to the basement to find the generator running and the room flooded with electric light. This was such a rare occurrence that he stopped in the doorway and stared for a while, blinking as his eyes adjusted to more light than he'd seen in months. Normally, even when Tony had the power on, he never wasted it on something as mundane as illumination. They had candles and beetles for that, expensive but legal and fairly easy to find.
"Hey, Tony." Steve finally himself and stepped all the way into the room. Tony was sitting at his worktable, scribbling rapidly in a notebook. "What's going on?"
"Steve!" Tony sounded disturbingly cheery, almost manic. "I've been making progress." He waved the notebook -- slightly tattered but unsinged -- in one hand.
"That's good." Steve shoved another notebook aside to make room for the plate he'd brought down. "Have you been up all night?"
"Don't be ridiculous," Tony said in a tone that clearly meant yes, of course I have. He was wearing yesterday's clothes, including the welding goggles, and his skin had a pasty look Steve didn't like at all. "And anyway, that's not the point. The point is, I've found a way to get these symbols copied over. The trick is to write them down backwards."
"Okay." Steve opened the notebook that was lying on the table. The symbols Tony had put down looked a little bit like Egyptian hieroglyphics, a little bit like some ancient writings Namor had once shown him in Atlantis, and a little bit like the mutant aliens spider he once saw in a cheesy sci-fi flick on late-night cable. In fact, if he looked at them for more than a few seconds at a time, some of the lines seemed to wriggle and squirm on the page. Steve slapped the cover shut and rubbed his suddenly-itchy eyes. "Should I bring these up to Wong, then?"
"No!" Tony swept his arms across the table and gathered both notebooks to him in an oddly possessive gesture. "I mean, not yet. Not until I get it all in order and write up my findings. No point in Wong going over stuff I've already done, right?" He looked down at the pile of paper in front of him, winced, and raised one hand to rub at his eyes. He seemed startled when his knuckles met the frame of his goggles.
"Right. Sure." Steve made a move as if to pick up one of the notebooks, and Tony immediately hunched over it in a protective huddle. "Tell me what's wrong."
"Nothing!" Tony sat up straight but kept his arms folded in a circle on top of the table, as if shielding his notes from some imminent threat. "I just-- I really need to keep working, all right?"
"I don't know, I'm starting to think you need to stop." Steve glanced around the room as the question he should've asked as soon as he came in finally occurred t him. "Where's the box?"
"It's..." Tony fidgeted in his seat a little, then finally lifted one arm with visible reluctance and pointed toward his sleeping nook. "It's over there."
The box was sitting on top of Tony's nightstand, within easy arm's reach of his pillow. The covers on the cot were twisted up and crumpled, though that didn't prove that Tony had actually slept the night before -- he hardly ever bothered to make his bed these days.
"What did you do, take it to bed and cuddle it?" Steve laughed, but the laughter stuck in his throat when he saw the furtive, guilty look on Tony's face. "Wait, you didn't really, did you?"
"N-no," Tony muttered without much conviction. When Steve just stared at him, he fidgeted some more and reached up to adjust his goggles. A thick red drop trickled out from under the frame and slid down his cheek like a tear.
"Jesus, Tony!" Steve stepped forward, too fast for Tony to retreat, and snatched the goggles from Tony's face. "What the hell are you doing to yourself?"
The whites of Tony's eyes had gone dark red. Drops of blood beaded at the corners and more blood crusted his lashes.
"Nothing! It's no big deal." Tony grabbed the goggles from Steve's hand and put them back on. "It's just a side effect of the Correspondence."
"The Correspondence?" Steve repeated blankly. Tony tapped the notebook in front of him.
"The symbols on the box. It's not just a code or an alphabet of Hell, it's an entire language unto itself. I think I'm starting to understand it. But..." Tony gave a shaky grin and a shrug. "It's a little hard on the eyes."
"All right, that's enough." Steve marched toward the nightstand, but Tony put on a startling burst of speed and got there first.
"Whoa, wait! What are you doing?"
"I'm locking that thing away until we know what's in it," Steve told him in his best don't-argue-with-me voice. "It's clearly not safe for you to be working on it."
"Oh, come on." Tony shuffled sideways a little, using his body to completely block Steve's view of the nightstand. "It hasn't harmed me any."
"You're weeping blood, Tony. Also, you're creeping me out."
"Nonsense." Tony smirked. "You're Captain America, nothing creeps you out."
"That's what I used to think," Steve said grimly. "Move aside, I'm taking that box."
"Oh, give me a break." Tony spun around, grabbed the box from the nightstand, and stomped across the room with an air of long-suffering exasperation. He shoved the box into a cabinet on the back wall, dug a sturdy-looking padlock from a drawer, and made a great show of locking the cabinet doors.
"There," he said, finally turning to face Steve again. "Satisfied?"
"Give me the key," Steve ordered, and Tony tossed it to him.
"Now are you satisfied?"
"Not quite," Steve said. "You're coming upstairs with me."
"I need to--" Tony began, but Steve stepped forward and gripped his arm before he could get a proper argument going.
"Now, Tony. You're going to eat breakfast--"
"That breakfast right there?" Tony pointed at the bagel Steve had left on the table earlier. Steve snatched up the plate with his free hand.
"We'll bring it back up. You're going to eat it, and then you're going to shower, because I smelled you from across the room and I really wish I hadn't, and then you're going to go and sleep in a proper bed for once, and you're not going to work on any magic boxes or... or Correspondences until we have more intel on what we're dealing with. Got it?"
"Sir, yes sir!" Tony grumbled, and let Steve drag him upstairs.
Chapter 3
"The Correspondence?" Wong frowned in a manner that in anyone else would've suggested mild concern, but in him served as a sign of incipient panic. "Are you sure?"
"That's what Tony called it," Steve said. "Why, does that mean anything to you?"
They were in the first-floor library, a handsome room that always made Steve feel a pang of nostalgia for the Avengers Mansion. The elaborate mahogany boiseries were more opulent than the Stark family's more streamlined style, but the thick carpets and the antique furniture gave the same impression of having been selected by somebody with a great deal of money and excellent taste, or at least an excellent decorator. The sturdy oak bookcases that lined the walls held Stephen Strange's entire collection of magical books and journals, as well as everything Wong had managed to add over the past three years. After Tony's workshop, it was probably the largest stockpile of proscribed materials in all of Lowered Manhattan.
Wong sat behind the massive rolltop desk at the back of the room, with several books and one fragile-looking papyrus scroll spread out in front of him. Like Tony, he lit his workspace with jars of glowing beetles -- he didn't like to have candles too close to the books. He'd been immersed in his own research when Steve had come in, but the mention of the Correspondence caused him to immediately put his pen down and give Steve his full attention.
"I've heard of it," he said slowly, "but have never studied it myself. If I recall correctly, it's a written language that has been adopted by the denizens of several Hell dimensions, but is not native to any of them."
"So what is it native to?" Steve asked.
"No one knows." Wong adjusted the wire-rimmed glasses he'd started to wear for reading in the past couple of years. "All I know is, Dr. Strange tried to make a study of it some years ago, using mostly secondary sources, then put it aside. He had a theory that it's sentient, and hostile to humanity."
Steve tried to imagine how that might work, and failed miserably. "How can a language be sentient?"
"You'd be surprised at what unlikely things can be sentient if you know how to recognize them," Wong said wryly. "In any case, I don't know that it's true, only that it's what Dr. Strange believed. What I do know is that scholars who spent too much time examining the Correspondence directly have a way of ending up dead or mad. You were right to get Mr. Stark away from that box."
"Now we just need to make sure he keeps away from it," Steve sighed. "He's asleep upstairs right now, but when he wakes up, tell him what you just told me, will you?" Surely even Tony, with his half-atrophied sense of self-preservation, would know to be wary of hostile sentient languages.
"I'll make it sound very vague and mystical," Wong promised. "That's usually guaranteed to make him stay away in disgust."
"Thanks," Steve said, and went to get changed for his trip Uptown.
The Unfinished Men Steve and Luke had fought the day before would've recovered by now, and reported to their superiors. That meant the Brass Embassy had to know that the Avengers had their mystery box. Going out as Captain America meant inviting trouble not just for himself, but for the Uptowners, whose existence was already precarious enough. Steve hated sneaking around Manhattan as if it were enemy territory instead of home. It seemed like an admission of defeat, somehow. Still, despite frequent accusations to the contrary, he did know when and how to bow to practical necessity. There was more at stake then his pride. So he threw on a leather aviator jacket over jeans and a plain gray sweatshirt, and left his shield behind when he left the house. In the perpetual shadows of Lowered Manhattan, this was as unobtrusive as he was ever likely to get.
No matter how many times he'd done it, that first step through the Sanctum Sanctorum's front door into the street always gave Steve a faint shiver of unease. Wong claimed that he was simply feeling the loss of the magical protections that still clung to the house even after Stephen Strange's death. Steve thought it was the smell. He'd gotten used to the round-the-clock darkness and the muted sounds, to reading by candlelight and doing all his laundry by hand, to car-free streets and darkened billboards in Times Square, to a diet that was ninety percent mushrooms. But the stale, musty air was a forcible reminder that the city wasn't being kept in perpetual night by magic or illusion, it was actually underground, cut off and sealed in. A million and a half people, all buried alive together, and Steve seemed to be the only one still bothered by the thought.
Tony insisted that it was all the same air, indoors and out, and the difference was all in Steve's head. Tony had barely set foot out of the basement in three years, so Steve wasn't inclined to take his opinion for it.
He shoved his hands into his jacket pockets and walked north, keeping a wary eye out for the patrols and checkpoints Natasha had warned about. The streets were a great deal emptier than normal. Apparently, everyone who could was staying indoors for the day. After several blocks, Steve ducked into a small grocery store on MacDougal and bought two loaves of bread and a dozen packets of jerky ("100% local-caught squirrel! No rat, bat or pigeon, guaranteed!") The grocery bag gave him a plausible reason to be outside, and some lucky Uptowner would appreciate the donation.
There were LMPD checkpoints every five or six blocks, and Unfinished Men roamed the streets in packs. Steve had to circle out of his way several times, and occasionally duck into doorways to avoid being seen. Luck was with him, though, or maybe just good timing, and he reached Herald Square unmolested. Now, it was just a matter of going up.
In the days immediately following the Descent, Manhattan's population went through a drastic vertical shift. With no electricity to power the elevators, thousands of people were forced to move downwards, leaving the world of luxury high-rises and multimillion-dollar penthouses to anyone who was willing to make the climb. An entirely new infrastructure sprung up nearly overnight, connecting the higher levels of the city through a network of catwalks, zip lines, and complex rope-and-pulley arrangements. Some of the new Uptowners claimed that they hadn't touched the ground in years.
The Macy's building was one of the central access points -- nowhere near the tallest building in the area, but high enough to make the climb a bit of a challenge. Steve slung his grocery bag onto his shoulder, and took a running leap at the south facade. He used the overhang over the door as a springboard to launch himself still higher, caught the lower edge of a third-floor window with one hand, and free-climbed the rest of the way to the top.
There was a platform mounted on the roof, with dozens of nylon cables fanning out in all directions to connect to the surounding buildings. Some of the cables were thick and sturdy enough for climbing, others were barely thicker than a length of fishing line. Steve grabbed one of thinner cables, tugged once, then three times fast, twice, once, three times again. He waited a minute, repeated the sequence, then settled down with his back to the platform to wait for a response. It took a little over five minutes before one of the sturdier cables began to vibrate, signaling that someone was approaching. A few seconds later, a teenage girl in biker shorts and a baggy sweatshirt rappelled across 35th Street to land in a defensive crouch about six feet in front of Steve.
"Who are you?" The girl's expression was wary but unafraid. She had a knife strapped to her thigh, and what looked like the grip of an aluminum baseball bat protruding from the pack strapped to her back. Steve kept his hands in plain sight and did his best not to look like a threat.
"Captain America," he said. "I'm here to see the Falcon."
The girl's eyes widened a little, but she didn't relax her stance or take her gaze off Steve's empty hands. "Got any proof?" she demanded.
Steve dug his Avengers card from his jacket and held it out. "Is this good enough?"
"M-maybe." The girl folded her arms across her chest and pursed her lips. Steve thought she was trying just a little too hard to look unimpressed. Teenagers had that reaction to him, sometimes. "What do you want with Sam?"
"I'd rather tell him myself. Here." Steve offered her the grocery bag. The bread was a little squashed, but other than that everything was in good shape. "I've brought a donation."
"Hmm." The girl snatched the bag from his hand and examined the contents before stuffing it into her backpack with an approving nod. "Sam's on the East Side today." She leaped up to grab a cable, swung her legs up and over, dangled upside-down as she gave him a wide grin. "If you're really Captain America, you should be able to keep up."
The trip that followed was fairly dizzying, even by Steve's standards. They traveled fifteen blocks in under ten minutes, leaping and swinging in a manner Steve normally associated with Spider-Man. He kept up, though he thought the girl cheated a couple of times, taking shortcuts over supports that wouldn't hold Steve's weight and forcing him to scramble the long way around. By the time they reached their destination, on the roof of what must've once been an incredibly pricey condo tower just north of the UN, he was starting to wish he hadn't worn a jacket.
Unlike the Macy's building, this one clearly wasn't intended as a transportation hub. There were no cables or catwalks connecting to the surrounding roofs; they'd had jto ump ten feet onto a three-inch ledge from a smaller building next door, then scale the wall the rest of the way to the top. Once they got up there, Steve could see the reason for the limited access. The roof was lined with rows of long, narrow boxes holding the fat black mushrooms that had become the city's main food crop. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and mulch. Oyster mushrooms sprouted from straw-filled plastic bags suspended from metal frames, and a row of metal trash cans served as planters for one of the odd underground plants exported by the Brass Embassy, the one with the black leaves and the translucent white berries that tasted like candied ginger. And propped up on poles overhead was a glim net, sagging heavily beneath the weight of glossy, blue-black jewels. This close to the cavern roof, the glim didn't have time to break up as it fell, resulting in larger, more valuable pieces. The contents of that one net could keep a Downtown family comfortably housed and fed for a month, even at the inflated Bazaar prices.
"You'll have to hang here for a while." Steve's guide made a quick round of the mushroom garden, checking the box contents with a critical eye before squatting at the edge of the roof, directly opposite where Steve was standing. "The Falcon patrols this side of town in the mornings, but I can't say for sure when he'll be here." She gripped the edge and let her feet swing down, dangling by her fingertips. "I'll tell him you're waiting if I see him."
"What if he's already come and gone?" Steve asked, but the girl dropped out of sight before he finished getting the words out. By the time he jogged across the roof and looked down, she was shimmying down the wall, five floors below him and at least fifty floors above the street. "Thanks!" Steve called after her, but she didn't look up.
There was nothing left to do but sit and wait again, so Steve sat and waited. This high above the city, the world was eerily silent. The phosphorescent spots on the cavern roof looked almost like stars except that the unfamiliar constellations they formed never changed. Steve found himself drumming his fingers against the side of one of the metal planters, just to have a bit of ordinary noise to ground him.
A series of short, high-pitched hoots in the distance made him rise to his feet and raise one arm in greeting. A few seconds later, the Falcon glided down to a smooth landing on the one corner of the roof that wasn't covered by glim net. Redwing circled overhead, still hooting.
"Cap." The Falcon's wings shimmered out of existence as he stepped forward to shake Steve's hand. "You're not looking like your usual colorful self."
"Unfortunately," Steve said, "my usual colorful self is kind of wanted right now."
"I know." Sam's smile grew a little cooler. "We actually had the LMPD up here, for the first time ever. Asking about you and Luke and Spider-Man. Threatening to arrest us all for not paying taxes on our glim. Good times all around."
"Sorry." Steve winced. "They didn't actually arrest anybody, did they?"
"Nah." Sam shrugged it off. "They knew better than to try, up here. Man, you should've seen all the gear they lugged along, just to get here. You'd think they were going up Everest. I think some of the rookies had parachutes." He barked out a laugh, accompanied by a matching cackle from Redwing. "No, the cops were no trouble. If the devils decide to come calling, though -- that could be a different game." He gave Steve a suspicious look. "Are the devils going to come calling?"
"I don't think so," Steve said. "I mean, no one really knows what they'll do. But I'd say if they haven't come up by now, they probably won't. "
"You'd better be right," Sam said darkly. "Okay, then, if you're not here to bring trouble, then why are you here?"
"I need a favor," Steve said. "And before you ask, yes, it's related to yesterday's business. But it's not something anyone will be able to trace to you."
"Uh-huh," Sam said. Redwing swooped down to sit on his shoulder and fixed Steve with a beady, skeptical glare. "What kind of favor?"
"I need glim," Steve told him. "As much you can spare in the next couple of days."
"Really?" Sam raised his eyebrows, and Redwing gave an amused little chirp. "Normally, when you come around looking for a favor, it's because you want me to do something noble and suicidal with you. Captain America begging for money is a new one on me. What do you need it for?"
"It's a long story," Steve said.
"Great." Sam smirked. "I could use some entertainment on a slow day. Talk."
Steve talked, and Sam's expression grew steadily more grave as he listened. He asked no questions when Steve finished, just shook his head and let out a low whistle.
"Damn. That's a hell of a lot of money to cough up when you don't actually know what you're buying."
"I know." Steve nodded. "But we're kind of in a bind here. Whatever's in that box, the devils and the Masters want it badly. We can't give it to them, not without knowing what's in it, and according to Wong there's no safe way to destroy it or get rid of it. We need to know what's in it before we can clear up this mess."
"Great," Sam said sourly. "You know I can't get you three hundred grand in glim, right? It would take weeks to gather that much, even if I could afford to hand you the entire Uptown harvest over that time. Which I can't."
"I know," Steve said. "I'm only asking for what you can afford to spare. And if there's anything I or the Avengers can do for you in return, just say it."
"Well..." Sam looked thoughtful. "I do have a spot of high-rise construction work going on about fifty blocks north that could use another strong back."
Steve shrugged out of his jacket. "Lead the way."
Six and a half hours later, Steve was enjoying a new and enhanced appreciation of walking on solid ground. The sidewalk on Fifth Avenue was nice and broad. It didn't wobble or sway beneath his weight, and if he accidentally stepped off it, he'd just end up in the street, with nothing worse than a stray rollerblader to worry about. Steve had a good head for heights, but a day spent installing what Sam had called "an Uptown extension" over East Harlem came close to exceeding his tolerance.
He was fairly sure that Sam had drafted him mainly for amusement value. Everyone else on the crew had been a skilled construction worker. They hadn't really needed him. But they'd all seemed glad to have him anyway, and it had felt good to do something physical yet non-violent and immediately useful for a change. For all his worries, Steve found himself feeling fairly cheerful as he walked back to the Sanctum Sanctorum. Naturally, it wasn't meant to last.
There was a checkpoint at 42nd Street, large enough that Steve could see it from three blocks away. He veered west to avoid it, then had to keep going to avoid the LMPD patrols that suddenly seemed to be everywhere. By the time he finally turned south again, he was on the riverfront.
At least there were no patrols there, or any other sign of life, for that matter. Not so much as a sorrow-spider creeping in the shadows. The creatures that lived in New Hudson liked to come ashore sometimes, and they had a habit of eating anything they could get their tentacles on. Even the devils tended to avoid the western riverfront, and all of the city's shipping was done on the east side. Steve found himself flexing his fingers as he walked, his hand itching for the comforting weight of his shield.
"Hold it right there, Rogers!"
Damn. He'd been so focused on the potential dangers from the river that he'd missed the sound of human footsteps half a block away. Trust Maria Hill to patrol where no one else would, and to recognize him across a wide, badly-lit street. There was no place to run, and Steve didn't feel like running anyway. He stopped and waited.
Hill wore her old SHIELD battle uniform under a frayed Army jacket with LMPD patches hand-sewn to her right sleeve and breast pocket. The three officers with her wore similar patchwork uniforms. The LMPD itself was a patchwork, formed from the NYPD, SHIELD and military personnel that got stranded in Lowered Manhattan after the Descent. They did a fine enough job dealing with ordinary day-to-day police work, but in a city where Hell ran the legal system and owning a flashlight was a capital crime, they could never be completely trusted. And Hill in particular was not someone to whom Steve was inclined to give the benefit of the doubt. She had followed some pretty shady orders from pretty shady people even back when she was SHIELD.
He wondered what she was doing here. Hill was one of LMPD's higher-ranking detectives, as well as their liaison to the Brass Embassy. Why was she patrolling the streets like an ordinary beat cop? Then again, the ordinary beat cops were probably busy manning the checkpoints.
"Is there a problem, officer?" Steve asked in his blandest, most innocent tone. Hill's answering scowl could've blistered paint.
"Put your hands on your head." She had her gun drawn, all of them did. This would be a tricky fight if it got that far. Steve stayed where he was, hands at his sides.
"Am I under arrest?"
"I'll let you know in a minute. Put your hands up."
If she patted him down, she'd find his Avengers card, with its hundred-year battery and miniaturized transmitter/receiver. Enough proscribed tech to warrant a hanging, or maybe even something permanent. The Masters could get highly inventive with their execution methods when they thought it was worth the bother.
Not that Steve had any intention of letting himself be arrested. "Is this what the LAPD does now? Harass random pedestrians? No wonder you took to the job so well, Hill."
"Shut up," Hill growled. "I have sworn statements from two witnesses saying you made off with Embassy property yesterday. You're lucky I don't arrest you on the spot."
"What witnesses? Unfinished Men?" Steve rolled his eyes. "So well known for their upright moral character. Even the devils won't admit their testimony in court."
"We're not in court." Hill took a step toward him, gun still raised. "For the last time, put your hands up."
The other three officers were fanning out behind her, covering Steve from three sides. Not from the river side, though -- none of them were willing to turn their backs on that black water. That gave him a direction to retreat in, provided he didn't mind getting wet. And possibly eaten. And if Hill got close to him, she'd be in the line of fire, enough to make the others hold their shots for a few moments. He could make this work. Steve raised his arms and clasped his hands together at the back of his neck.
Hill finally holstered her gun to frisk him. She was quick and efficient about it, patting him down from shoulder to ankle, tossing his matches and his Swiss army knife to the ground as she went through his pockets. When she reached the inside chest pocket on his jacket, she paused, fingers tracing the edges of the Avengers card through the cloth. Steve tensed, ready to make a grab. The thought of taking a hostage left a foul taste in his mouth, but it would only be for a few seconds, just enough to get him in position to jump. He was almost ready--
"He's clean." Hill stepped back, sounding thoroughly annoyed with the universe. "Everyone stand down."
Steve lowered his arms, trying to look less confused than he felt. Hill had the excuse to arrest him literally at her fingertips, and she was backing off. What was the point of the whole exercise if she wasn't going to follow through?
"Here's the deal, Rogers." Hill's voice was ice-cold. "The devils want their property back, and they don't care how they get it. They'll tear the city apart if they have to, but there's no reason why they should have to. If that box surfaced again -- in an anonymous package, maybe, or a lost and found office at a police station -- then they'd be satisfied. No questions asked, no further trouble. You have my word on it."
Ah. That's what the point was. Maria Hill's notion of a good will gesture. She could've arrested him, and she didn't, and now he was supposed to trust her.
Steve wasn't impressed.
"The devils are going to just back off and play nice? Forgive me if I don't just take you word on that."
Hill's right hand twitched toward her holstered gun, then clenched into a fist and remained at her side.
"You don't have a choice," she said flatly. "Or maybe you do, if you're willing to keep hiding behind Wong's apron while the city is torn apart around you."
"Fine words," Steve said, "from someone who's doing the tearing. Last time I checked, it was your people running the checkpoints and making the mass arrests, Hill."
"Would you rather the Unfinished Men do it?" Hill demanded. "They don't make arrests, and they don't ask questions either, they just crack heads. At least when I and my men stop somebody, we let them go in one piece when we're done."
"I'll remember that," Steve said, "next time there's a round of executions in Embassy Square."
"Look." Hill stepped even closer, and pitched her voice low enough so that only Steve could hear it. "I don't actually give a shit what you think about me. But think about this: the only reason the devils haven't shown up at your front door to reclaim that fucking box is because they don't know where you live. I do know, and I haven't told them, just as I haven't told anyone about that contraband tech in your pocket. You can hate me all you want, but you still need to trust me, because things can get a lot worse than they are now."
"It never works, you know," Steve told her. Hill glared at him with wide, furious eyes.
"What doesn't work?"
"Collaborating." Steve didn't bother to keep his voice low. Let the other officers hear, they were in it too. "I've seen it a hundred times, all through the war. You think you're preventing the greater evil by going along with the small ones. You think you're being pragmatic, and reasonable, and doing what has to be done. But the small evils pave the way for the greater one, and when it happens, you'll be right in the middle of it, wondering how your hands got so filthy. You may think it'll be somehow different for you, but it won't be. This is what happens. This is how it works."
From the look on Hill's face, Steve thought she might forget about the gun and go for his throat with her bare hands, but apparently the SHIELD training held. She reined in her temper and stayed where she was.
"You have no idea how it works," she hissed at him, "or what I've prevented while you sat around composing pretty speeches. You want to despise me for what I'm doing, fine. What have you done these past three years, Captain America?" She spun around and walked away from without waiting for an answer, gesturing for her men to follow. "You have my offer!" She called out without turning to look at him as she crossed the street. "It's your call now."
Steve waited until they were all out of sight before he gathered his belongings from the ground and began walking himself. His earlier cheerful mood was completely gone, replaced by tension and futile anger. Encounters with Hill always had a bad effect on his temper, and this time was made worse by the fact that he had no good answer for her final question. What have you done for the past three years, Captain America? The answer was, precious little. The Avengers had devoted most of their resources to searching for ways to return Manhattan to its proper time and place, and so far they had nothing to show for it. And without that one all-important thing, everything else they did was a band-aid on a gut wound.
It was a long, plodding walk back to Bleecker Street. By the time he reached the Sanctum Sanctorum, all Steve wanted was food and sleep, in no particular order. But all thoughts of rest vanished when a pale-faced Jessica Drew met him at the door.
"Tony's gone," she announced, before Steve could even begin to ask what was wrong.
"He's what?" Steve felt suddenly cold. "What do you mean gone?"
"Gone from the house," Wong said, walking into the foyer behind Jessica. "No word to anyone. We don't even know exactly when he left."
Steve couldn't even remember the last time Tony had left the house. "Where could he possibly go?"
"I don't know," Wong said grimly. "But he took the box with him."
Chapter 4
The cabinet in the workshop was wide open, the padlock left on the floor in pieces next to the bolt cutters Tony had used to remove it. Aside from the box, nothing seemed to be missing, but then again, Tony was the only one who had the complete inventory.
"I should've known." Steve picked up the broken lock and dropped it on the table, resisting the childish urge to hurl it at the wall. "Should've known it was too easy when he locked it up of his own free will... How long has he been gone? Has anyone talked to him?"
"I did," Wong said. "He came into the library to ask if I'd made any progress, and I told him about the Correspondence. He did his usual grumbling about magic, then left. That was about two hours ago."
"I heard the generator going," Jessica offered. "About an hour ago, when I came down to the storeroom for some candles. It's off now, so he must've shut it down before he left."
None of the other Avengers had seen or heard Tony all day, which was hardly unusual. If he hadn't left the front door ajar when he walked out, they might not have noticed him missing at all.
An hour or less. He could've gone anywhere in an hour. It was certainly more than enough time to run into a checkpoint or get picked up by a patrol. Steve's imagination was all too ready to paint grisly images of what the Unfinished Men might do to Tony if they found him wandering the streets with the box.
"All right, let's try and think about this from Tony's point of view. Why did he leave in the first place? Where would he go?"
"The Brass Embassy," Wong said. "Or possibly the Library." When everyone turned to look at him, he shrugged and spread his hands. "I doubt Mr. Stark wandered off on his own whim. He knows how dangerous it is out there. The box -- or rather, the Correspondence written on the box -- must be influencing him somehow, and the box is devil-made. My guess is, they designed it to want to return to them if stolen."
That sounded... terrifyingly plausible. Steve closed his eyes for a moment and tried to will himself into calmness. It wasn't an entirely successful effort, but at least he managed to speak without shouting.
"All right then, let's assume Tony is headed north. If we move quickly -- " and if he hasn't gotten himself killed yet -- "we may catch up to him."
Three minutes later, Steve and Luke were headed north on Sixth Avenue, while Wong and Peter took MacDougal and both Jessicas scouted ahead by air. Steve wished they weren't so short-handed, wished they had a quick way of locating Black Widow, or Daredevil, or the Falcon. They had no way of knowing what Tony was thinking or what the Correspondence was telling him. He might've headed for the nearest checkpoint to turn himself in, or he might be taking a roundabout route and trying to avoid being seen. The Avengers needed to cover as much ground as they could, and at the moment it wasn't much.
"Cap." Luke grabbed Steve's shoulder and pulled him to a halt as he pointed toward an overturned trashcan a few paces ahead of them. The streetlight at the corner wasn't quite bright enough to dispel the shadows around the can, and it took Steve a moment to realize that the small gray lump nestled among the spilled trash was actually a sleeping cat, curled up with its tail wrapped around its paws.
"You want to do the honors?" Luke whispered, "or should I?"
"My boots are quieter." Steve inched forward a step. "Stand by to grab if I miss, though."
The cat's ears twitched a little as he tiptoed toward it, but Steve held his breath and kept moving until he was close enough to drop to his knees and grab. The cat woke with a yowl and a great deal of violent thrashing, but Steve had a good hold on it by then. He cradled the hissing beast firmly against his chest as he climbed to his feet. The cat snagged its hind claws in the fabric of his sweatshirt, made one last attempt to wriggle free, then abruptly went limp in Steve's grip.
"The sixth alphabet of Hell is the alphabet of wards and barriers," it hissed resentfully.
"Thank you," Steve said in his most polite tone. "But I'm not actually looking for secrets right now." He shifted his hold and attempted a gentle rub behind the cat's ears. It craned its neck around to glare at him, its yellow eyes expressing deep contempt.
"What do you want, then?"
"A friend of mine is missing," Steve said. "He might've passed this way in the last hour or so. Human, about my height but thinner, black ha-- black fur on his head and face. He's carrying a metal box, a little smaller than you are. If you help us find him, my friends and I will owe you a favor."
"What makes you think I care for human favors?" the cat growled, but its eyes narrowed to slits, and the expression on its face -- as far as a cat could be judged to have expressions -- shifted from derisive to calculating. Steve waited in silence, doing his best to project an air of respectful calm. It was difficult. Every second he stood there was another second for Tony to get farther away and deeper into trouble. But cats couldn't be rushed or bullied into cooperating, they could only be persuaded. So he waited, and eventually the cat let out a half-hearted purr and butted its head against his chest.
"I saw a black-furred human like the one you describe," it admitted, "before I fell asleep. He went into the below place."
"The below place?" Steve repeated blankly. The cat bristled its whiskers and twitched one paw northward, where a pair of unlit globe lamps flanked the entrance to the West 4th Street station.
"He's gone into the subway?" Luke sounded as appalled as Steve felt. Short of throwing himself head-first into New Hudson, it was the most suicidal thing Tony could've done.
"Below place. Spider country." The cat twisted free of Steve's slackened grip and darted into the shadows. Steve took a stumbling step toward the subway entrance, but Luke grabbed his arm.
"Hold it, Cap. We can't just go running in there."
"Tony is--"
"I know," Luke said. "But if we're going to go down after him, we'll need light. And weapons. And back-up."
Luke was right. More to the point, Luke was saying what Steve himself should've been saying if he'd been thinking clearly. This was no way to run a rescue mission. Steve mentally shoved aside the nightmare images of Tony's eyeless corpse, and reached for his communicator.
"Avengers assemble."
Light was the tricky part. A search of Tony's workshop turned up a propane lantern but no fuel, and six flashlights, only two of which had functioning batteries. Jessica Jones wrinkled her nose in disgust as she filled old pickle jars with glowing beetles and screwed on the lids.
"I hate these things," she muttered, shaking a couple of stray beetles from her sleeve. "All those creepy legs."
"You think those are creepy," Luke said, "wait till we get to the sorrow-spiders."
Jessica glared as she shoved a jar into his hands. "Not helping, dear."
"So," Peter said, "do we actually have a plan? Or are we just going to wander around in the dark until our eyeballs get eaten?"
"We'll go in two groups," Steve said as he hefted his shield. "One flier in each group for advance scouting. If Wong's theory is right and Tony's taking the most direct route north, then he'll most likely be in one of the Sixth Avenue tunnels, so we'll check those first."
"Right." Peter nodded sagely. "Wander in the dark until our eyeballs get eaten it is, then."
The Lowered Manhattan City Council, elected six months after the Descent and mostly ignored by the real powers that ran the city, had an ongoing project in place, slowly bricking up all the subway entrances and exits. They hadn't gotten around to West 4th Street yet; the entrance on Sixth Avenue was piled high with sandbags and draped in yellow police tape. It didn't entirely keep the sorrow-spiders in -- there were too many ventilation ducts and access tunnels around for that -- but it did, for the most part, keep the humans out. The popular consensus was that anyone who actually made the effort to get past the barriers deserved their fate.
So what does that make us? Steve wondered as he made his way down the stairs.
Some of the sandbags had been pulled out, leaving a gap just large enough for a grown man to squeeze through. Which also made it large enough for a decent-sized spider. Steve hoped not too many had gotten out in the hour or so since Tony opened the way. Even more, he hoped that Tony still retained enough of his right mind to take a weapon and a light with him when he left the house.
"We'd better close the hole behind us when we go in," he said. "No need to let any more of these things out into the streets."
"Great." Peter shot out a web to pull one of the shifted bags back into place. "There's nothing I love more than entering a black pit of crawling horror and blocking my escape route behind me."
The air on the mezzanine level smelled of mold and rot. The beam of Steve's flashlight picked out cobwebs smothering every inch of the walls in a thick gray layer. More webs clung to his boots as he walked, and hung from the ceiling like shredded drapes. They made for slow, sticky going, but there was an unexpected benefit to them: Tony's earlier progress left a clearly visible trail. Maybe they wouldn't have to split up after all.
"Everyone stick close." Steve shifted to a fighting grip on his shield as he moved toward the stairs. "We can follow the--"
A faint skittering sound was the only warning he got before the spiders leaped from the shadows.
There were at least a dozen of them, maybe more. Steve couldn't judge the number in the dark, not when they were moving so fast. The one that went for his face was the size of a large cat, and Steve thought he could hear its mandibles clicking as it leaped toward him. He got the shield up just in time. The spider smacked into it with a thud and dropped to the floor, where it immediately launched itself at Steve's ankles. Steve brought the shield down edge first, decapitating the beast just as its fangs grazed his boot. Thick, foul-smelling goo splattered the floor, sizzling where it hit. The body's legs were still twitching when Steve kicked it aside.
"Cap, get down!" Luke shouted behind him. Steve dropped into a crouch, and a length of chain sailed over his head to knock another spider out of the air before it could land on top of him. There was no time for thanks -- two more were already attacking. Steve sprang back up and swung his shield again.
It was hard to tell how everyone else was doing, in the chaos of jumping shadows and small, bobbing light sources. The dark blur on Steve's left appeared to be Wong, fighting with a staff. The fast-moving shadow on the left had to be Peter. Jewel and Spider-Woman were presumably in flight and Luke was somewhere behind him. No one sounded in obvious distress, so Steve focused on his own opponents and kept fighting.
He took down three more, glanced around for the next one, and realized no more were coming. Around him, the battle wound down as the rest of the Avengers ran out of things to fight. There were crushed and dismembered spider carcasses everywhere, and dark puddles on the floor. Steve's shield looked nearly black from all the spider-blood smeared on it, and his boots and jeans were liberally splattered with the stuff. Post-battle laundry day was going to be a hell of a party.
"Is anyone hurt?" Steve called out.
"Nah." Luke coiled his chain around his arm again. "Just really grossed out. You okay, honey?"
"Ugh." Jewel landed next to him. "That stuff is in my hair."
"I'd like to state for the record," Peter said, "that these things are no relation whatsoever. Also, judging all arachnids by the actions of a few extremists would be bad and wrong. Right, Jess?"
"I'd like to state for the record," Spider-Woman grumbled, "that he's no relation, either."
"This can't be all of them." Steve turned in a slow circle, aiming his light at the darkest corners of mezzanine, but saw no sign of movement. "They're probably regrouping. We need to move."
The fight had wiped out a large portion of Tony's trail, but they picked it up again at the turnstiles and followed it to the staircase leading down to the Sixth Avenue Express platform. The cobwebs grew thicker as they moved further inside the station, and the smell of rot became stronger. Small lumps tangled in some of the thicker strands turned out to be rat corpses when Steve took a closer look. Faint scratching sounds in the darkness indicated that the Avengers were being watched, but nothing jumped out to attack them.
The farther they went, the more uneasy Steve felt. Why weren't they being attacked? It occurred to him that they didn't really know how intelligent the spiders were. Could they plan an ambush? He aimed his flashlight onto the stairs in front of him. The stairwell was so choked with webbing that he could only see a few feet in. Now that he'd thought of it, it was an excellent place for an ambush, a confined space with low visibility and awkward footing. But Tony's smudged footprints were visible on the top steps, which meant they had to follow. Steve brushed the nearest cobwebs aside and started down the stairs.
The walls in the stairwell looked different than the walls on the mezzanine, oddly rippled rather than smooth. Steve raised his flashlight for a better look, and realized that the layer of webbing that covered the tile had numerous small spheres embedded in it, clumped together like clusters of some bizarre fruit.
"Ugh." Spider-Woman poked at one of the clusters, then jerked her hand back. "Are these their eggs?"
"No." Wong sounded sick. "They're eyes. Human eyes."
"What?" Steve moved the flashlight closer, then had to stagger back a step and swallow the rising bile in his throat. Wong was right. Those were human eyeballs in the webs. Hundreds of them.
What the hell is going on here? They'd always assumed that sorrow-spiders ate the eyes of their victims. The thought was horrible enough in and of itself. But this-- were they storing their food for later? Or--
"Oh, shit..." Peter said in a strangled voice. "It's hatching."
One of the eyeballs burst open with a barely audible pop. A baby spider the size of a small marble wriggled out, dripping fluids, and disappeared into the depths of the webbing. Someone let out a stifled gagging sound. Steve couldn't tell who it was, but he shared the sentiment.
They needed to find Tony now. Needed to bring him home alive and whole, and then they needed to come back here and torch the place.
Something moved on the staircase below them, claws clicking on concrete. The cobwebs shifted, and a light bobbed near the bottom step, then moved toward them.
"Something's coming," Steve hissed, and readied his shield.
A spider emerged from the shadows and crouched on the lowest step illuminated by Steve's flashlight. Its body was nearly three feet high, and its legs spanned the full width of the stairwell. A dozen unblinking eyes the size of silver dollars regarded Steve with unnerving intelligence. Dangling from its mandibles was a narrow strap with a small but bright LED light clipped onto it. Steve felt a sick jolt of fear. He'd seen Tony wear that headband in the workshop more times than he could count.
He lurched forward a step, and the spider skittered backwards. It stopped when he stopped, waited, then raised one claw-tipped leg and crooked it in an awkward but unmistakable beckoning motion.
"Great," Luke muttered. "It wants us to follow it."
"Of course it does." Peter sounded resigned. "And I'm sure it's totally not a trap at all."
They followed, of course. What choice did they have? Their guide led them onto the express platform, then down onto the uptown track and into the tunnel. More spiders watched from the walls and ceiling, nestled in the clear spaces between the eyeball clusters. A few of the younger, rat-sized ones darted back and forth between the rails. There had to be several hundred spiders, just within the limited range of the Avengers' lights. Steve tried not to think of what would happen if they all attacked at once.
"More humans?" A smooth, surprisingly pleasant voice murmured from the shadows. "What an unexpected abundance of guests we have today. I suppose it's an honor."
"Who's there?" Spiders darted out of the way as Steve advanced deeper into the tunnel. Was he imagining things, or was the darkness directly ahead of him somehow blacker and... more solid than it had been before? Something blocked the way ahead of him, a pulsing, misshapen bulk the size of an SUV. The guide spider scurried toward it, still clutching Tony's stolen light in its jaws, and the added illumination finally allowed Steve to see what he was facing off against.
He'd been expecting a single giant spider. But the thing in front of him was made up of at least a dozen spiders, all fused together into a single lumpy mass. Legs sprouted from the beast's sides and back. Hundreds of eyes looked in all directions. Venom dripped from at least six sets of fangs that Steve could see from where he was standing. Smaller spiders gathered around its lower legs, clicking their mandibles in a burst of nervous chatter as Steve moved closer.
"What are you?" he demanded.
"We are the Spider Council." The compound body rippled slightly as it spoke. The silky contralto voice sounded disturbingly human. "We would ask why you invade our home, but we suppose it's obvious enough. You've come for this, yes?" It made a series of rapid-fire clicking sounds, dozens of jaws moving at once. The guide spider moved sideways, and Steve saw Tony, on his knees in the narrow gap between the wall and the Council's body.
Tony's clothes were torn and filthy, and his face was smeared with blood from a ragged gash on his left cheek. He was clutching the box to his chest and rocking from side to side, his gaze fixed on some far-off point.
"Tony!" Steve called sharply, and Tony turned, but it seemed to be just an instinctive response to a loud noise. If he recognized Steve, or any of the other Avengers, he showed no sign of it.
"He can't hear you." The Council sounded amused. "The Correspondence is singing to him, and he's deaf to all other voices."
"Let him go," Steve said. "It's the box you want, right? You can have it, then. You don't need him." They could come back for the box later, when Tony was safe. Now that they knew exactly what they were dealing with, they could plan their attack better...
"Ah, but we do need him." The Council reached down with one of its side legs and curled it tenderly around Tony's throat. Tony didn't seem to notice. "We need them both. A human whose eyes have been marked by the Correspondence... We had begun to think that this city would never produce one, that we would be the last of the Spider Councils. Alas, this one has not been marked enough yet." It tightened its hold and pulled Tony closer, pressing his back against its side. "We'll make you a deal, humans. You cannot kill us, and you won't leave here without our permission, but we're prepared to be generous. Go, and leave your companion here. We'll take good care of him while continues his study of the Correspondence. And once he's been sufficiently marked, we'll take what we need and return him you."
"Take what you need. Right." Steve suppressed a shudder. "You mean his eyes."
"We only need one." The Council lowered another leg and tapped the tip of a curved black claw against Tony's temple. He didn't even flinch. "Surely that's a small price to pay for life and safety?"
The other Avengers would be in position behind him by now. Steve couldn't risk a glance back to check on them, but after three years of teamwork he had a good idea of where everyone would be.
"Peter?" He whispered.
"I'm set." Peter's answering whisper came from behind him and to the left, right where he needed to be. "Would be nice if you could move about two feet forward."
"No problem." Steve took a step, and tipped his head back to glare up at the Council. "No deal," he said loudly.
The Council let out another burst of angry clicks. "We told you, you have no choice."
"If that's true, then why are you bothering to talk to us?" Steve shifted his weight forward. "Now, Peter!"
Two web lines shot out from behind him. One snagged the spider leg around Tony's throat and jerked it back, the other one caught Tony himself. Tony dropped like a dead weight when Peter started to pull him in, but didn't let go of the box. There was no time to stop and see how he was, or to help Peter. The Spider Council was charging like an angry rhino, and the other spiders were streaming from the walls and dropping from the ceiling. Steve tightened his grip on the shield, ran forward, and leaped.
He landed on the Council's back facing away from the main battle, but it hardly mattered anyhow. The thing had eyes and fangs everywhere. The topmost legs tried to stab Steve with their claws. He kicked them aside, and brought the shield down with all his strength, aiming for what looked as if it might be a joint between two fused spider bodies. The shield sank deep with a sickening wet sound. Steve pulled it back and struck again, and again.
Spiders dropped onto him from above, too many to avoid or kick aside. Steve felt a sharp, burning pain in his shoulder, then in his knee. There was nothing to be done about it, so he ignored it and kept fighting. Then Spider-Woman was there, blasting the ceiling and making the spiders there scatter. Steve acknowledged the help with a quick lift of his arm, then smashed his shield down again.
The Council lurched forward, suddenly off-balance. Steve had to drop to one knee to keep from being thrown off. He risked a quick look down, and saw the Luke was pummeling the Council from below, while Jewel and Peter attacked from the sides. Wong and Tony were nowhere to be seen. Steve decided to take that as a good sign.
"Tiiiiimberrrrrr!" Peter anchored a web line to the Council's side and pulled. Luke and Jewel helped it along with a flurry of blows, while Steve kept striking from above. The Council let out a high-pitched wail and shuddered so violently, Steve nearly lost his footing again. When he felt it start to topple, he leaped.
It was hard to judge in the dark, but he managed to miss the ceiling, and to twist just enough in mid-air to be on his feet and facing the right way when he landed. The impact sent a stab of pain through his right knee where he'd been bitten earlier, but he stayed upright and lifted the shield again, ready to keep fighting.
There was no need. The Council was still twitching and waving its legs around, but the movements were clearly death throes. Gray ichor oozed from dozens of wounds, and the clicking of its fangs was growing fainter. Around it, the other spiders drew back, as if unsure of what to do next.
"Great," Luke panted. "I declare victory. Can we leave now?"
"Where's Tony?" Steve demanded.
"Up here!" Wong yelled from the platform above.
"See?" Peter pointed in the general direction of Wong's voice. "Everyone accounted for. I'm with Luke -- can we please, please go now?"
"Yeah," Steve said. "We can go."
Chapter 5
Tony wasn't waking up.
Or maybe "waking up" wasn't the right phrase for it, since he didn't actually appear to be asleep. His eyes were open, and he showed a limited awareness of his surroundings, flinching away from bright light and starting at loud noises. But his eyes were dull and unfocused, and he didn't seem to recognize Steve or anyone else around him, or to know where he was.
He also kept climbing out of bed and trying to go downstairs, presumably because downstairs was where the box was. Tony was no more lucid when walking than when lying down, but he was damned persistent. After his third try, Wong cut a towel into strips and tied Tony's wrists to the bed frame. Steve dragged a recliner into the room and settled down to keep watch, to ensure Tony didn't hurt himself trying to break free.
"It's the Correspondence," Wong said. "It's still affecting him."
Tony was in one of the third-floor bedrooms. The box was down in the basement. Wong had chalked protective sigils around Tony's bed and on the walls. If all this wasn't enough to protect him, then what was?
"There has to be something else we could do." Steve bit his lip and shifted restlessly in his chair. The spider bites on his leg and shoulder felt like hot needles digging into his skin. Wong had applied a poultice to each bite to draw out the venom and keep the swelling down, but at the end of the day, the only reliable cure for sorrow-spider bites was time and patience. Steve was feeling critically short of both at the moment.
"Maybe if we moved the box even farther away from him. Give it to Natasha for safekeeping." He didn't like the thought of fobbing the danger off onto someone else, but if anyone could deal with it, the Black Widow could.
"We could try it." Wong didn't sound very optimistic. "But I suspect that at this point, the connection between his mind and the Correspondence is too strong to be undone by mere physical distance. We need to find a way to break the link." He crouched next to Tony's bed and examined the chalk marks on the floor with a critical eye. "There are stronger spells I could try, but they might do more harm than good. We have no information on how the Correspondence responds to human magic, or what it might do to if it feels threatened. It might kill Tony rather than let him go, and it might be powerful enough to make the death permanent." He wouldn't quite meet Steve's eyes as he spoke, but the thought he was trying to hide was clear enough. The Correspondence might be killing Tony already.
"Don't do it yet," Steve said. "Not until we've tried everything else."
"What we need," Wong sighed, "is a trustworthy devil. But I suppose that's a contradiction in terms."
"I've certainly never met one," Steve said. "Anyway, what could a devil do that you can't, with all of Strange's library at your disposal?"
Wong shook his head. "The devils have specialized knowledge. They're on good terms with the Correspondence, they've incorporated it into their writing and into their system of magic. Presumably, they have methods for warding against it."
"The sixth alphabet," Steve blurted out. Wong abandoned his inspection of the wards to give him a startled look.
"Captain?"
"That's what the cat told me yesterday, when I first picked it up." Steve frowned, trying to recall the exact details. "The sixth alphabet of Hell is the alphabet of wards and barriers. I'm pretty sure that's what it said. Is that helpful?"
"It could be." Wong leaped to his feet, looking much the way Tony did -- or used to -- when he made some exciting technological breakthrough. "I have notes on several of the alphabets, including the sixth. I'd never fully deciphered it, but knowing specifically what it's for makes a great deal of difference. If you'll excuse me--" he bolted out the door.
Steve slumped down in his chair and tried to resign himself to waiting. He hated this feeling of uselessness, of having nothing to fight and no immediate goal to strive toward. He almost wished he was back in the subways, battling the spiders again. Then, at least, he'd felt as if he was accomplishing something. And any number of spider bites would be preferable to watching Tony thrash around on the bed, whimpering in distress and fighting against the restraints.
"Tony?" He leaned across the narrow gap between chair and bed, and pressed one hand against Tony's chest. Tony was fever-hot, his face flushed and his t-shirt damp with sweat. His heartbeat was alarmingly rapid beneath Steve's palm. "Tony, if you can hear me at all... please come back."
Tony's breath hitched in a painful-sounding gasp. He strained his arms against the bindings hard enough to make the bed frame creak, then abruptly went limp.
"Let go," he panted. It was the first coherent thing he'd said since they brought him home from the subway ten hours before.
"Tony?" Steve scrambled out of the chair, barely noticing the stab of pain as his injured knee hit the floor. For a second, he thought he saw a flash of awareness in Tony's eyes. But it vanished as quickly as it came, or maybe Steve had imagined it in the first place. Tony's gaze was blank and distant again, and his arms rested limply at his sides.
"Dammit." Steve clenched his hands around the edge of the mattress until his fingers ached. "What's wrong with you, Tony? Where's that famous Tony Stark stubbornness? You never pay attention when I try to talk sense to you. You mouth off to gods and alien invaders and congressional subcommittees. But some stupid magic box starts talking to you, and suddenly you listen? Tell it to go to hell, you're good at that."
Tony flinched as if in pain, but made no sound.
Steve slumped forward to rest his forehead against the edge of the mattress next to Tony's shoulder. He felt drained and hopeless and -- no point in denying it, not to himself -- afraid. This was far from the first time he'd kept vigil at Tony's bedside, not knowing if his best friend would live or die, but apparently he'd reached his limit. The thought of being stuck in this sunless subterranean world without Tony was too bleak to bear.
"Come on, Shellhead." Steve tried to force a laugh, but managed only a loud, half-strangled breath. "You and I are the only founding Avengers left in this town. That means we stick together, right? You can't leave me here alone." He wrapped one hand around Tony's forearm, just above his bound wrist. "Do you hear me? Don't leave, Tony. I can't do this without you."
The door opened with a barely-audible creak. Someone cleared their throat. Steve looked up to see Jessica Jones watching him from the doorway with a disturbingly understanding look in her eyes.
"Uhm, hi." She licked her lips and gave him a small, nervous smile. "I was going to ask if you wanted me to sit with Tony for a while so you could get some rest, but I can see that you don't."
"Thank you." Steve felt his face grow warm as he realized how he must look, kneeling there at Tony's bedside, practically weeping into the sheets like a hero in a Victorian melodrama. He stood up, and did his best to look calm and steady. "I'm fine here."
"Yeah, I can see you're doing great." Jessica stepped back into the hallways and started to pull the door closed, then paused. "It'll be all right," she said. "Wong is in the library right now, muttering in tongues to himself. He'll figure something out."
"I'm sure he will." Steve hoped he sounded confident rather than desperate. Jessica gave him another smile and shut the door. Steve sank back into his chair, but found himself fidgeting, unable to make even a pretense of rest. After half an hour of jumping every time Tony moved or made a sound, he gave in to impulse and moved from the chair to the floor, leaning sideways to lean his head on Tony's arm. It wasn't exactly a comfortable position, but the contact made him feel better. It seemed to settle Tony a little, too. At least, he stopped thrashing around quite so much, even if he still occasionally flexed his hands and muttered "Let go" in a ragged voice. Eventually, Steve closed his eyes and drifted into a restless half-sleep.
He woke to the sound of the door opening again. Wong came in, with a book clutched in one hand and a tray balanced on the other.
"Captain? Is everything all right?"
"For relative values of 'all right,' yes." Steve braced one hand against the bed and hauled himself to his feet. He wasn't sure how much time had passed, but the crick in his neck suggested several hours spent in the same position. "Did you find something?"
"I have." Wong set the tray down on the dresser. "Something worth trying, anyway."
The tray held a porcelain bowl filled with dark-green liquid, and a small paintbrush. The book looked old, with a frayed leather binding and thick vellum pages yellowed at the corners. Wong held it open to a page filled with strange-looking geometric hieroglyphs and chaotic margin notes in several different handwritings.
"This is the sixth alphabet. And this--" Wong tapped a fingertip against a line in the middle of the page, "--appears to be the sequence for shielding the mind against magical influence." He turned the book sideways and frowned at one of the margin notes. "Or possibly shielding the lungs against sulfur fumes. Secondary sources differ."
"Is it safe?" Steve demanded. Wong spread his hands.
"As safe as anything originating in Hell can be. The ink I've prepared has certain protective properties that should minimize the danger. But at this point, anything we do is going to carry a certain amount of risk, including doing nothing at all."
Well, that's comforting. Steve reached down and brushed his fingers against Tony's cheek. Was it his imagination, or was Tony's fever getting higher? The heat radiating from his skin couldn't be natural. He'd burn up from the inside if they didn't do something to stop it.
"How do we make it work?"
"From what I've gathered," Wong said, "the glyphs must be drawn directly on the skin. The first one here goes on the pulse points over the wrists, the second one over the solar plexus, and the third to center of the forehead. I understand you're a good hand with a paintbrush, so perhaps you should do the application."
"Right," Steve sighed. "Help me get that t-shirt off him."
Tony began to struggle as soon they untied him, but he was too weak to put up a real fight, and it only took a minute before exhaustion got the better of him. Wong pinned him down while Steve sat on the edge of the bed with the book open in his lap, and painted the first glyph on Tony's left wrist. The ink in the bowl had a musty herbal scent, and dried almost instantly, sometimes clumping on the brush before Steve had time to apply it to skin. Steve worked as quickly as he could without sacrificing precision, while Tony kept chanting let go let go let go under his breath. The words slowly trailed off into indistinct muttering, and by the time Steve finished the design on Tony's right wrist, Tony was still and silent. Steve hoped that was a good sign.
Tony didn't react at all when Steve began to trace the second symbol on his chest. The ink lines obscured the pale pockmarks of old shrapnel wounds as well as the darker, more recent scars of more heart surgeries than Steve cared to think about. For the first time, he considered how lucky they'd been that Tony hadn't developed any new and exciting health problems in the years since the Descent. Medicine in Lowered Manhattan had reverted to a step above leeches and mustard plasters, and natural illness was one of the few things that killed permanently. Steve's brush hand faltered for a moment, before he pushed the thought away and forced himself to focus.
The final symbol was the simplest -- just a few short strokes precisely placed. Steve brushed Tony's hair out of the way and painted it on, then dropped the brush back on the tray and closed the book.
"How will we know it's working?" He asked. "Will he just wake up?"
Wong shrugged. "We'll know when it happens."
For a few seconds, nothing happened at all. Then Tony blinked, lifted his head from the pillow, and said "Steve..." in a hoarse, breathless voice.
"Hey!" Steve grabbed Tony's hand. He was pretty sure he was grinning like an idiot, but given the circumstances, he figured he had a good excuse. "You with us again?"
"Steve!" Tony repeated, more urgently this time, and tried to sit up. He made it about half-way before collapsing again. "It's not safe! You have to lock it up, don't let anyone look at it, it's not--"
"We know." Steve gripped Tony's shoulders and held him down as firmly as he could without hurting him. The last thing they needed now was for Tony to rub all the ink off in a struggle. "It's okay, Tony, we know, we've got the box locked away from everyone. You're the only one who's been affected."
"Oh. Good." Tony stopped straining against Steve's hold, and let his head fall back onto the pillow. The panicked expression on his face shifted to confusion. He lifted one arm to examine his wrist, then tucked his chin down to peer at his chest. "Huh. You really did paint on me. I thought I was hallucinating."
"I didn't think you'd noticed." Steve clasped Tony's hand. "You were so out of it."
"They're protective symbols," Wong said, "designed to shield you from the influence of the Correspondence."
"Well, they're working." Tony gave Wong a shaky smile. "Thank you."
"You're quite welcome." Wong cast a thoughtful glance at Steve and Tony's clasped hands as he gathered up the ink bowl tray and the book. "I... should go put these away now." He hurried from the room before Steve had a chance to add his own thanks.
"How do you feel?" Steve asked. Tony's hand already felt cooler against his, as if the fever was receding along with the Correspondence's hold.
"A hell of a lot better than I did an hour ago." Tony sounded tired. "You know what I really, really hate?"
"Magic?" Steve guessed.
"That too." Tony winced. "But right now, what I really, really hate is being mind-controlled. And being mind-controlled by magic, that's a double whammy right there. Remind me to never do that again, okay?"
"Like you ever listen to me." The words came out more harshly than Steve intended. He'd made to sound lighthearted, but the memory of Tony kneeling empty-eyed at the Spider Council's feet was too fresh.
"You'd be surprised." Tony looked away for a moment, then turned to face Steve again. "I could hear you, you know. When you were talking to me earlier."
"You could?" Steve blinked at him. "I thought you could only hear the Correspondence."
"At first, yeah." Tony shivered a little. "Everything else was just white noise. It wanted me to bring the box to the Brass Embassy, and it was... very, very insistent. I never even thought about disobeying until I heard you saying my name, and then I couldn't-- I tried, but it-- it wouldn't let go."
"I'm sorry," Steve said. Tony shrugged.
"Hey, you did tell me to keep away from that damned box. Here's your chance to say you told me so."
"I don't want a chance to say I told you so!" Steve tried to speak calmly, but he seemed to have no control over his own voice anymore. Every word came out a little shakier, and a little louder than the one before. "I could happily go the rest of my life without needing to say I told you so. I want you to stop almost dying on me!"
"Oh, come on." Tony rolled his eyes. "It's been years since I nearly died on you. Besides, this is Lowered Manhattan. I'd have stayed dead two, three hours max."
"We don't know that." Steve had to fight the urge to grab Tony by the shoulders and shake him. Past experience had conclusively proven that no amount of shaking, yelling, or rational explaining could instill a sense of self-preservation into Tony Stark. "We have no idea what the Correspondence could do. It's a sentient language with magical powers. For all we know, it could've killed you premanently."
"I don't think it actually wants me dead," Tony said thoughtfully. "Not until I return the box, anyhow. Insane, maybe, but not dead."
"If that's true," Steve said, "then why did it send you into the subway? The only reason you're not dead now was because a cat told me where to find you."
"It..." Tony hesitated. "The thing about the Correspondence is, it doesn't think like us. It doesn't understand about check points and police departments and things like that. All it knew was, the streets were full of humans, and it doesn't like humans."
"But it likes sorrow-spiders?"
"Mostly, yeah. Apparently, the spiders and the devils are... allied, I guess? In some sort of accord, anyhow. The Council would've returned the box to the Embassy once they were done with me, and as far as the Correspondence was concerned, that was good enough. It really didn't care what happened to me after."
"Was that supposed to be reassuring?" Steve asked. "Because it really isn't."
"Sorry." Tony patted his arm. "I didn't mean to get you all overwrought."
"I'm not overwrought."
"You're not?" Tony gave him a look of utter disbelief. "Because I'm pretty sure I recall you kneeling. By my bed. In a distinctly overwrought manner. I felt like little Nell on her deathbed."
"You were hallucinating," Steve said in his best deadpan voice. Tony just kept smirking at him, until he blushed and looked away. "Okay, fine, maybe I was a little... upset."
"Overwrought."
"Upset. It's a perfectly proportionate reaction when someone I care about tries to get eaten by giant spiders."
"I wasn't trying to get eaten."
"Could've fooled me."
"Fine, I'm sorry," Tony sighed. "Will it make you feel better if I promise never to do that again?"
"Making me feel better isn't the point," Steve said. "But I'm going to hold you to that promise."
Chapter 6
For the next ten days, the Avengers' existence narrowed to an ever-repeating cycle of money trickling in, and then trickling out again every time Black Widow visited. Sam arrived on the second day with an oversized duffel containing more unpolished glim than any of them had ever seen in one place. Peter dug an ancient Leicaflex from the back of his closet and begged Tony for some batteries so he could take a picture.
Luke went out four days in a row and came back looking more annoyed each time, before returning on the fifth day with a knapsack filled with moon pearls. He didn't say where he got them, and Steve didn't ask.
Natasha kept popping up at random intervals, staying just lost enough to stuff her pockets full of jewels and to deliver enigmatic snippets like "Mr. Mirrors has visited the Embassy and stayed for two days" or "three senior devils were seen leaving the House of Chimes after curfew." The fact that the devils and the Bazaar Masters were increasing their cooperation was discomfiting but not, in the general scheme of things, very informative. When Steve pointed this out, Natasha just growled "I'm working on it," and disappeared for three more days.
The devils' city-wide hunt for the box did not slack off as time passed. If anything, it became more intense. Posters advertising a five-thousand-echo reward for "return of stolen embassy property" were lost under new layers of wanted posters promising ever-increasing sums for information leading to the capture of Luke Cage, Captain America and Spider-Man. Peter brought a handful of them home after going out on a grocery run one morning.
"I'm framing mine," he said, holding up a poster with a rather dramatic sketch of Spider-Man swinging on a web line. "Just think, all those years with Jonah Jameson gunning after me, and I've never had a wanted poster before."
The LMPD went into a frenzy of activity for several days, arresting random people for everything from illegal tech possession to jaywalking. This sparked a rapidly spreading rumor that the Masters had authorized daily executions in the Bazaar until the devils got their box back. Maria Hill was seen going into the Brass Embassy alone, and not coming out until the next day. There were no executions, but the number of checkpoints doubled overnight.
Steve took to patrolling triple shifts every day, even if he had to do it out of uniform and without his shield. He was, perhaps, just a little bit rougher than he needed to be with any spirifers, dream-honey dealers and Unfinished Men he came across. It felt good to keep busy and to be accomplishing something, however small; but the nagging sense of his own uselessness never quite went away.
"Aren't you overdoing it a little?" Tony suggested. "I mean, honestly, when I'm the one telling you to slow down and take it easy, something's very wrong with the universe."
It was two in the morning, and they were in the workshop having dinner. Sort of. Steve was picking sullenly at the contents of his bowl, while Tony ignored his altogether. But they were in the same room, at the same time, with food, which had been enough for Tony to laugh and call it a date earlier. Normally, Steve shrugged of such teasing, but now he found himself oddly self-conscious and hesitant to meet Tony's eyes.
"Right," he said. "Something wrong with the universe. You mean aside from the fact that you, I, and the entire population of Manhattan are all stuck in a giant underground hole with no daylight, no fresh air, and no way out?"
Tony let out an amused snort. "Yeah, besides that."
"It's just... I hate spinning my wheels like this!" Steve burst out. "The entire city's in an uproar, innocent people are being rounded up like criminals, and I'm out chasing petty crooks while we raise bribe money for devils! What good am I doing here, exactly?"
"Could be worse," Tony said. "You could spend three years in a basement tinkering with tech that doesn't work."
Steve let his shoulders slump. "I'm wallowing, aren't I?"
Tony looked up from his work to give him a fond smile. "Just a little."
Steve stabbed at the contents of his dinner bowl with his fork, and tried not to sulk. Dinner was mushrooms -- again -- mixed with pieces of the pale, lumpy fish from the East River. Or what passed for the East River these days, anyhow. Steve supposed that sulking over his food was even more childish than sulking over lack of useful occupation, but there were times when he thought he might trade the shield for an apple or a glass of orange juice.
Across the table, Tony's dinner sat untouched while Tony kept working. He wore a pair of goggles with jeweler's loupes mounted on the lenses, and was poking at something tiny and intricate on a metal tray in front of him. The beetle-light was probably too dim for the work, but Tony was becoming increasingly obsessed with conserving his dwindling supply of fuel.
"What are you tinkering with now?" This was a risky question -- he might end up having to feign comprehension through a two-hour lecture on anything from nanotechnology to plasma physics -- but Steve figured he and Tony could both use the distraction.
"Fiber optic camera." Tony used a pair of tweezers to pick up a length of cable barely thicker than embroidery floss. He leaned forward until his face was a few inches above the table, and squinted behind the goggles as he attached the cable to the camera. "It's part of my new cunning plan to get our box open."
"Your what?" Steve's desultory mood abruptly turned to churning anxiety. "Tony--"
"Hey, hey, it's all right." Tony quickly sat up straight and lifted his arms, hands bent back to better show off the symbols on his wrists. "Still protected, see?" He tapped his forehead and his chest.
"Not if you go looking at the stuff again!" Steve tried to sound calm and rational, but suspected he wasn't doing the best job of it. "We don't know how strong your protection is, you can't risk--"
"I'm not going to look at it!" Tony looked genuinely horrified by the idea. "Honestly, trying to read the Correspondence was the wrong approach in the first place. I would've realized it ages ago, except for the whole mind-control thing. Because the point wasn't to read the box, but to open it. With this," he prodded the little coil of cable with one finger, "I can get the camera under the gears and inside the lock, take a look at the inner workings. Bypass the Correspondence altogether."
"I seem to recall that it melted your last camera," Steve said. Tony dismissed the objection with a careless wave of his hand.
"That was because I tried to photograph the actual symbols. I won't be doing that now. That's the one limitation the Correspondence has -- you have to look at it before it can affect you."
"I don't like it," Steve said.
Tony glared at him across the table. "Suggest an alternative, then."
And that was what it all came down to, wasn't it? They had no alternatives, or at least no good ones. They could admit defeat and return the box to the Embassy, or they could get the damned thing open and find out why it was so important. What they couldn't do was spin their wheels in uncertainty while the devils and the Masters tore the city apart looking for their property.
"You're right." Steve said, "if you can figure out the lock, then you should. But don't open it right away. Give Black Widow a chance to get more intel first. I'd like to know what we're dealing with before we set it free."
"Spoilsport," Tony muttered, and went back to work.
Most of the team were gathered in the parlor for a desultory poker game, when Peter suddenly set down his cards and said, "Uh-oh." This was never a good sign coming from Peter, so four more hands of cards hit the table as Steve, Luke, Jessica Jones and MJ all snapped to attention.
"What's going on?" Luke demanded.
"Not sure." Somehow, in the split second between his "uh-oh" and everyone else's reaction, Peter had moved from his chair to the ceiling. Now he squatted upside-down next to the chandelier and surveyed the room with nervous eyes. "Not an immediate threat, but definitely something--" He scurried across to the nearest window and looked out on Bleecker Street. "Oookay. There's about six devils gathered across the street, and they're looking very purposeful."
"What?" Jessica Jones nearly knocked the table over in her scramble to get to the window. "I thought this wasn't supposed to ever happen? Where's Wong?"
"I'll go find him," MJ said and hurried from the room.
Steve strode to the window and pulled the curtain back. There was, indeed, a group of devils sauntering up the block at a suspiciously slow pace and peering oh-so-casually into the first-floor windows of the brick townhouses across the street. The streetlights seemed to flicker and smoke a bit more than usual wherever they passed.
"Stylish bunch, aren't they?" Peter muttered. The devils were wearing zoot suits and fedoras. Steve supposed it was an advance from the Victorian-style frock coats and top hats they'd favored when they first arrived in the city. "I don't suppose they're just out looking for a jazz club?" MJ and Jessica both tilted their heads up to glare at him until he wilted a little and hunched his shoulders. "Okay, I guess not."
"I don't think they've made us," Steve said. "They wouldn't be combing the block like this if they knew which house they were looking for."
"Call me paranoid," Luke growled, "but devils across the street is already too close as far as I'm concerned.. And how are they on this block at all? I thought the wards were supposed to keep them away."
Steve had thought so too. In addition to the spells Strange himself had cast to disguise and protect the house, there were also the ones Wong had added after the Avengers had moved in. Supposedly -- Steve wasn't entirely sure he'd understood the details -- any devil that approached too closely would be seized with a sudden impulse to be somewhere else. The fact that they were this close now was cause for worry. For a moment, Steve wondered if Hill had decided to sell them out after all. But no, if she had revealed the exact location of the Sanctum Sanctorum, the devils would've arrived in greater numbers, likely with a swarm of bats and an army of Unfinished men backing them up. They didn't go in for subtlety.
"The wards are still working," Wong announced as he marched into the room. He was frowning, but his voice was reassuringly calm. "I would've felt it if they were damaged or removed."
"Then what are they doing here?" Jessica hissed. Her eyes were furious, but Steve could see the cold fear behind the anger. "My kid is asleep upstairs, Wong, if we get attacked here--"
"I don't think they're going to attack," Peter said. "Not in the next couple of seconds, anyhow." The twin scowls Luke and Jessica sent his way would've been comical under any other circumstances.
"We need to get them away from the house," Wong said. "I can reinforce all the protective spells and add some new ones, but it'll do no good if they're already inside the wards."
"No problem," Steve said. "Peter, suit up. You're with me."
"Aye-aye, Captain!" Peter gave him an appallingly sloppy salute, and did a somersault from the ceiling down to the floor.
Less than ten minutes later, he and Spider-Man were both on the roof, in costume, watching the devils try and fail to cross the street yet again.
"You know," Peter whispered, "this is actually kind of funny."
Steve had to admit that it was, a little. Even inside the wards, the devils were still clearly affected by the spells. The kept stepping into the street, then stumbling to a halt, glancing from side to side in obvious confusion, and returning to the sidewalk. Another brief session of window-peeping, and they would recover their wits and try again.
"This is all very well," Steve murmured, "but they're getting a little closer every time. We can't let them keep doing this." They needed to create a distraction, and they needed to create it from somewhere else. Steve gestured eastward and Spider-Man rose to his feet, silent for once.
This part of West Village was well-suited to rooftop travel, the streets not too wide and the buildings not too high. Steve and Peter made their way to the east end of the block, then swung diagonally across the intersection on one of Peter's web lines to land on top of an abandoned newsstand. Steve looked around, mentally mapping several fast departure routes, and positioned his shield for a throw.
"All right, let's get their attention."
"Ohh, let me!" Peter leaped ten feet from the newsstand roof to the nearest lamppost, perched there at a precarious angle, and shot a remarkably well-aimed web to snag a devil's hat right off his head. "How's that?"
Steve gave a thumbs-up as all six devils headed toward them at a run. "I'll go north, you go south. Make sure you've really lost them before you head home."
"Got it!" Peter let out an attention-grabbing Tarzan yell as he swung away, three of the devils stampeding after him at breakneck speed. Steve bounced his shield off the corner of the nearest building with enough noise to ensure that the other three would come after him.
Past experience had proven that devils were perfectly capable of scaling walls and leaping roofs when they had to, so Steve decided to stay off the streets for the time being. There were already a few pedestrians gawking from a safe distance, as well as at least three checkpoints within a five-block radius that Steve knew about. He had no intention of endangering civilians or drawing the LMPD into a full-scale manhunt. So he took off across the rooftops, making no effort at evasion or concealment until he was in sight of Washington Square Park.
The devils were fast and agile, but they didn't know the neighborhood the way Steve did. He led them in a wide circle around the park until he heard the unmistakable sound of an approaching bat swarm in the distance, then veered south onto Thompson Street, where he finally dropped to the sidewalk and ducked inside an abandoned parking garage.
The garage was a maze, five winding levels of brick and cement abandoned cars still rusting in their spaces. The walls were slick with mold and patches of luminescent fungus that provided the only light. The devils' cloven feet made an deafening clatter on the concrete floors, echoing off the walls and drowning out the softer sound of Steve's own footsteps. Steve found an elevator shaft, pried the door open just enough to squeeze through, and clung to the electrical cables on the back wall to wait as his pursuers thundered past on their to the lower levels. Once he was satisfied that they were all below him, he climbed the cables to the top, and made his way onto the rooftops again.
Twenty minutes later, having circled several blocks out of his way to make sure he was free of pursuit, Steve returned to the Sanctum Sanctorum to find Peter brushing dirt from his costume in the foyer, and Wong surrounded by a pile of books and notes in the library.
"Can you tell what happened?" Steve asked.
Wong put down the notebook he'd been scribbling in, and frowned at the page for a long time before replying.
"I believe," he said slowly, "that I've discovered a gap in the wards. Not all of them, mind you. The shields against ordinary physical invasion are working just fine. It's the spells originally cast by Dr. Strange to ward against magical intrusions that are the problem. They were designed to protect the Sanctum Sanctorum itself, its contents, or any of the people living here -- Dr. Strange and myself, to begin with. When you and your team moved in, I expanded the spells' protection to include each of you. But I did not think to expand it to include specific items in our possession."
"Specific items." Steve winced as the implication sank in. "Like the box."
"Among other things." Wong's frown grew more pronounced. "The box is almost certainly what the devils have focused on, if they attempted a location spell. But in fact, any unique item known to be owned by one of us would do."
Steve's shield. The Iron Man armor. Any costume or weapon ever used in public by any of them. Just thinking about how vulnerable they'd been all this time made Steve feel a little sick. Now that the devils had almost found them once, how long would it be before they returned?
"Could you expand the wards again?" he asked. "We could each give you a list, so that you know which items need concealing."
"I can try." Wong didn't sound very happy at the prospect. "It will take time, however. And there is always an element of risk in having me modify one of Dr. Strange's spells. He was the Sorcerer Supreme, and I'm... not."
"Maybe not," Steve said. "But you're the one who has sheltered us and kept us safe for the past three years. I think we can consider your abilities well-proven."
"I appreciate the confidence," Wong said wryly. "But perhaps we'd each better pack an emergency bag, just in case."
Luke and Jessica moved out. Natasha offered them one of her many bolt-holes and they took her up on the offer, leaving all their identifiable possessions behind. Steve was sorry to see them go, but he couldn't blame them, either. The Sanctum Sanctorum could no longer be considered secure, not even after Wong expanded the wards, and Luke and Jessica had a kid to think about.
The remaining Avengers set up a watch schedule, two people on the roof at all times. Even MJ took her turn, glaring Peter into submission when he looked as if he might be vaguely considering an objection.
"I don't need superpowers to raise an alarm," she'd growled, and Peter had raised his hands in surrender and quickly changed the subject.
Just about every watch saw at least a few devils lurking at the far ends of the block, but none ever came near the house again.
Natasha disappeared for two days, and came back looking unwashed and sleep-deprived and carrying a messenger bag half-filled with warmly glowing chunks of amber. She tossed the last of their glim stash into the bag on top of the amber, and surveyed the resulting pile with a critical eye.
"I guess it'll have to do," she said. "My contact at the Archive says she's ready to come across with the information. Though I'll have a hell of a fun time getting all this shit around the checkpoints and to my rendezvous spot."
"Do you need backup?" Steve asked.
Natasha shook her head. "Amaryllis will run if she thinks I'm not alone. I'll deal."
"Your devil informant is named Amaryllis?" Peter looked affronted. "Whatever happened to nice respectable names like Beelzebub or Mephisto? Hell has no style anymore."
"Be careful," Steve told her. "The LMPD's getting jumpier every day. I'd rather not break you out of a jail cell if I don't have to."
"Who are you kidding?" Natasha smirked. "You're just itching for a nice exciting jail break."
Apparently, his restlessness was more obvious than he'd thought. "Okay," Steve admitted, "maybe a little. But that's still no reason for you to provide me with one."
Natasha's smile reminded him disturbingly of Tony when he was up to no good. "I'll do my best to keep you frustrated."
With no jailbreak to keep him occupied and all other tasks finished for the day, Steve retreated to his room and tried to read, but the Dick Francis mystery he'd borrowed from Jessica Drew failed to hold his attention for more than a minute at a time. He was just considering going downstairs to look for something else, when someone knocked on his door. A moment later, Tony came in without waiting for an answer.
"Hey, Picasso." Tony held up a glass jar. "I need you to do a touch-up for me." The jar held about a cup of dark liquid and thin brush.
Steve set aside his book and sat up. "Is something wrong?"
"Nah, just normal wear and tear." Tony brushed the hair back from his forehead to show where the glyph Steve had painted ten days before was starting to chip and fade. "I've been careful, keeping the ink covered when I wash and everything, but I don't think it's meant to be permanent. And..." he winced and rubbed one eye with the heel of his hand. "I think I'm hearing it again. I'm hearing something, anyhow."
"Again?" Steve scrambled to his feet. "How bad is it? You should've said something sooner."
"Relax." Tony held up the jar again. "It only started a couple of hours ago, and at first I wasn't sure if I was really hearing anything. Once I was sure, I went straight to Wong and then to you. So let's do this, and then we can both stop worrying about the voices in my head, okay?"
"Of course." Steve glanced around the room. "Uhm... over there would probably work best."
Just as the Sanctum Santorum had accommodated Tony by adding a sleeping area to his workshop, it had accommodated Steve by creating a work area in his bedroom. Three days after the Avengers had first moved in, the room had acquired a small alcove with a sturdy oak drawing desk and stool, just the right height for Steve to comfortably sit and sketch. The light was bad, but no worse than anywhere else, and a drawer in the desk provided an apparently infinite supply of paper and pencils. Even on days when Steve didn't sit down to draw, just knowing that the place and the materials were there was a comfort.
"All right, then." Tony put the jar down on the desk, planted himself on the stool facing Steve, pulled his t-shirt off and dropped it to the floor. "Do your stuff."
Steve set new candles in the two mirror-backed sconces on either side of the alcove, and lit them with the smaller candle from his nightstand.
"Okay, give me your hand."
The last time they'd done this, Tony had been catatonic, possibly dying, and Steve had been too worried to focus on anything except the immediate task. This time around, it became impossible to ignore how intimate the whole process was. How close Tony was, how comfortably his hand rested in Steve's cupped palm. How much the stroke of brush against skin felt like a caress. Steve tried to focus on the intricacy of the design, on keeping the lines straight and the ink smooth and even. Tried to pretend that he wasn't acutely aware of Tony's knee pressed against his thigh. He kept his hands steady and avoided looking at Tony's face as he worked, but he didn't need to look to know that Tony was being unusually still and silent.
Things only got more awkward once he finished retouching the symbols on Tony's wrists and had to move closer to work on the chest design. Tony spread his knees apart to give Steve room to stand, and leaned back, bracing his hands on the desk behind him. The position certainly offered a good angle for painting, but it also made Tony's back arch and stretched his jeans tight across his groin. Steve's mouth went dry. There was no way Tony was doing that without knowing exactly what he looked like, or without noticing Steve's reaction.
He stirred the ink with the brush, and painted a line. Tony curled his hands around the edge of the desk.
"Maybe I should get these tattooed on," he drawled. His voice was light but not entirely steady. "It would make showering easier, at least."
Steve made a valiant but only partly-successful attempt to keep from imagining Tony in the shower. "According to Wong, these symbols are from one of Hell's alphabets. You probably don't want them on you permanently."
"Good point." Tony let out a short, nervous laugh and lapsed into silence again.
Three symbols down. One to go. Steve leaned forward and brushed Tony's hair back from his forehead with his left hand.
"Tilt your head back. A little more. Good, now hold still."
"Sure." Tony closed his eyes. "No problem."
"I'm almost done." Steve placed the final brush strokes, dropped the brush into the jar, and rested his right hand on Tony's shoulder. "There. That should do it."
"Already?" Tony opened his eyes and blinked slowly, as if dazed. "That was fast."
"Did it help?" Steve asked.
"I think so..." Tony stared into the distance for a few seconds. "Yeah. I can't hear it at all now. Thanks."
"You're welcome." That was Steve's cue to step back. Or at least to pull away. Not to stand there, one hand one Tony's shoulder and the other in his hair, and stare like a dumbstruck idiot at Tony's mouth. This was no good. He was making an awkward moment even worse, and the longer he hesitated the more it would--
"Oh, for fuck's sake," Tony said, "just kiss me already." And then, while Steve was still trying to process the words, he did the job himself, tugging at Steve's collar to pull him closer and pressing their mouths together.
For a moment, Steve simply froze, then instinct and tactical training kicked in. Situation: Tony was kissing him. Appropriate response: kiss back. Steve's hands were already in more or less the right places; it was no effort at all to pull Tony closer, to lick into Tony's mouth and make him groan, to shift his weight forward until the stool Tony was sitting on tilted back to bump the desk. Something fell to the floor with a muted clatter. Steve suspected it was the ink jar, spilling its contents on the carpet. He didn't care. Not when Tony was right there, still clutching at Steve's collar and breathing soft, needy noises into Steve's mouth.
"Yeah," Tony gasped when Steve finally pulled back, "okay. That went well." He sounded vaguely surprised by this turn of events, as if he hadn't been the one who started it.
"You were expecting it not to?" Steve asked.
"I..." Tony hesitated. "Honestly, I wasn't sure. You seemed like you wouldn't mind, and I'm generally pretty good at telling if someone would mind being kissed, but I had a lot of wishful thinking working against me here."
"Wishful thinking. Right." Steve struggled to collect his thoughts. It was difficult, when Tony was still so close and stroking his thumb along Steve's collarbone in a very distracting manner. "Just how much have you been wishfully thinking about this?"
"A lot," Tony admitted. Steve frowned, feeling suddenly suspicious.
"Wait. You didn't invent this whole touch-up business just to get me to kiss you, did you?"
"No!" Tony's momentary look of outrage quickly shifted to a smirk. "Though I totally would've if I'd thought of it."
Steve decided he could live with that.
Chapter 7
"You're staring at me," Tony declared.
Steve considered denying it, then decided not to bother. After all, it wasn't as if he was being subtle about it.
"What can I say?" He shrugged. "You look good."
It was true, and not just in the obvious sense. Tony was a good-looking man, that was hardly news. But more to the point, he was smiling as he worked. His eyes were bright with enjoyment, and he moved with more energy that Steve recalled seeing in him since-- well, he wasn't sure how long. Steve wondered how much of this rare good mood came from Tony finally having something constructive to do, and how much was due to the fact that the two of them had spent a significant fraction of the past twenty-four hours necking like horny teenagers. The latter was certainly doing a lot for Steve's own mood.
There was a small bruise on Tony's neck, barely visible above the collar of his t-shirt. Steve could remember exactly when and how he put it there. Just seeing it made him want to reach across the table and pull Tony close again, wires and circuit boards be damned. Apparently, making out with Tony Stark was addictive, once you got started.
"Wait, I take it back." Tony set aside the fiber optic camera he'd just finished connecting to his laptop, and stood up straight. "You're not staring, you're ogling. Captain America is ogling me. I'm deeply shocked."
"No, you're not," Steve said. "And I'm not ogling, I'm... appreciating."
"Appreciating. Right." Tony smirked. "Well, you can keep appreciating from a distance for now, because I finally got this working." He snapped the laptop shut, coiled the camera cable on top of it, and picked up the whole bundle. "Let's go try it out."
The box was in a cabinet at the back of the room, locked inside a sturdy portable safe Wong had provided after they'd brought Tony home from the subway. Steve opened the cabinet and hesitated, hand hovering over the safe's combination lock.
"Are you sure it's--"
"It's fine!" Tony said irritably. "I'm protected, you're right here, and as I've told you about a million times, I'm not going to look at it. Here." He marched over to the shower stall and snatched a towel off the rack. "Cover it up before I come near it, if it makes you feel better."
"It does, actually." Steve felt faintly foolish, swaddling the box in layers of fluffy terrycloth, but a little foolishness seemed like a small price to pay for Tony's safety. "And you really can't blame me for being cautious, given how much trouble we've had already."
"I'm not blaming you," Tony said. "I'm the one who's been possessed by that thing, and trust me, I'm not looking to relive the experience. But we still need to do this, so let's get it over with, all right?"
"All right." Steve placed the towel-wrapped box on the table in front of Tony. "Just be careful, will you?"
"Aren't I always?" Tony drawled, then quickly held up one hand. "Don't answer that."
He lifted the camera with a pair of tweezers, and slid his hands under the towel.
"Okay, let's see if I can get this in place... fuck, it's like trying to thread a needle without looking... nope, not there... and not there either... got it!" He moved the box aside and bent over the laptop, typing in rapid-fire bursts. "Look, it's working." He turned the laptop around so that Steve could see the screen, which looked rather like a kaleidoscope rendered in shades of gray -- dozens of geometric shapes rearranging themselves in rapidly shifting patterns.
"I'll take your word for it," Steve said.
"It's perfectly straightforward, really." Tony made an unnecessary and entirely unsuccessful attempt to look modest. "Under all the magical bells and whistles, it's just a regular lock. A little more complicated than most, sure, but still just a bunch of tumblers that need to be lined up. I've got the camera mapping it from the inside and feeding the images into the laptop. Once it's done, I've got a program that'll crunch through the combinations until it finds the right one. It'll take a few hours, maybe a day, but we'll get the thing open."
"Uhm, hello?" Peter's voice drifted down from the top of the basement stairs, sounding a great deal more tentative than usual. "This is your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, giving you advance notice that I'm coming down. So that you can, uhm, get decent and everything. I'm just saying. Coming down reeeeeeally sloooooowly, okay?"
"It's fine, Peter." Steve suppressed a grin. "I think we may have traumatized him a bit earlier," he murmured to Tony.
"It's his own fault." Tony looked smug. "He should've knocked before barging in."
"I don't think most people knock before entering a kitchen," Steve pointed out.
"Hey there." Peter cracked the door open and poked his head in. "Sorry to interrupt whatever it is I'm interrupting, but Natasha's back, and she says she has info we all need to hear."
"All right, correct me if I'm wrong." Natasha coiled in one of the plush armchairs in the first-floor drawing room like a large cat waiting to pounce. "I'm neither a magician nor a lawyer, so maybe I've heard wrong, but don't most supernatural contracts have an escape clause? Some condition that will invalidate the whole thing?"
"Not always," Wong said judiciously. "But in the majority of cases, yes. Of course, the condition is often hidden, or phrased in a misleading manner. But it appears to be built into the nature of both gods and devils to make their bargains reversible. I suppose creatures that live for millennia must be wary of making unbreakable commitments. Why do you ask?" His expression abruptly turned dark. "You haven't made a bargain yourself, have you?"
"Hell, no." Natasha looked disgusted. "I may be reckless from time to time, but I've never been that crazy. But we all know someone who is."
"Okay, I'll bite," Tony said. "Who is it?"
"Dr. Doom." Natasha's lips curled into a predatory grin. "According to Amaryllis, our mystery box contains his infernal contract. The one he sold Manhattan with."
"He sold it?" Wong leaned forward, eyes wide. "Are you certain?"
Natasha shrugged. "As certain as I can be, given that I got the intel from a devil."
"I've wondered about that." Wong sprang to his feet and paced back and forth in front of the fireplace. In three years of living in the man's house, Steve had never seen him so visibly excited. "All this time, I've tried to find out what Doom had done, what spell he might've used. I considered the possibility of a sale, but everything I've learned about the Masters of the Bazaar indicated that they will only buy from the rightful owner. Doom was never the rightful owner of Manhattan, so how could he have done it?"
"More to the point," Peter said from the other side of the room, "can we undo it?"
"I bet we can." MJ had been sitting on the couch with her legs tucked up and her head pillowed on Peter's shoulder, but now she planted her feet on the floor and sat straight, as tense and excited as everyone else in the room. "Otherwise, why all the fuss? The Masters and the devils have all been collectively shitting bricks ever since we got that box. If the contract was unbreakable -- if there isn't something we can do about it -- why would they care?"
"Not to mention," Tony added, "why put a brain-eating lock on it?"
"We must get that box open," Wong had stopped pacing, but didn't relax. Now he was staring intently into the fireplace and drumming his fingers against the mantelpiece. "We need to know what's in that contract."
"I'm working on it," Tony said.
"In the meantime," Natasha said, "here's one more thing to think about: I've been keeping an eye on the Brass Embassy as much as I could over the past few days, and they're beefing up security in a hurry. Doubled guard at every entrance, new wards, new bars on the windows, passwords changing every six hours. And yesterday, they had a shipment of mirrors delivered -- large ones, all six feet high or more. I counted at least ten, and they were still bringing them in when I left."
"Mirrors?" Steve frowned. "What do devils need that many mirrors for?"
"Search me." Natasha shrugged. "If I looked like them, I'd be sending all the mirrors out of the house."
"There must be a connection." Steve did his best to sound calm, but his heart was pounding. Could it really happen, just like that? After three years of futility, could they finally accomplish something real, something that would actually bring the city back into the sunlight, instead of just fighting to make the darkness a little more tolerable? "The Embassy hasn't changed its routine in years. Now they're increasing security just as we get our hands on a possible way to undo what Doom has done? If that's a coincidence, I'll eat my shield."
"Great!" Peter said. "We get to storm the embassy to Hell. I'm sure that won't be a problem at all."
"Can it even be stormed?" Jessica Drew asked. "From what I've heard, the place is warded to hell and back. Literally."
"I may be the able to do something about the wards," Wong said. "Weaken them, at least. But it will take time, and the release of magical energy will attract attention. I can't just march up to the front door and start casting spells."
"I have some ideas about that," Steve said, "but let's not jump the gun. We don't know yet if we'll need to storm anything, and we won't know until Tony gets that box open."
"But no pressure," Tony muttered.
"You know," Peter said, "if this thing does turn out to be the box that saved Manhattan, I'd just like us all to remember who it was that snatched it. I'm just saying." He rocked his chair back, looking highly pleased with himself. "Let's see the Daily Bugle put a negative spin on that one."
"Do you think it'll work?" Tony's voice was muted and sleepy, his breath warm against Steve's bare skin. They were in Steve's bed, tangled together on top of the rumpled covers, their clothes in a heap on the floor. Tony had one arm draped across Steve's chest, and his head tucked into the crook of Steve's shoulder. "Can we really put Manhattan back where it belongs?"
"Yes," Steve said.
There was a brief, expectant silence, and then Tony planted his left elbow on the pillow next to Steve's head and propped himself up.
"That's it? That's all you have to say? Where's my inspiring Captain America pep talk? I feel cheated."
"You asked a yes or no question." Steve wrapped one arm around Tony's waist and pulled him back down. "I answered it. If you need more... well, you heard Wong. Contracts can be broken."
"I know," Tony said. "I used to keep three international law firms on retainer, just to deal with that sort of thing. I'm just saying, if that's what it comes down to... Hell might have the better lawyers."
"Doesn't matter," Steve said firmly. "The devils are thieves and cowards, and the stakes aren't the same for them as they are for us. They can afford to lose. We can't. That means they'll back down if the cost of winning becomes too high. We won't."
"I hope you're right," Tony sighed. "About them backing down, I mean -- I already know we won't." He trailed his hand down Steve's arm, and curled his fingers comfortably into Steve's cupped palm. "I never thought I'd have to harrow Hell just so I can have internet access again. It'll be worth it, though?"
"Is that what you miss the most?" Steve asked, amused and appalled at the same time. "The internet?"
"What I miss," Tony grumbled, "is a world where the laws of nature work properly. A world where cats don't talk, and clay people don't walk around, and giant spiders can't exist because the square-cube law matters, dammit. Also, a world with coffee makers. And lots of coffee to put in them." He lifted his head from Steve's shoulder and fixed Steve with a curious look. "So what do you miss?"
"Weather," Steve said promptly. "Sun and clouds and rain and snow. Even that godawful half-frozen slush we seem to get in the city every winter. Just... anything but stale air and darkness." He gazed up at the candle-lit ceiling, tried to imagine an open sky instead. It was disturbing, how much difficulty he had remembering the colors. "I am half-sick of shadows," he muttered.
The sympathy in Tony's eyes took the sting off his laughter. "Okay, Lady of Shalott." He wriggled closer and planted a kiss on the corner of Steve's mouth. "Tell you what, if we get back to Earth--"
"When we get back."
"Okay, when. When we get back, you just tell me what weather you want, and we'll find a place that has it and go there. And then we'll sit out in the weather and drink coffee."
"It's a date." Steve buried his fingers in Tony's hair and pulled him in for a longer, deeper kiss.
If Doom hadn't brought about the Descent, he and Tony might never have done this. It was probably selfish of him to consider that, weighed against everything else. Just at that moment, though, with Tony's mouth pressed against his, Steve found it difficult to care.
"That's it?" Steve picked up one of the three folded sheets Tony had removed from the newly-opened box. The sheet appeared to be heavy-stock cotton paper, cream-colored and gilded at the corners. The neat, tiny writing that covered both sides was in no language Steve could recognize, but it wasn't the Correspondence, either. "I was expecting something a little more impressive."
"Personally, I'm very impressed." Tony picked up one the other two sheets. "The last contract I signed was over a hundred pages long. Apparently, Hell has mastered the art of the concise legal document. Come on, let's see what Wong can make of this."
"Well. This is interesting." Wong laid out the contract pages in order across his desk in the library and squinted at the small writing in the dim light. "You have to give Doom credit for inventiveness."
"Can you actually read that?" Steve leaned in from the other side of the desk to peer at the pages. "It doesn't even look like a language to me."
"The second alphabet of Hell is the alphabet of deeds and contracts," Wang said in a distracted tone as he flipped the first page over. "It's also the one most commonly distributed outside of Hell, and most comprehensively documented. I can read it as well as I read any of the human languages I've studied. However--" He gave Steve a pointed frown. "--I cannot speed read it. Allow me a few minutes, please."
"Of course." Steve stepped away from the desk and wandered to a nearby bookcase, where Tony was leafing through what appeared to be an illustrated encyclopedia of sea monsters. "I'll just... wait over here."
"See?" Tony murmured with quiet amusement. "I'm not the only one who thinks you hover."
Steve decided not to dignify that with an answer.
"I was right," Wong said after several minutes of expectant silence during which Steve absolutely, definitely did not hover. "Doom had no authority to sell Manhattan to the Masters. What this contract describes is a workaround, a three-way deal between Doom, Hell, and the Bazaar. It was the devils who gave Doom the power to transport Manhattan to this dimension. Once that was accomplished, he and the Masters performed what appears to be a formal exchange of gifts."
"Exchange of gifts." Tony rolled his eyes. "Right. Sounds like a tax dodge to me. Or a way to get around trade regulations."
"Something like that, yes." Wong smiled thinly. "The Masters cannot purchase a city from a man who has no right to sell it. But they're under no obligation to investigate the provenance of any gifts they receive. So Doom gave them Manhattan, and in return the Masters gave him..." He picked up the last sheet and frowned at it.
"Gave him what?" Steve prompted.
"According to this, 'the power to bend all earthly creatures to his will.' Some form of mass mind control, I presume."
"Yeah," Tony said in a tight voice. "That sounds like the sort of thing Doom would do."
Steve felt sick. He'd guessed it before, of course. Doom would never have attempted a bargain this big and this risky without a proportionate payoff. But to hear it spoken out loud, to know beyond doubt or denial that Doom had been ruling Earth for three years while Steve and the other Avengers were trapped and out of reach--
"How do we undo this?" he demanded, at the same time as Tony said, "What does Hell get out of it?"
"As it happens," Wong said, "both your questions have the same answer." He tapped his finger against the last page. "Without a proper Bazaar sale, Manhattan's presence in this dimension is unnatural. It takes power to keep it here, and that power must be maintained. By the terms of the contract, there is a ritual that must be performed every year on the anniversary of the original bargain. Doom must tithe a thousand human souls to Hell, and in return, the devils renew the spell that keeps us here."
A thousand souls a year. Steve suppressed a shudder and forced himself to focus. He couldn't afford to lose his composure now, not when they were so close to an answer.
"So if the ritual doesn't happen--"
"Manhattan returns to its proper place." Wong's voice shook with barely suppressed excitement. "It would void both Doom's contract with Hell and his arrangement with the Masters."
"How much do you want to bet that this is what the Embassy has been preparing for?" Tony sounded as shaken as Steve felt, but his eyes were cold and determined. "We'll have to get in there. Does anyone know when the anniversary of the Descent is, exactly? It should be sometime soon."
"Two days from now," Steve said. Both Tony and Wong turned to stare at him. "What?"
"We haven't had a day or a night in three years," Tony said slowly. "Half the clocks in the city don't work and the other half don't agree with each other. And you can rattle off the date just like that?"
Steve shrugged, feeling suddenly self-conscious. "I have a good internal clock. Can we stick to the point, please?"
"The point. Right." Tony shut the book he was holding and leaned back against the bookcase behind him. "The point being, we have two days to figure out how to get into the Brass Embassy just as they've doubled their security. That should be fun."
"Actually," Steve said, "Getting in is the easy part."
It felt good to wear his uniform in public again. To feel the familiar weight of the mail shirt across his shoulders, the comforting heft of the shield on his arm, and not to have to hide it. Steve had kept to the rooftops for most of the trip, but now he dropped to the street, let himself be clearly seen as he crossed Park Row to the entrance of One Police Plaza.
His entrance caused something of a stir. The guard at the front desk leaped to his feet, and the officers milling in the lobby all spun to face him. A few of the officers drew their guns, but they looked uncertain as they did it. Steve stopped, lowered the shield to the floor to rest against his leg, and slowly raised his hands above his head.
"I want to talk to Maria Hill," he called out.
Chapter 8
Despite its name, Hell's embassy to Lowered Manhattan was built not from brass but from massive blocks of mottled gray stone, with an imposing marble portico across the front facade. It squatted in the center of what used to be Sheep Meadow, surrounded by mossy blue lawns and carefully tended patches of luminous fungus, and warded with at least as much protective magic as the Sanctum Sanctorum. Over the years, every superhero in the city and a few of the supervillains had had a go at the place, and no one had managed to so much as crack a window pane.
Some people claimed the name was a reference to the metallic yellow sheen of the devils' eyes. Some cited rumors of a ballroom with a heated brass floor where humans who'd sold their souls were forced to dance barefoot for Hell's amusement. As Steve climbed the steps to the front door, he wondered if the name had anything to do with the vast array of locks that guarded the building's doors and windows.
"Keep your eyes down," Maria Hill hissed from just behind his right shoulder. "This'll have a better chance of working if you at least try to look defeated."
Steve slumped his shoulders and kept his gaze fixed on the polished marble beneath his boots. Didn't look up, not even when the bottom edge of an iron door came into view, with a pair of cloven feet on either side. The feet -- or hooves, Steve supposed -- poked out from the cuffs of crisp black trousers with gold braid down the seams. The devils had a thing for elaborate uniforms.
He felt horribly exposed, standing in front of the guards with his wrists shackled and his shield out of reach. The presence of three uniformed LMPD officers behind him didn't exactly help. Hill had sworn that her people were trustworthy, but to Steve they were another unknown quantity in a plan that already had more unknowns than he liked. He would've left them out all together, but Hill had insisted that it would look suspicious if she showed up escorting an important prisoner alone, and Steve had to go with her judgment on that one. She'd spent a lot more time dealing with devils than he had.
"Detective Hill," the guard on the left greeted. His speech was a little slurred, like all devils'. Fangs and forked tongues were poorly suited to human sounds. "We weren't expecting you tonight."
"Hello, Marlowe. Wormwood." Hill's voice held the ease of long familiarity. She nodded at each guard in turn, then rattled off a long string of guttural syllables that were presumably the password. "I've got a present for your bosses."
One of the other officers planted a hand in the middle of Steve's back and shoved. Steve let himself stumble forward a little, then decided it would be in character to finally stand up straight. He squared his shoulders and glared at the guards, who stared back with impassive yellow eyes.
"That's one of your superheroes, isn't it?" Marlowe hissed. "One of the ones the Masters posted the reward for."
"That's right. He had this with him when we caught him." Hill took a step forward and held up the box, balanced on a circular tray draped in a velvet cloth the color of dried blood. "Still don't know what the fuss is about this thing, but I figured I'd better deliver it in person."
Wormwood let out a thoughtful hiss and darted his tongue out one corner of his mouth. "Maybe we'd better bring him in while you wait outside. Security, you know?"
"What, thinking of claiming the reward for yourselves?" Hill's sneer was pure acid. Steve could sort of admire it when it wasn't directed at himself. "I hope you have a convincing explanation for how you managed to capture a fugitive while standing guard duty. Or are you going to tell them you abandoned you post and try to explain that instead?"
The guards' eyes narrowed to angry slits. They hissed some more, but seemed to have no better response to offer.
"Tell you what," Hill said, "you let me go in there and claim my money, and I'm sure I'll be in a very good mood when I come back. And when I'm in a good mood, I like to share. Spread the wealth around." She smiled thinly. "Make sure my friends are as happy as I am. You two are my friends, right?"
Wormwood and Marlowe squinted at each other, then at Hill, then at Steve. Wormwood flicked his tongue again, and stepped forward.
"We need to make sure he's secure," he said.
Steve stood very still while the two devils patted him down and tested his shackles. Their hands were hot enough that he could feel them through leather and mail. Marlowe pulled Steve's cowl back to examine his face, stepped back with an annoyed shrug, and turned toward the door.
It took him nearly two minutes to undo the array of locks and deadbolts that barred the door. When the final bolt clicked aside, he shoved the door open and gave Hill a jagged, mocking grin.
"Go on then, bring him in."
"Thanks," Hill said, and shot him in the face.
Marlowe dropped to the ground, looking more startled than hurt. Wormwood spat out what was presumably a curse, and pounced for Hill's gun arm. Steve intercepted him with a tackle, which felt a lot like tackling the Rhino but did at least take him down for a couple of seconds. Steve rolled free just in time for one of Hill's men to toss him the key to the shackles. Hill herself planted herself just inside the open door, and let the box and the velvet cloth drop to the ground to reveal Steve's shield.
Inside, an alarm bell clanged. Marlowe and Wormwood leaped to their feet and attacked Hill again, only to be shot down once more by the LMPD officers. Marlowe did land one pile driver of a blow that would've probably cracked Hill's skull if she hadn't raised the shield in time. The impact drove her to her knees but didn't budge her from the door.
"We'll have every devil in the embassy here in a moment!" she yelled. "Your people better get here soon!"
"They're coming," Steve yelled back. "Give me my shield!" Hill tossed it to him, and he caught it and slipped his arm through the straps.
The clatter of cloven feet on stone tiles signaled the imminent arrival of reinforcements from inside the embassy. At the same time, Steve's own reinforcements swooped down from above, where they'd been circling out of sight in the darkness beneath the cavern roof. Spider-Woman and Jewel carried Black Widow and Wong, while Spider-Man clung to Iron Man's armor, with the Falcon following close behind. Only Luke was missing -- he was back at the Sanctum Sanctorum with Danni, having lost a vicious argument and two out of three coin tosses with his wife.
The prospect of fighting with his shield again felt great, but the sight of Tony in the armor was even better. Though maybe it wasn't the armor itself, but the memory of the bright anticipation on Tony's face as he put it on. Tony had poured every last drop of his gasoline stash into the generator in order to get the repulsors and power cells charged for this one last battle.
"If we pull this off," he'd told Steve with a grin, "then we'll be back on Earth and I'll have all the electricity I want. And if we fail -- well, then it'll hardly matter, will it?"
Now he landed on the terrace with enough force to make the marble shudder beneath his boots, and blasted Marlowe and Wormwood with a burst of repulsor fire before they had a chance to get up again. Spider-Man provided the finishing touch by webbing both devils to the floor.
"Good timing," Steve said. "Let's all get inside now. Hill, you have point."
According to Natasha's intelligence, the ritual was to take place in the domed chamber at the center of the embassy building. According to Wong, it was likely to happen at the same time of night as Doom's original spell three years ago. According to Hill, she knew the building layout well enough to get them where they needed to go. That was a few too many accordings for Steve's liking, but they'd had no time to lay elaborate plans. Steve followed Hill through the door, and didn't bother to suppress his smile as Iron Man fell into step beside him.
The front door opened into a short, narrow corridor that led to a high-ceilinged antechamber containing some ornate but otherwise unremarkable chairs and benches. A row of chandeliers held thick, smoky candles that gave off a strange greenish light. The walls were hung with tapestries of elaborately robed devils and mythological beasts. The embroidered figures seemed to move in Steve's peripheral vision, but held still when he looked at them directly. There were six sturdy-looking doors leading out of the room, but no windows.
"I don't mean to complain," Spider-Man said as they all filed into the room, "but shouldn't somebody be attacking us by now?"
As if in response to his words, all the candles went out. There was about half a second of complete darkness before the high beam on Iron Man's helmet switched on. And in the space of that half a second, the room somehow filled with several dozen very angry-looking devils.
"You just had to ask, didn't you?" Jewel muttered, and floated up to the ceiling.
"Make for the northwest door!" Hill yelled, just as the first line of devils pounced.
With that many bodies in the fight, there was no space for finesse. Steve's tactics narrowed to "if it's not an Avenger or a cop, hit it." Devils were preternaturally strong and fast, and their touch scorched like hot iron, but at the end of the day, fighting them wasn't that different from fighting Unfinished Men. Steve slammed his shield into yellow-eyed faces, dodged blows from sharp-clawed hands, and did his best to keep himself pointed into a more or less northwest direction.
He tried to keep an eye out on the others as he moved. Jewel, Spider-Woman and Falcon attacked from above, darting in and out of the thickest parts of the fight. Spider-Man leaped from wall to wall, shooting webs as he went. Black Widow fought side by side with Hill and her team, matching Hill's moves with an ease that spoke of shared SHIELD training. Wong kept close to the walls, making complex hand gestures and chanting words Steve was too far away to hear. With any luck, this meant the building's internal wards would be weakened when the Avengers tried to advance further inside.
Iron Man, predictably, was in the thickest part of the fight. The devils seemed frightened and enraged by him at the same time. They would surround him in groups, hissing and spitting, then attack all at once. The armor was already scorched and dented in several places, but Tony was steady on his feet and firing repulsor and plasma blasts at a steady pace.
"Iron Man!" Steve slammed an elbow into a charging devil's chin, dropped and rolled to avoid a clawed swipe from behind, and came up on his feet at Tony's side. "We need to get everyone together and through that door over there."
"Gotcha." Tony fired a flare toward the ceiling. "Avengers, to me!"
Something looped around Steve's ankles and yanked. He twisted as he fell, rolled, and brought his shield edge down onto what turned out to be a two-headed green snake with a body as thick as Steve's thigh. The thing looked familiar, and it took Steve a moment to figure out where he'd seen it before.
"They're coming out of the tapestries!" He yelled. Not the most coherent statement he'd ever made, but he suspected the others would know what he meant.
"No kidding?" Spider-Man swung down from the chandelier to web the snake's heads to the floor. "I was wondering where the giant flying dog came from."
Another flare burst, followed by a small but remarkably loud explosion that turned the northwest door into splinters. Either Wong's counterspells were working, or the high-tech energy of the repulsors was too much for the wards. "Everyone this way!" Tony shouted. The armor magnified his voice to drown out the noise of the fight. He launched into the air, dipped, and came up again with an LMPD officer dangling from each arm. He tossed them through the blasted doorway like rag dolls, then dove in again to get Hill, just as Falcon and Jewel flew down for the rest of the Avengers. Steve battered his way through on his own, sprinting though the doorway just as Spider-Man swung in above him.
They were in another corridor now, which gave them a slight tactical advantage. The devils seemed reluctant to follow them into a confined space where they could only attack two or three at a time. They hung back in the antechamber, and let the creatures from the tapestries give pursuit. A snake-tailed panther nearly took a healthy bite from Steve's leg, and something that looked like a cross between a greyhound and a vulture managed one swipe of its beak across his left shoulder before a plasma burst sent it reeling back.
"You all right?" Tony's voice sounded slightly winded behind the faceplate. He was limping, one metal boot melted out of shape and smoking at the seams.
"Fine." Steve flexed his arm to make sure. The mailed sleeve of his uniform was torn right through and singed at the edges, but there was no blood. The creature's beak had been as hot as the devils' claws, hot enough to cauterize the wound it made. Steve suspected it would hurt like hell once the battle rush wore off, but right now all he felt was a dull throb. "You're the one who's limping."
"It's nothing." Tony braced his hand against the wall and took another clanking step. "They fried the circuits but didn't get past the insulation. Hey, Hill, are we almost there yet?"
"Shut up and keep moving," Hill snapped back.
The route they followed turned, branched, turned again and again. Dozens of corridors crossed each other at oblique angles. It seemed to Steve that they were covering more ground than the building could actually contain. But Hill never slowed or hesitated as she took each corner. Steve just hoped her confidence wasn't a bluff.
Just as he was thinking of echoing Tony's "are we there yet?" Hill took one last turn and stopped in front of a wooden door that looked no different than the several dozen other doors she'd guided them past.
"Here," she said. "And you'd better hope your intelligence was good."
"If it doesn't, your corpse can say 'I told you so' to my corpse," Tony told her, and blasted the door.
The room on the other side matched Natasha's second-hand description -- a windowless octagonal chamber with a domed ceiling and a large circular mirror embedded in the floor. Eight more mirrors hung on the walls, reflecting the light of the green-glowing candles in brass wall sconces. The three devils gathered around the floor mirror were all dressed in pinstriped suits and garishly-colored neckties. Perhaps Tony's earlier words about Hell's lawyers hadn't been that far off.
On the floor at the devils' feet was an odd assortment of items, carefully arranged around the mirror's edge. A bottle of water, a clump of dirt, a small, blown-glass sphere, a bowl filled with some sort of oil. One of the devils was kneeling next to the bowl with a lit match in one hand, but he leaped to his feet with when the Avengers burst in. The match dropped to the floor and flared out. All three devils hissed and bared their fangs, but didn't immediately attack.
"Captain." Wong edged forward to stand at Steve's left. His clothes were singed and one side of his face was red and blistered from a devil's touch. "We need to destroy that floor mirror."
"Got it." Steve threw the shield. It ricocheted off the mirror's surface toward the back of the room, where it shattered one of the wall mirrors and embedded itself in the elaborate silver frame. But the glass on the floor remained unbroken, not so much as a scratch to mark where the edge of the shield had struck. Tony's follow-up blast left only a few faint cracks.
"It's never that easy, is it?" Tony muttered.
The devils had been backing away from the door the whole time. Now one of them spun around to face one of the wall mirrors, and gestured rapidly, chanting something indistinct under his breath. Hill promptly shot him in the back, which made him stutter into silence, but by then the mirror had darkened and something that definitely wasn't a reflection stirred inside the frame. Moments later, the glass rippled like water, and a sorrow-spider the size of a large cat tumbled through to land on the floor with a muted thump. Three more spiders followed in quick succession, just as the rest of the wall mirrors also began to darken and ripple.
"Oh, great." Spider-Woman let out a dramatic sigh. "It's those guys again."
Steve dove into a forward roll toward the far side of the room, where his shield was still stuck in the broken mirror frame. By the time he came up on his feet to retrieve it, there were at least twenty spiders in the room, and more were pouring in from all sides. One leaped for Steve's face, all clicking fangs and dripping venom. Steve knocked it aside hard enough to make it burst against the wall in a spray of gray ichor, then spun around to smash the shield into the nearest mirror on his right. For all its liquid rippling, it shattered like normal glass. Silvery shards rained to the floor, followed by half a spider as the portal it was coming through abruptly closed.
"Break the wall mirrors!" Steve called out. "It'll stop more of these things from coming through!"
"Gotcha!" Natasha launched into a spinning kick and slammed a boot heel into the glass behind her. Tony blasted two at once, then ducked as Jewel darted over his head to break a third one. Peter pulled another with his webs, and the influx of spiders slowed to a trickle. The ones already in the room swarmed to attack, but the Avengers already knew how to fight them, and Hill and her team were catching on fast.
There was one wall mirror left intact. Steve began to work his way toward it, saw Tony turn to do the same from the other side of the room.
"I've got it!" Steve yelled to him. Iron Man's weapons appeared to be their only chance to damage the ritual mirror. With any luck, Tony could get the job done while the rest of them kept the spiders busy. Steve crushed a rat-sized spiderling under his boot, then ducked to avoid a larger one. "You get the one on the floor!" Tony gave a quick, jerky nod and altered his course toward the center of the room.
The three pinstriped devils had retreated to the corner farthest from the door, putting the writhing mass of spiders between themselves and the Avengers. Steve tried to keep an eye on them as he fought, but they made no threatening moves -- or moves of any kind, for that matter -- until Tony came within easy striking distance of the ritual mirror. Then one of the devils pulled something small and glittering from his breast pocket and threw it. He didn't seem to be aiming for anything in particular, but instinct still made Steve leap forward to intercept. The projectile -- a small glass vial -- shattered against his shield and expelled a small, dense cloud of glittering blue mist that rapidly thinned out as it expanded to fill the room. When it reached the walls and ceiling it began to thicken again, coalescing into intensely glowing blue strands that twisted themselves into strings of complex, curving shapes. Steve had only had a few brief glimpses of the Correspondence when Tony was working with it, but he recognized the symbols now.
"Don't look at it!" Even filtered through the armor, Tony's voice held a note of borderline panic. "Everyone look away!"
"Look away to where?" Natasha snapped back.
Good question, Steve thought. The walls and the ceiling were completely covered with the Correspondence now. The floor was clear, but it was also littered with pieces of broken mirrors. As the spiders scurried back and forth, Steve couldn't avoid catching partial glimpses of reflected symbols. He tried to focus on the spiders -- they were the ones he needed to fight, after all -- but already his eyes were starting to burn. A warm drop trickled down his cheek. Steve swiped at it with the back of his hand and saw a dark red stain spread against the brighter red of his glove. His eyes were bleeding.
A shift of light and shadow at the edge of his peripheral vision warned him that a spider was attacking. Steve barely managed to swat it aside in time. His limbs felt suddenly clumsy and heavy with fatigue, as if he'd been fighting for hours rather than minutes. The sounds in the room became muted and meaningless, the colors all faded except for the cool blue glow of the Correspondence. The twisting symbols were endlessly fascinating, and Steve was seized with frustration at his inability to see them properly in the mirror shards.
Look up. The words weren't so much spoken as planted directly into his mind. If he looked at the walls, he could see the Correspondence properly. He could read and know its secrets, which were the secrets of the universes. All the universes, an infinite number of them, he could spend a thousand lifetimes reading and never scratch the surface...
"Steve!" Tony's voice was clear, but it seemed to be coming from a great distance. "Steve, listen to me, you need to close your eyes!"
Why? Tony sounded terribly urgent, but Steve couldn't imagine what could be more important than learning what the Correspondence had to say. Surely, Tony would understand. Whatever he wanted, it could wait a little longer.
"Don't listen to it, Steve! Don't look at it!"
Ignore him. This is more important. This is--
A burst of light filled the room, so searing-bright that Steve's vision shorted out completely. It hurt enough to make him drop to his knees, but it also cleared his head. The intrusive, slithering presence of the Correspondence receded from his mind and he understood what must've happened. Flare. Tony had fired a flare.
It was a temporary reprieve. Already, Steve's vision was beginning to clear. White spots still danced before his eyes, but they were fading rapidly. If he closed his eyes, he'd be useless. If he didn't, he'd be worse than useless. The Correspondence had made Tony walk out of the Sanctum Sanctorum and hand himself over to the Spider Council. There was no telling what it might make Steve do.
He started to rise to his feet, but a blow between his shoulder blades drove him to his knees again. One of the sorrow-spiders had dropped down on him from the ceiling. Now it skittered across Steve's back and over his shoulder, and sank its fangs into the same spot where the beaked creature from the tapestries had mauled him earlier. Steve knocked it to the floor by reflex, but the deep sting of the bite and deeper burn of the venom helped ground him in his own body, gave him something to focus on even as his vision fully cleared. It wasn't as effective as Tony's flare had been, but it was a hell of a lot better than his earlier mental fog. When the Correspondence began to whisper at the edges of his mind again, Steve gritted his teeth and dug his fingers into the wound.
He could see some of the others now. Hill and Black Widow, kneeling in the broken glass, their blood-streaked faces tilted up to stare at the wall in front of them. Spider-Man, face down on the floor, breathing but not moving. Tony, standing in the center of the room, with his armored feet planted on top of the badly cracked but still unbroken mirror. And in front of Tony, blocking Steve's view of the rest of the room, the Spider Council.
It must've come in through the one remaining wall mirror, though Steve imagined it would've had difficulty fitting through the frame. Its compound body was smaller than it had been in the subway, and marked with multiple scars, but it seemed they hadn't done a thorough enough job killing it the first time around. Now it crouched low to the floor and tapped its claws thoughtfully against the stone as Tony spoke to it.
"--The one you really want, right?" Tony was saying. He'd taken his gauntlets off and dropped them to the floor, presumably as some kind of good-will gesture in whatever negotiation he was attempting. "The others are no use to you, no more than any random person whose eyes you might steal in the night. Promise to let them go and I'll come back with you."
"Tony, don't," Steve ground out. Neither Tony nor the Council seemed to notice.
"And why would we want you, little metal man?" There was a sound like nails on a chalkboard as the Council scraped one claw down the length of Tony's battered chest plate. "Are you someone important inside that shell?"
"You tell me." Tony took his helmet off and set it down next to the gauntlets. "You're the one who wanted me the last time."
"Ahhh..." The Council's entire oversized bulk lifted off the floor and sank back again as it sighed. "You are the Correspondence scholar."
"That's right." Tony shuddered but held his ground as the Council lowered another claw to press against his exposed throat. "Do we have a deal?"
The Council scurried forward until a dozen of its faceted eyes were only inches from Tony's face. "The Correspondence doesn't have you now," it hissed.
"I'm protected." Tony indicated the painted symbol on his forehead, lifted his hands to show off his wrists. "But I'll remove the protection if that's what you need. Just let the others go."
Dammit, Tony! Steve balanced the shield for a throw, but held back. Tony was standing too close for a clear shot. And Steve didn't trust himself to throw true just then, not when he was dizzy with pain and devoting most of his energy to keeping the Correspondence out of his mind. Not when the Council could kill Tony with one blow.
"Very well." The Council pulled its claws in and moved back. "We have a bargain."
"The others?" Tony insisted.
"Will be allowed to leave the room once the ritual is completed." The Council sounded amused. "They will still have to make their way out of the building, of course. We cannot vouch for what the devils might do."
"Good enough," Tony said, even though it clearly wasn't. Something was definitely off, Steve thought. Tony was a better deal-maker than that. He had asked for no guarantees, took no notice of the three devils who were now slinking out from behind the Council. Did he have a plan of some sort? What did he think he was doing?
At the moment, what he was doing was scrubbing off the symbols Steve had so carefully painted on, first from his face, then from his wrists. But not from his chest, that one was still hidden by the armor. Was one symbol protection enough? Was that Tony's plan?
If it was, he was showing no sign of it now. Tony walked away from the mirror to stand at the Council's side, and when he turned enough for Steve to get a look, his face was slack and his eyes were blank. He didn't seem to notice as the devils gathered around the mirror.
It took them only a few moments to rearrange their ritual items and to refill the bottle and the bowl. One of the devils set the oil in the bowl alight, while the other two chanted. The mirror's frame began to glow, while the glass within it darkened. A shadow formed and grew larger, as if the mirror was a window and a figure was approaching it from the other side. In the space of a few heartbeats, the figure grew close enough to be illuminated by the glowing frame, and Steve could see the light reflecting off Victor von Doom's armor.
Steve threw the shield, because he had to at least try. It bounced off the glass just as it did the last time. Steve thought he saw a few new cracks appear, but it wasn't going to be enough. One of the devils hissed at him from the far side of the mirror, but didn't move from his place.
"Tony!" Steve yelled. Iron Man was the only Avenger still standing. If Tony had a plan, he needed to execute it now, while they still had seconds to spare. "Come on, Tony, take your own advice! Weren't you telling just a minute ago to close my eyes and fight it?"
Tony shook his head and swayed on his feet, but didn't look in Steve's direction. Had he even heard, or was he just reacting to the Correspondence again? Steve had no way of telling; all he could do was raise his voice over the devils' chanting and keep trying.
"Listen to me, Tony! Iron Man! Remember what I told you before? They'll back down and we won't, that's what makes the difference! Don't back down on me now!"
Tony's legs buckled. He pressed his hands to his temples, cried out, then dropped to his hands and knees as if struck down. His head lolled forward until Steve couldn't see his face anymore, but he thought he'd seen a flicker of clarity in Tony's eyes just before he fell. There was nothing Steve could do from where he was, except call Tony's name again and again. Tony had said that Steve's voice was the only thing he could hear over the Correspondence, but it hadn't been enough the last time. Would it be enough now?
"Let go!" Tony clenched his fists and screamed. "Letgoletgoletgo--" The Spider Council lifted a claw to strike at him, but at that moment, the armor's unibeam fired.
The floor in the center of the room turned into a smoking crater. The mirror tumbled into it, along with all three devils. Tony rolled away from the edge barely in time to keep from falling in after them. He rolled onto his back, still screaming, and fired again. Parts of the ceiling began to collapse. The air filled with dust from the falling stones, so thick that Steve couldn't see Tony anymore. Then again, he couldn't see the Correspondence, either.
Steve's shield was out of reach, his left arm was useless, and his head swam with pain and the numbing effect of spider venom. He moved anyway, made it to his feet, staggered toward the spot where he'd seen Tony last. He saw the Spider Council's dark shadow sway in the billowing dust, scrambling away from the crater and toward the door. The rest of the spiders were scattering in all directions, trying to avoid the falling rubble.
Another burst of light from the unibeam, then another. Tony was bringing the entire room down. Steve had no idea if the ritual mirror could survive this level of destruction, but he suspected it hardly mattered. It was buried under tons of debris now, with more coming down every moment. There was no way Doom was coming through.
Steve managed to stagger three, maybe four steps before a chunk of rock the size of a watermelon glanced off his good shoulder and sent him sprawling to the floor. Getting back up seemed like a waste of effort, so he crawled the rest of the way, until he saw Tony's metal-clad arm in front of him.
"Steve!" Tony's face was blackened with dust and streaked with blood and sweat. "I knew it would work, I knew I could do this if you talked me through it!"
"This was your brilliant plan?" Steve didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Have me yell at you? You're insane."
"Worked, didn't it?" Tony's arm trembled as he raised it to bump Steve's chest with his fist. "You need to go now. I think I took out some supporting walls. This whole place is coming down any moment."
"What about you?"
"I'm a bit stuck." Tony gestured toward the lower half of his body, and Steve realized that his legs were buried under several feet of rubble. Without the armor, Tony would've been crushed to a pulp. With it, he was merely immobilized.
Damn. Even if he'd been uninjured, there was no way Steve could shift this much rock in time. "Can't you move it?"
"Out of power. Hydraulics down." Tony punched Steve's chest again, harder this time. "Go!"
"Stop that!" Steve caught Tony's hand in his. "I wouldn't have left you like this even before I knew I loved you, you really think I'm going to do it now?"
"Steve, please!" Tony looked utterly terrified, and Steve was fairly sure that it wasn't the shower of rock around them that had him in such a state, even if one softball-sized chunk did only miss his head by inches. "We only have a minute or so--"
"And you really want to spend that minute arguing?" Steve demanded. And then, because Tony looked as if he was actually considering it, Steve leaned down and kissed him.
It wasn't much of a kiss. Both their mouths were full of dust, Tony was in no shape to anything but lie there, and Steve only had one usable arm to hold him with. I hope the others make it out, Steve thought, and then pushed the thought aside, because there was nothing he could do about it either way, and he didn't want his last moments to be filled with fear or regret. He was here, and Tony was here, and if he was going to die in the ruins of Hell's embassy -- well, at least he was kissing the right person.
The floor began to shake. Here it comes, Steve thought, and braced himself. But the crushing impact he was anticipating never came. Seconds ticked by, and the shaking stopped, and then Tony was bracing one hand against Steve's chest and pushing him away.
"Steve, we're--"
"Not dead. I've noticed." A gust of wind blew across Steve's face, and his breath caught in his throat, because wind in Lowered Manhattan was never this cold. Steve lifted his head to look around, and realized that the room -- no, the entire building around them was gone. Not destroyed, but truly gone. Around them was open space, beneath them was not stone but cold, damp mud, and Steve had never been so grateful to sit in cold mud in his entire life.
The rubble that had pinned Tony's legs was gone too. Steve levered him up into a sitting position and turned both their faces into the wind. It was still dark, but the darkness was different now. Steve tilted his head back.
"Tony, look up."
Above them, farther away than it had been in years, the sky was full of stars.
Epilogue
Paris, two months later
"So," Tony said, "how about that weather we're having?"
"It's wonderful," Steve said fervently.
They were having a late brunch at a cafe around the corner from their hotel, seated at an outdoor table despite the steady gray drizzle. The striped umbrella over the table kept them mostly dry, and the morning chill made each swallow of Steve's hot chocolate feel twice as welcome going down. Tony, on his third cup of coffee, was dividing his attention between his newspaper and his PDA. Steve just leaned back in his chair and watched the city go about its business around them. The steady stream of cars and pedestrians was reassuringly ordinary, until he looked across the street, where a work crew was busily scrubbing a fifty-foot fresco of Victor von Doom from the side of an office building.
"Stop that," Tony muttered without looking up from his PDA screen.
"Stop what?"
"The glaring. It's only a picture, Doom can't actually feel your righteous disapproval."
Steve tore his croissant in half with a great deal more viciousness than an innocent pastry deserved. "Doom has a lot to answer for."
"Oh, I don't know," Tony said. "If he hadn't taken over the world, it would've been us dealing with that Skrull invasion instead of him. Maybe we should send him a thank you card."
"Don't even joke about it." Steve growled. "I'll take ten alien invasions over the mess we've got now."
In the wake of his deal with Hell and the Masters, Doom had used his new power to dissolve all the world's governments and declare himself the sole ruler of a unified Earth. Now he was back in Latveria, hiding behind sealed borders, his magically-imposed world order turned to chaos. The United Nations, SHIELD, the Avengers, and every other superhero on the planet all had their hands full trying to keep some semblance of order as the world subdivided itself again. A part of Steve wished it didn't have to happen that way, but you couldn't mind-control people into world peace.
"I know what you mean." Tony glared at his newspaper one last time before folding it and shoving it aside. "With an alien invasion, you at least know who the bad guys are and what you're supposed to do about them. Nice and simple, right?"
"Right," Steve sighed. "I could go for a bit of nice and simple in my life right now."
"Really?" Tony gave him a crooked smile. "What are you doing with me, then?"
"Good question." Steve found himself reluctantly smiling back. "What am I doing with a guy whose idea of a brilliant plan is to bring the roof down on top of his own head?"
"Oh, come on." Tony rolled his eyes. "How many times do we get to have this argument? It was a good plan. It worked. We brought Manhattan back and nobody died."
"It was a terrible plan. It only worked because you got lucky. And Hill and Natasha will never speak to you again."
"Sure they will," Tony said confidently. "I'll just have to charm them a little, that's all."
"Once they're out of traction."
"Yeah." Tony's grin wilted a little. "Okay, maybe I'll have to charm them a lot."
"If I were you," Steve said, "I'd keep the charm to myself for a while."
"Maybe you're right." Tony looked chastened for a moment. A very short moment. "Maybe I'll charm you instead." The leer that accompanied the words was not so much charming as utterly obscene. A few weeks ago, Steve might've blushed at it, but he was developing a tolerance for Tony's antics.
"You can try," he said placidly, and sipped his hot chocolate.
Tony's gaze turned calculating, as if he was taking Steve's non-response as a challenge. He started to say something, then swore and patted at his pockets at the same time as Steve's own coat beeped urgently at him.
"Dammit." Tony pulled his communicator from his back pocket and scowled at it. "I swear, every time we get an hour to ourselves, Hill comes up with an emergency. I think she's cockblocking us."
"I'm pretty sure she's not doing it on purpose," Steve said. Tony's scowl deepened.
"She totally is. I bet she and Black Widow are in it together, plotting against us."
"If Hill and Natasha were plotting against us, we'd have bigger things to worry about than interrupted brunch dates." Steve put his cup down, and reached across the table to press the "acknowledge" key on the communicator in Tony's hand.
"Where does SHIELD want us?"
"Geneva." Tony let out an annoyed huff. "Apparently, HYDRA is trying to break up the Eastern European summit."
"Will there be weather in Geneva?"
"Almost certainly." Tony's annoyed glare relaxed into an amused half-smile. "And coffee too."
"Well, that's all right then." Steve stood and pulled Tony to his feet. "Let's go save the world."

Wow! Where to start? ... Keep in mind that the following describes more
the issues you might come across, than the good things, so it's going to
seem FAR worse than it actually is.
Going 32-bit is slightly easier, as you mention, altho 64-bit is getting
more mainstream every day. 100% 32-bit mode uses the generally larger
amd64 cache (normally 1M L3 cache, compared to perhaps half that on most
32-bit only processors), but doesn't make use of the other strengths of
the amd64 architecture, the biggest one of which is probably the expanded
number of hardware registers available in 64-bit mode. x86 has
traditionally been a rather register-limited arch, and the amd64 CPUs in
32-bit mode remain so for compatibility reasons, so the additional
registers only come into play in 64-bit mode. OTOH, for many things,
unless you have more than 4G memory, 32-bit is quite enough and conserves
resources a bit better. For that reason, on archs less register bound
than x86(32), the switch to 64-bit mode often has more downside for many
uses, than it does upside. x86_64, however, due to those extra registers
only available in 64-bit mode and because x86(32) has always been register
bound, with a fairly limited number of them, tends to swing the balance
rather further in favor of 64-bit mode than with other archs -- 64-bit
performance is often markedly better than 32-bit performance of the same
source code on the exact same CPU and hardware, the only difference being
whether it's compiled with -m32 or -m64, 32- or 64-bit. So... yes, I'd
say that while possible, installing only 32-bit Linux on AMD64 is indeed
wasting resources, to some extent.
...
You've obviously been doing your research, and correctly found that the
main issues tend to be in cases of binary-only releases of various plugins
and codecs. If it's available in source-code form, it's generally
available for use in 64-bit mode on amd64. The quote I have chosen for my
sig pretty well gives my position on proprietary binary-only code in the
first place, so the availability or lack thereof of 64-bit binary-only
codecs and plugins is less of an issue for me than for many others, since
I'd prefer not to have binary-only stuff on my computer in the first
place. If it's not available in standardized form, playable with an
open source product, there are other things I can be doing with my time
anyway, and I'll just skip the proprietary stuff. Of course, I recognize
that not everybody has the same strong opinions on the subject as I do.
For these folks, it's useful to keep in mind that the x86_64 arch, amd64
and the Intel version, is the clear mainline successor to x86. Therefore,
32-bit-only binary-only codecs and plugins will be less and less of a
problem, as eventually all popular software products, freedomware or
proprietary, will have 64-bit versions as well. Now that 64-bit MSWormOS
is out of beta (or soon to be, I no longer track MSWormOS close enough to
be sure), 64-bit versions of the various codecs and plugins should be
available fairly shortly, I'd guess.
Before moving from the subject of 32-bit binary packages, I should also
mention that OpenOffice.org has 64-bit issues, or at least the 1.x
versions do. 2.x is supposed to work on amd64. However, note that due to
its size and complexity, OOo is one of the few apps that even many
hard-core Gentoo users prefer to merge the (32-bit) binary package of,
rather than compiling their own copy themselves. Thus, as with firefox
and mplayer (and their various codecs), the 32-bit OOo can be merged, only
it's even MORE widely used and tested than the other bin-pkgs. Of course,
you may or may not have reason to merge and use OOo anyway. I've found no
need for the various Office suites, here, and if I did, since I use KDE on
my desktop anyway, I'd probably try KOffice first.
...
There's one other set of issues specific (in one sense, tho the general
issue affects others) to /Gentoo/ amd64 (as opposed to Fedora or Mandriva
or SuSE or whatever) that needs to be mentioned, the multilib thing, which
Gentoo /currently/ treats a bit differently than most of the other
distributions.
On a dual-32/64-bitness arch, there are often two copies of various
libraries needed, the 32-bit version and the 64-bit version. The method
for how this is handled has come to be referred to as "multilib". The
Linux Standard Base (LSB) / File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) standard
solution uses two separate dirs, lib64/ (thus, /lib64/, /usr/lib64/,
/usr/local/lib64/, etc) for the 64-bit libraries, reserving the
traditional lib/ dirs (thus /lib/, /usr/lib/, etc) for 32-bit shared
objects. (Note that shared objects, *.so.*, are the "libraries" of Linux,
similar in function to the dynamic link libraries, *.dll, of MSWormOS, but
being around Linux for awhile, you already knew that, I'm sure. This is
just for others that may be following along. =8^)
Gentoo similarly uses two separate dirs, but because Gentoo amd64
implemented them before the FHS standard defined the names for amd64,
Gentoo took the opposite approach, reasoning that lib/ should contain the
native bitness libraries, in this case the 64-bit libraries, with the
32-bit libraries in lib32/. The FHS version makes more sense for
compatibility with existing 32-bit packages, particularly binary-only ones
that may simply assume lib/ is 32-bit, while Gentoo's approach makes more
sense (in the absolute, but see below) in an almost entirely 64-bit
system, and moving forward to a time when 64-bit is mainlined.
The problem for Gentoo is that when the LSB/FHS standard was defined, it
/did/ become the standard. Packages now come from upstream with that
assumption, and it's a lot of work, and becomes ever more work as 64-bit
heads toward mainline, to continually patch everything to use the
non-standard Gentoo locations. Individually, it's usually not much work
at all, just supplying the proper configure option, but the work adds up
over thousands of packages, and with the standard defined and amd64/x86_64
clearly going mainline, it's a lot of /unnecessary/ work, moving forward.
Therefore, Gentoo amd64 is currently in the middle of a year or more
process to safely reverse direction, moving 64-bit libs from lib to lib64
(almost done), and eventually, 32-bit libs from lib32 to lib. Currently,
lib is usually a symlink to lib64, so 64-bit packages that haven't been
fixed yet still work if they install to lib. (32-bit packages are handled
a bit differently, as discussed below.)
Another aspect of what amounts to the same issue -- how to treat what
could be duplicate packages installed in both 32-bit and 64-bit mode -- is
dependency tracking. Imagine what happens if the 32-bit and 64-bit
dependency databases aren't kept separate. You go to emerge a 32-bit
package, and it sees the 64-bit libs it needs are already merged, so it
tries to merge, and fails because it's trying to link against 32-bit
libraries that aren't there to link against! Even worse would be the
possibility of merging 32-bit libraries when doing an update, then erasing
the "old" 64-bit versions of the same libraries as unneeded!
Obviously, this will NOT work, so 32-bit and 64-bit package dependency
and current installation tracking must be kept separate. Unfortunately,
current versions of portage, the Gentoo package management system, cannot
directly handle this requirement. Portage-CVS is slated to get this
ability (if it hasn't already been added) by the time it is released, but
current versions are stuck having to work around the issue.
There are a several different ways of managing things, depending on how
many 32-bit packages you plan on installing. For certain core packages,
currently gcc, glibc, and portage itself, the normal 2005.0 profile (which
is multilib, not 64-bit only, tho that's a subprofile option) causes
/both/ the 32-bit and 64-bit versions to be installed, so portage can
continue to track just the single package. The rest of the 32-bit "system
base" libraries are currently normally installed as 32-bit binary-only
compatibility packages (emul-linux-x86-*).
That's the base 32-bit compatibility installation. If you are only going
to be installing binary-only 32-bit software such as games and the
various codecs and plugins, this, and bin-packages such as mplayer32 if
desired, are all one needs.
If, with such an all-binary 32-bit installation you do decide to compile
and install 32-bit stuff yourself, it's *HIGHLY* recommended that you do
NOT use portage/emerge for doing so. Rather, procure the tarballs
directly, and install "manually", resolving any 32-bit dependencies and
installing them manually if necessary as well. Obviously, this will
become a rather huge hassle rather quickly, however, if you have more than
a couple 32-bit packages you want to compile from source.
For those who have a large list of 32-bit packages they want to run,
there's another option, the 32-bit chroot. The idea is to install a
minimal 32-bit Gentoo installation, without system services such as syslog
and cron and without a 32-bit kernel of course, but with all the usual
libraries and the like, and pointedly, with its own 32-bit portage
installation. Because it's in a chroot, this 32-bit portage installation
will be entirely separate from the system-wide 64-bit portage, so the
dependency tracking systems won't conflict with each other, and any
arbitrary package in portage can be merged as 32-bit, without in any way
affecting the system-wide 64-bit dependencies. Note that once this is
setup, it's possible to add the chroot's library and bin dirs to the
system-wide paths, and execute your 32-bit binaries system-wide, not just
within the chroot.
Obviously, for someone only merging one or two 32-bit packages, the chroot
solution is a lot of unnecessary work, but not so much for someone doing
many such packages, where the work of manually tracking dependencies would
quickly become rather unmanageable. Thus, the different choices for
different purposes. There's more documentation on the chroot option in
the technotes and other locations, if you decide to go this route.
Again, let me stress that this current less-than-ideal situation is
temporary, and will be going away, once both the multilib and portage
multi-bitness issues are resolved. In terms of timetable, that now looks
to be targeted at the 2006.0 release. (It was hoped that it would be done
for 2005.1 coming up shortly, but that appears unlikely, now, particularly
for the portage multi-bitness dependency tracking stuff, as betas aren't
out for the next version yet, meaning it couldn't go stable in time for
the next release, 2005.1.)
Again, as I said at the top, the reality isn't quite as bad as all the
above surely makes it sound. In reality, most things "just work", with
the caveat that you understand that 32-bit libraries won't work in 64-bit
applications, and the reverse, which you've obviously already figured out
from your own research, since you mentioned it.
...
Now, some more general Gentoo newbie hints...
Before you start your installation, READ THE GENTOO HANDBOOK!! The first
section covers installation procedures and most folks read that as they
are installing, but it pays to read it thru (for your chosen arch) first,
getting an overview of what you will be doing, before you start. As you
are doing so, figure out which stage install you plan to use. A stage-3
starts from a mostly bootstrapped system is initially faster to get up
and running, but takes longer to get everything fully customized. A
stage-1 install is initially slower and more complicated, but you end up
knowing far more about how a Linux system works behind the scenes, when
you are done. Here, computing is my hobby, not a job, and learning a
primary purpose, so there was no question, I did a stage-1. In fact, I
went even FURTHER than that, and took apart the bootstrap script and
executed it step by step, manually. In doing so, I learned a LOT about
the system I was building than I knew about Linux before, but it DID take
me quite some time to do it..
For the portage tree and sources, you'll probably want 3G minimum, 5G
or more if you use FEATURES=buildpkg (discussed below). As mentioned
above, OOo is the largest package in terms of compilation space needed in
portage, needing some 5G of scratch space to successfully compile. Again,
you'll likely not be compiling it as even x86 folks often use the binary
package for it, but that gives you an idea of the sort of scratch space
normally required for /var/tmp/. (Here, I've changed both those settings
from the default, keeping the portage tree in its own partition mounted in
a different location, and telling portage to use /tmp/ for its work,
rather than /var/tmp/, so it's possible to change both, but I'm giving you
the default locations, above.)
Another very useful hint for after the initial install, after you've
started customizing your config files (/etc/* and the like). Do *NOT*
just tell etc-update to go ahead and auto-merge all the new config files
after an update (the negative options), without knowing EXACTLY what you
are doing. FAR better to go thru each one individually, and see what it's
going to change, then let it make the changes or not as desired, than to
find out it killed your customizations on something critical like
/etc/fstab! (With /etc/fstab itself, that's no longer a problem, as the
package now updates fstab.example instead, but the problem caught MANY an
unwary Gentoo newbie before they changed that behavior, and the issue
still exists with other files.) Just exercise the usual caution you
should exercise anyway when running as root, think about what a command
will actually do before hitting that enter key, and you'll be fine. Fail
to do so, and your failure will EVENTUALLY bite you! Of course, if you've
been running BSDs and Linux for years, this idea won't be at all new to
you, only the specifics as applied to etc-update.
Before you do the install, however, as well as again afterward when you
are actually ready to start working on your new system, I'd suggest
reading the REST of the handbook as well. The working with Gentoo and
working with Portage sections should be quite interesting to you coming
from other distributions, as they are all about what makes Gentoo
different from the others. Learning about how Gentoo's boot process and
dependency ordering differs from the usual numbered init levels with
numbered start and stop symlinks pointing to the appropriate scripts, the
system most other distributions use, is both interesting and educational,
or I certainly found it so, anyway. (Once you actually get a
system up and start investigating, you'll find that in practice,
the init levels are still there. Gentoo just lets you deal with
them by name instead of number, if desired. However, the way
Gentoo's boot scripts resolve boot-time dependencies is VERY
fascinating!) Likewise with how portage works and the many ways to
customize it. It was fascinating seeing how much more flexible it made
things for the typical sysadmin, as compared to the typical rpm or deb
package management system, yet how even with all that flexibility, it
still managed to keep things simple and decently manageable, without
confusion. By reading these things ahead of time, you'll understand far
more about what makes Gentoo, Gentoo, and parts of the install that might
otherwise seem entirely arbitrary will be instead entirely logical and
natural. Reading it again as you actually start working with a running
Gentoo, you'll find things just seem to naturally work the way you'd
expect them to, where otherwise they'd seem just an arbitrary series of
commands that didn't make a lot of sense.
Of course, beyond the handbook, Gentoo has lots of additional
documentation -- one of its strengths as compared to other distros. How
to configure printing, how to configure your sound system, how to manage
udev, all this and more the Gentoo documentation covers in
Gentoo specific step-by-steps that other distributions lack.
One other specific document I should mention: the Gentoo amd64 technotes.
These explain most of the differences between x86 and amd64, both in what
you can expect from the hardware, and in software. Last I looked, some of
the technotes were a bit dated (they still referred to gcc-3.3 in the
future, for instance), but it's still a very good overview, covering
things like the 32-bit chroot option mentioned earlier, and the thing
about OOo, as well as things like common hardware issues and what to do
about them. I'll mention one important note specifically. BEFORE YOU
INSTALL GENTOO AMD64, UPDATE YOUR BIOS from the manufacturer's web site.
Even if the system is new, that doesn't mean it has the latest BIOS, and
MANY have found that the troubles they initially had "magically" went
away, when they installed the latest BIOS. Likewise, continue checking
periodically for additional updates. I had the latest when I installed
Gentoo, but additional BIOS updates since then have increased system
stability and performance, rather more than I would have expected, in fact.
The technotes can be a bit harder to find than the Gentoo Handbook and
other documentation, so here's a direct link: (The
technotes are also linked from the main project page at, which is easier to remember, and has some other
information as well, but the link from there is harder to find, so I
suggest bookmarking the direct link.)
Another useful hint, about portage, this time. You'll understand the
significance of this a bit more after reading the portage features chapter
of the working with Gentoo section of the handbook, but setting
FEATURES=buildpkg in make.conf causes portage to routinely build binary
packages of everything it emerges. This can be very useful for several
reasons. First, it's very helpful if you somehow break gcc, preventing
emerging gcc again to fix the issue. =8^( If you have the binary package
already built, it's a simple matter to remerge the binary package and have
a working gcc again! =8^) If it was an upgrade that broke it, simply
emerge the previous version's binary package rather than the newest! If
portage itself breaks, that means you can't emerge stuff, but since the
binary packages are simply tar.bz2 tarballs with a bit of additional
metadata tacked onto the end, you can simply extract the portage binpkg
tarball directly over your live filesystem, replacing the broken portage
files with good versions, and be back in business! =8^)
However, rescue functionality isn't the only thing binpkgs are good for.
Additionally, it's easy to switch between versions to troubleshoot
something or other, if necessary -- FAR easier than having to recompile an
old version to see if that fixes whatever the problem is, then recompiling
the new one again to get it back. Also, again, the binpkgs are simply
tbz2 files with a bit of extra metadata at the end, so it's easy enough to
go find a binpkg to see what a particular default config file looks like
in it, as compared to your customized installed version, or whether a file
that should exist but is missing, existed in the package as installed (and
therefore as archived in the binpkg), so it got deleted later, or if it
was missing in the installed version as well. Of course, I'm running
~amd64 (the ~ indicating unstable or testing), and in fact sometimes
installing packages before they are even marked testing, testing them
early, so all this troubleshooting ability is more useful here than it
would be to an ordinary stable amd64 user, but it's always useful to have,
none-the-less.
So... hopefully that's all helpful and not too overwhelming... If you
follow this list/group regularly (which I'd recommend, it's not so busy
as to prevent it and ypu'll find useful information on what's ahead from
time to time, even if the usual discussion isn't of interest to you),
you'll find that yes, my replies are /often/ this long and detailed. .

How did you set innodb_buffer_pool_size? you might want to read
and do some tuning.
In case that doesn't help you, you'll need to post more info on your config.

Mileage: 36.6 and 54.5
January mileage: 445.4
Hours: 3:00 (plus 3:00 at the gym) yesterday and 4:30 today
Temperature upon departure: 39 and 28
Precipitation: 1.61 inches!!! (All rain, all yesterday.)
Last week, I received an e-mail from Stephanie at Olympus. She told me she had looked at my blog, enjoyed the cycling/photography concept, and just happened to have in mind the perfect camera for me: The Olympus Stylus 770 SW. She told me she would send me one, no strings attached ... I'm sure knowing that any blogger is going to brag publicly about free gear. But what she didn't know is that I already owned an older version of this exact camera, and had been abusing it quite heavily since April. Even after I told her so, she didn't withdraw her offer. "You'll like to new version," she told me. "This one is freezeproof."
The sparkling new silver camera came in the mail on Thursday. Today I took it on its first ride. Not a bad day for a first shoot, and not a bad little camera. I don't have an memory card yet, and the internal memory limited me to 11 pictures. I decided this was a good thing, because I was aiming for a long ride, and I wanted to keep moving. Instead, I spent way too much time during my ride self-editing my photos. Definitely an amazing, beautiful day.
Juneau had its first sunlight in nine days, coming off a string of some of the crappiest weather January can conjure. I've had people tell me they'd prefer cold winter rain to subzero temperatures. I can't even fathom that. Subzero, rare as it is here, brings all that crisp dry air and clear skies. Dress for it right, and this kind of weather is both comfortable and exciting. Rain and temperatures in the 30s, on the other hand, can only mean one thing to me as a cyclist: That I'm going to be really wet, and really miserable, and I'm eventually going to be really cold no matter what I do.
Friday was one of those "put your head down and ride" kind of days. In continuously heavy rain, especially with the kind of flooding we get against the snowpack, it only takes about a half hour for my outer "waterproof" clothing barrier to be broken. After one hour, I'm soaked through and through. And that's the way I have to ride, in temperatures in the high 30s, a 15-20 mph wind and windchills hovering between 20 and 25, for as many hours as I can endure it. I can usually hold out about three hours without completely changing my clothing. But by the end of the ride, especially if I make a single stop or, as I did yesterday, slow for a while to talk to Geoff as he runs, I usually have to spend the last half hour of the ride racked with chills, hating every minute of my miserable existence. Maybe weeks of unbroken subzero temperatures would teach me differently, but until then, there is no weather I hate more than cold rain.
But today! Today was exactly the shot I needed. Blazing sun and temps just cold enough to refreeze all the slop. I'm on day three of my current long training push ... exercising about five hours each in four consecutive days (a little short today, a little long yesterday.) Either way, it eats up a lot of time. Geoff is training at a similar level right now, and between us, we're putting in more than a full-time job's worth of hours in the selfish pursuit of fitness. We've had to make more and more concessions in the things we normally do just to clear up the time. One of the things we've given up is grocery shopping. I thought it was pretty funny when I was eating frozen ravioli two nights in a row and spooning peanut butter out of a jar for lunch. But I think we've both started to run a bit of a calorie deficit (go figure ... keeping food out of the house is a good way to go on a diet.) I stood on the scale at the gym yesterday and learned I weigh five pounds less than I did at this time last year. No necessarily a bad thing, but I was just beginning to think that a little extra pudge might even pay off during the Ultrasport. Because there's no way I'll avoid running a calorie deficit in that event, and it's not like I'll even notice a little extra junk in the trunk once I slog out there with 60 pounds of bike and gear. This is the excuse I've drummed up to hit the ice cream ... if only we had some.
But where was I? Oh yes, the Stylus 770 SW. I had great fun with it on this sunny, beautiful day. Miles and miles of rubbing up against Power Bars in my pocket has scratched my old Olympus's viewing screen to the point of abstraction. This camera's screen was crystal clear. I am excited to test out its "freezeproof" claims. I already know it's basically bombproof. In August, I inadvertently used my old camera to break a rather rocky fall off my mountain bike, landing directly on the hip pocket that held the camera. I put a gouge in the casing nearly a millimeter deep, but the camera didn't even flicker. The Stylus 770 SW is waterproof, too. It's definitely not a top-of-the-line, professional camera. But I think pro cameras really aren't practical for cyclists. Cyclists need something small, something simple, and something that can endure a 15-foot huck off a gnarly cliff and still take pictures at the bottom. If National Geographic ever comes knocking, I'll go buy something with a zoom lens.
This little point-and-shoot Stylus really is the perfect camera for me. I'm not just being a shill by saying that. I bought the same camera long before Olympus volunteered to sponsor my blog efforts. Does a comped camera make me a sponsored photographer? I guess this is my blog, so I say it does. Be sure to click on the Olympus logo in the sidebar. Yeah Olympus!

the website claims is freeze proof to -14 f. shock proof at 5 ft, water proof to 33 ft, crush proof to 220lbf. not bad for a little camera. And it means more wonderful pictures. Dont get me wrong i like your writing, but i LOVE your pictures.
You didn't need a new camera - the pictures you were taking with the old one were great! I have an Olympus Evolt 500 dSLR and LOVE it. It makes taking great pictures easy. I just happened upon your blog this morning and I've been reading posts all day. Thank you for showing us some wonderful pictures and opening yourself up to strangers (all the way across the world - I'm currently in Bosnia).
I use a plastic cover that protects the writing suface of my Palm device to save the display from scratching. Keep up the fine work.
JT from S.F.
Jill, that's great news. Your older Olympus was excellent, and this new one continues that tradition. So far the photos are superb, sharpness good, color GREAT. It's really the perfect camera for you.
About the cold weather limits, the website says +14 but I believe they are being conservative because because of their specs regarding shockproofing. After all, if you were to drop the camera at -14, (or colder) the damn thing might shatter into sparkly little pieces. So it will work in colder temps, but I wouldn't let it fall onto a frozen lake. Battery issues are another issue.
You have one month to get fat, or at least put on a little extra insulation. You might want to eat more meat rather then ice cream. Sugar buzzed headaches won't do you any good, and will probably mess up your sleep too. Just say no to Diabetic Coma's.
Say, we've got your Alaska weather here in the mid-west (as you've heard from Vito and others) Why don't you buzz on down for some 50 below fun? North of Chicago, it's a mear six below zero this morning but sunny, so I'm going to head out for a short jaunt. I know I will return home frozen to the bone and in AWE of your upcoming adventure. You, Geoff and the others in the race are downright ... well, crazy but in the best sense of that word.
Wishing you all the best~ dave
Free stuff good!
I like the shockproof feature. I've dropped my camera a few times. It didn't come out of it unscathed.
Just when I thought it couldn't get any better. You're one of the best. Keep feeding me the eye candy. I'm hooked.
Frozen ravioli? Peanut butter? Jill, your mother Knows it? Seriosly, the first thing you have to do to cicly so much is eat well!
Congrats on the camera! I've been using the Olympus all-weather cameras for years. I started out with a film one, then I had the digital 410. Now I have a 750. None of them are as bomb proof as the 770 but all 3 of them are still working. I haven't taken any big falls on them although the 410 has a gouge in the case.
I always say I'd rather take pictures of great places with a camera I can put in my pocket than great pictures of the boring places I'm willing to drag a big, fancy camera.
Wow. I'm impressed. That company is smart to let you show off what the camera can do. Thanks for the demonstrations. I blog up in Fairbanks and I need a new camera for my outdoor adventures. Indoor, too. What I want to know is, does it take good close ups?
I really enjoyed your photos once again. What is the glove accessibility factor of the camera? Is it easy to use with mits?
Great photos. Can I save them im my pc?
I`m from Cape Verde and I believe the real thing it`s amazing.
solid! I just got that camera a few weeks ago too. it's my 4th olympus. I tested it out its waterproofness yesterday while kayaking. works as advertised! keep the good pics coming...
Congratulations, Jill!!! Way to go Olympus!!! I know what I'll be looking for next year when I'll be buying a new camera! Thanks for the great blog and pictures, Jill!
Mellan :)
Congrats Jill, well deserved! A good knock-around P&S is worth a lot and your pics are awesome.
I like my 'it-shall-remain-nameless P&S camera'. Last spring I was pre-riding the Koko with jj forging ahead of me. As the sun rose I spotted a great shot and while still riding, pulled the camera out. I managed to take some no hands on the handlebar pics just before the front wheel hit a rut and I was unceremoniously thrown to the ground. The still 'On' camera leaped from my hands and landed with a puff in ankle deep dust and sand about 20 feet away. Ugh!
I used that camera today. One half of the lens cover doesn't ever close but it still works great otherwise!
Ed
Jill, the camera is nice to get ... but remember it's not about the camera. I've been teaching high school photography for 15 years and the best work is always due to the eye, not the camera. Now after saying that, I'm still thankful you received it, and it will make you a better photographer! Your success can be attributed to your hard work. By the way, I like how you shoot into the sun.
Beautiful pictures and great camera.
oh, those pictures are so beautiful! that camera is amazing.
Wild...I have been leaning toward the very same Olympus model to stash in my pocket during mountain biking and snowboarding. Basically, I don't think I'd ever dish out as much abuse as you do, so if it works for you, I'm sure it will work for me.
Why don't you just email back that Olympus chick and tell her that "free camera" she sent has tipped the scale for a blog reader to buy one!
Thank you, all! I really am an advocate of this camera, and have been since I accidentally dropped it into a shallow end of Dredge Lake in June (this was before the crushing mountain bike fall I took in August.) It really does take quality true-to-color and true-to-light pictures, especially for its size, price and perks. I think it's a 7.1 megapixel.
Theresa, I would say its close-up potential is typical of autofocus point-and-shoots. Stand any closer than four feet from your subject, and the image will begin to look fuzzy. But not bad. I think a good example is the picture I took of my cat a few days back. I was holding the camera about two feet over her at the time. This was with my old camera, but I imagine the new one performs about the same.
Also, there's not much zoom. The digital zoom is only a path to pixelation, and the manual zoom doesn't go too far. I think this has been obvious in all of my wildlife shots, where the animals look like little black dots. But I think that's forgivable in a bombproof camera like this. It's like that old adage about the dancing bear ... the amazing thing is that the bear dances, not that it dances well.
Thanks, Jill. I really appreciate the feedback. Your blog is rocking. Love the pics and descriptions of your cycling adventures. Makes me wanna get some fat cat tires. Hopefully my son will be a cycling fool this summer, now that he's four.
I'm coming out of lurk mode to say those are some spectacular photos. I wish I had blogger friends like Steph. :P
Returning to the shadows to continue enjoying the blog. ;)
Hello Jill,
Your picture of Auke Lake and your stories of winter biking made me soooo homesick.
I grew up in Juneau and used to love to ride my motocross motorcycle in the winter. We used to put long wood screws through the "knobs" on our "knobbie" tires then ride on the ice on Auke Lake. We would be going flat out at about 60+ MPH then gradually lean into a corner, crank on the gas and keep leaning until the wheels slid out from under us. Then hold on tight and hold the bike so that nothing caught. At that speed you can imagine the thrill and the sensation of sliding across the ice engulfed in flying snow. Amazingly, we never did get hurt. One guy's motorcycle fell through the thin ice one time though. It was close to the shore. He actually went and got a rope and dove in and hooked the bike and we pulled it out. Thanks for your blog which triggered some great memories.

Camara Mathis is a name you should know. She not only is the daughter of famous judge, Greg Mathis, but she is one of the founders of Edge Magazine. I had the opportunity to sit down with Camara, and really dig deep into what Edge Magazine was all about. I can see her passion and dedication to help young individuals achieve their goals and dreams in life. Take a look at this interview I did with Camara, and find out what it means to be on EDGE:
Ari The Heiress: You started an online magazine called, Edge Magazine! How did this project come about? What made you want to start a magazine?
Camara: I started Edge magazine with two of my friends Iman Milner and Ashley Nguyen. We noticed how the internet was saturated with gossip blogs and negativity geared towards our generation. There aren’t many magazines or blogs that highlight the achievement of young minorities so we decided to create our own. We want Edge Magazine to be a platform for people who are succeeding in everything from the entertainment industry to humanitarian efforts.
Ari The Heiress: I was so honored to be featured in the first issue, along with many other talented people. Every story was inspiring and motivating. Will every edge mag contain stories of young people “making it” in different arenas?
Camara: Yes, our goal is to make every issue inspiring, witty, creative and uplifting. We are releasing our next issue December 1st and our new features are just as driven and motivating as the people in our current issue. There are so many people that go unnoticed from music producers to fashion designers Edge is working to change that. We have a lot of new things in line for December.
Above: Camara Mathis, Tyler James Williams (Everybody Hates Chris), and I at my Encounter 2010 Youth Conference!
Ari The Heiress: What are two principles an Edge reader needs to “Make It” in their career?
Camara: As an Edge reader you need to believe in yourself, appreciate every journey in life and go after your biggest dream no matter how big it is.
Ari The Heiress: Why is it important to join, visit, and indulge yourself with Edge Mag?
Camara: As we say frequently tweet: Be Inspired, Be inspirational, Be on the Edge. The magazine is a platform showcasing success. It applauds people who have achieved some of their goals and gives up and coming artist a chance to showcase their talent. We also have the U.On.Edge section which allows readers to submit videos telling us what inspires them and we will continuously update the style, awareness, and love and relationship columns. When you indulge yourself into Edge Magazine you are not only being inspired you are helping to inspire and encourage others.
Ari The Heiress: I know your going to law school soon! Which is awesome. How will you balance law school and doing Edge Magazine? What advice would you give to someone going to school, and doing their career at the same time?
Camara: Law school starts this week and the assignments have already started to pour in! I believe that with good time management I can do anything. ( Basically no tv or social networks for the next three years of my life lol ) I’m excited for the challenge of school and the growth of Edge Magazine my two business partners are dedicated, creative and ambitious so I know this is just the beginning.
Just stopping by to say Live, Love and Laugh Often! Keep up the awesome work, and may God continue to bless and keep you!

Cats lay an egg against Oregon
It was the worst possible outcome. The Wildcat football team played well for a quarter but were inept in the redzone and fell 49-0 to No. 3 Oregon.
Matt Scott had a rough outing against Oregon.
Arizona needed to play a near perfect game to have a chance to beat Oregon, but did just the opposite. They committed five turnovers, two that went for scores, and could do nothing with the three Oregon turnovers.
Arizona was 0-6 in the redzone. They dropped snaps, had kicks blocked and failed to convert on fourth downs.
Matt Scott was off and looked tight. He made bad decisions and bad throws. When he was making good decisions, he had passes dropped.
He was 22-44 for 210 yards and a trio of picks. He only rushed for nine yards, carrying just five times. It appeared as if Arizona refused to run the read option in fear that Scott might get hit.
The lack of a running game also killed the Wildcats. They averaged less than three yards rushing in the first half, with Wildcat running backs averaging less than 1.5 yards a carry.
Although they surrendered 49 points, the defensive game plan was solid. The Ducks had just 13 points in the first half and allowed just four offensive touchdowns. In typical Oregon fashion, the Ducks got hot in the second half and seemed to be running downhill over the final 30:00.
The sad thing for Wildcat fans, is that the team looked like the better squad during the first quarter. They got the ball at the Oregon 35 and karched down to the Oregon four. The Cats settled for a field goal and the snap was a touch inside and punter Kyle Dugandzic failed to reel it in and the field goal attempt was thwarted.
The next two Wildcat possessions were much of the same. Scott threw a pick in the endzone after the Cats got great field position thanks to an Oregon fumble. The next time the Wildcats faced fourth and goal at the two. Rich Rodriguez tried to call a timeout, but no one acknowledged the wish and Scott was stuffed on a quarterback keeper.
The Wildcats now have to rebound. The fanbase will likely sour a bit, but the Cats have to host 2-0 Oregon State next week and cannot spend time likcing their wounds. They traded punches with the Ducks for 20 minutes, now they need to deliver haymakers for 60.
The season is hardly lost, but they need to come back. They need to realize they blew opportunities against a top-3 team and need to learn from it.

Gambo: From No-No to Go-Go
Originally published: Jul 30, 2010 - 3:08 pm
The Diamondbacks traded Edwin Jackson Friday to the Chicago White Sox for two pitching prospects: right-hander Daniel Hudson and left-hander David Holmberg. Both Hudson and Holmberg were rated among the top 10 prospects in the White Sox organization.
That Arizona traded Jackson is no surprise; that they got two solid prospects back for him and don't have to pay any of his remaining salary is. Jackson was a major disappointment for the D-backs this year and is on the books for $8.3 million next season. He is nothing more than a dime a dozen pitcher. He is 6-10 with an ERA of 5.16. Not very good. There is a reason that Jackson is on his fifth team already in his brief major league career, and that is because nobody thinks enough of him to want to keep him. Jackson is easily replaceable, which Hudson will do for the remainder of the season.
Going forward the Diamondbacks rotation for the rest of this year and possibly next year will look like this: Joe Saunders, Ian Kennedy, Rodrigo Lopez, Daniel Hudson and Barry Enright. In the system they will have Tyler Skaggs, Jarrod Parker, David Holmberg and Patrick Corbin. Skaggs, Holmberg and Corbin are all left-handed. Clearly the D-backs are rebuilding, but they have added quality pitching and depth to their system while moving $21 plus million in salary in the last week. These are things you need to do when you are on pace for 100 losses.
When you factor in the loss of salary from Haren, Jackson, Eric Byrnes, Conor Jackson, Brandon Webb and Bob Howry and add in the increases of $21 million being doled out to players currently on the team for next year's payroll, the D-backs will have roughly $54 million committed to the 2011 salary. Arizona expects to have a payroll of around $65 million next season, so barring any other moves they will have approximately $10 million to spend on a closer and some other pieces. Octavio Dotel could be an option at closer for next season with some of that money.
The D-backs also are actively trying to move Chad Qualls and Chris Snyder. Qualls has drawn some interest from Colorado and the New York Yankees, Snyder from Pittsburgh and Toronto. So, even with two big moves already in the books, the D-backs may not be done yet.

It is rare that Big Raddy struggles to raise enthusiasm for a post but this week has been just so disappointing. Two hard defeats, a dull AGM and another plucky MU victory, all horribly depressing. Apart from our neighbours scraping a draw with a team of chicken farmers and the losses of MC and the Chavs, it has been unremitting pain.
BR on Thursday morning
Just look at his record. This fool has destroyed club after club, admittedly he doesn’t cause the economic ruin that *Arry does, No, what Hughes does is more insidious. He teaches players to perform as he did, with touches of panache which disguise a petty violence – he is the ankle tapper, the achilles tendon breaker as opposed to the leg breaking of Allardyce. At least Allardyce stands up for his crimes to football, Sparky just blames others.
Unfortunately, Rangers have started to improve. The tens of millions spent on new players may not have been wasted as the team starts to gel. I watched their performance last weekend in the draw with Everton and QPR looked good – they could and should have won. Decent ball players, the creativity of Taraabt, some pace and stout defenders…. you know their assets as well as I do. But…..
This game will revolve entirely around Arsenal’s performance. My prayer is that we score early and stop the ill-humour which will inevitably grow should the team struggle. Get the fans onboard, start playing the football we know we can and get back to winning ways.
The signs are that Wilshere will get some pitch-time which is a huge fillip to the fans. So much expectation is resting upon his very young shoulders, but should he be the player we all think he is, then the future is rosy.
My team:
Much depends upon who is fit. What is clear is that somehow we have to create chances for the forwards. In the last two game we haven’t had a sniff at goal. We don’t have the type of strikers who can create their own chances, ours are finishers. The Gervinho in the middle ploy worked for a couple of games but (and I hesitate to say this) he is not intelligent enough to play the role being asked of him – he is no Thierry. We have an expensive CF, play him and let him show what he can do, let Giroud play 90 minutes. Podolski has been subbed in almost every game which makes me question his fitness, so why not give him a 2 week rest?
As to Santos. I feel he has been vilified in the same way that Ramsey, Song, Eboue etc etc have been. Santos is a good player working his way back into the team after a long lay-off through injury, that said, his lack of match fitness is costing us goals, both Norwich and Schalke’s first were as a direct result of Santos not keeping the defensive line; if Gibbs is fit he must start.
Today’s man is just a taster for one of Britain’s great heroes; David Livingstone was an extraordinary man who needs more time than I have today. Instead I will leave you with a picture of his father-in-law, a missionary who established a South African church in 1820.
Three points is a must today. Not just to stop the rot but to condemn Mr Hughes to a P45 (if they exist anymore)
Written by Big Raddy
We must get more attacking impotus from our wide boys today, whoever they may be. The improvement in our defensive stats has inevitably come at a cost to our attacking play with full backs not quite so eager to bomb over half way at every opportunity, and our wingers having to work harder tracking back, which leaves our striker isolated all too often.
We have shown against Liverpool that this more defensive approach can work brilliantly on the counter attack, but we seem to be struggling to alter our mind set when having to take the game to lesser teams. It’s time to take the shackles off the wide players and let them do what they do best. If we can’t do that against the bottom of the league then when can we?
I agree with BR that an early goal would be the key to a big performance, but if we get 30 minutes in without a goal it could be a very long afternoon.
The pre match king well done but i believe Gibbs is still out.
Thanks for the preview Big Randy. I felt the same as you did on Thursday morning. Surely we can’t be that dire again 3 games in a row ? You are right, if we don’t get an early goal the mood in the crowd could get quite ugly.
Morning all
I’m ready, the sun is shining and The Emerates always looks so beautiful in the sunshine. If we play our football and score early that will be good. The team need to get back to enjoying playing together and today is the day ……. fingers crossed
Rasp and I will be at The Tavern from 1.30, see all comers there later.
Thank you Raddy for the large dose of optimism, very much appreciated these days.
I have no views on Hughes, but respect your opinion and shall hate him from this day forward. Santos would not be half as tired if he stayed in his position, instead of charging forward.
Please, please, pretty please Dennis, help!!!!
MATCH FACTS
(source: BBC website)
Good post BR
But I think you are mistaken when you say that “both Norwich and Schalke’s first were as a direct result of Santos not keeping the defensive line.”
The way I remember it the Norwich goal was scored from a long range shot that Mannone spilled and was then tapped in by one Nowich player or another. How is Santos to blame for that?
The Schalke goal again came down the middle in which Vermaelen had nodded off, yet again how do you blame Santos for this?
I obviously do agree that Santos is working his way back to match fitness after a long lay off.
Wow Raddy, that is a forest of facial growth. Even a light trim would have resulted in some serious global warming.
Jack was on the bench at Norwich and Chas told me he played a full 90 for someone on monday, so for me he starts.
Thank you, and I hope you are having a great time in Paris. Students eh!
Good post Big Moody.
Depending on Koscielny (see following analysis)
Mannone
Jenkinson – Mertesacker – Koscielny – Vermaelen
Ramsey – Cazorla – Arteta
Ox-Chamberlain – Giroud – Gervinho
I noticed a comment from KELSEY at the end of yesterday’s excellent post, re Koscielny’s fitness… I had mentioned it also, earlier in the post. I personally think he wasn’t fully fit and would have been used only in an emergency (injury to Mertesacker or Vermaelen). If that’s still the case today, and if Santos is dropped, then maybe the back-four could include (surprisingly) Djourou.
Jenkinson – Mertesacker – Djourou – Vermaelen.
(with Koscielny again on the bench IF he’s not FULLY fit).
@ Ritchie – great stories about Avanull Road and Gran etc, yesterday.
Evonne,
I love your thinking. Something along the lines of: “I know nothing about so and so, but if Raddy says bad things about him, then from this moment forwards, I shall detest every fibre in his spineless body”
Have fun all that are going, and remember to drop a drink and some scratchings over the road to Chary.
If Walcott is fit, I reckon he is nailed on to start.
Just noticed Big Moody’s last comment under the pic of that ZZ Top bloke.
“to condemn Mr Hughes to a P45″
Which reminds me that I wanted to ask you all (some time ago) for your thoughts as regards the first Premiership managerial casualty, should there be one this season. This seems a reasonable time seeing as Hughes is possibly in the running…
Sorry to go off-topic (to a degree), and if this has been discussed on a previous post, then apologies, but my computer had to go into hospital for quite some time recently, and I may have missed it (?).
I can’t get over the idea that Weedonald lives 2700 miles away, I still don’t know exactly where, this came to mind after looking out he window and thinking hmmm it’s a bit windy today the journey may take me 25 instead of 20 minutes to get to the ground.
Hopefully Hughes and Rodgers won’t last the season at lLverpool, Big Al.
Thanks Raddy, once again you’ve summed up my mood for today’s game Victory is vital … end of.
On another note I must compliment everyone on a great day’s blogging yesterday. richie and GoonerB have certainly added something to our content.
Which brings me to richie’s comment @12:30 on yesterdays post. We are blessed with so many friends who have unbelievable provenance in terms of The Arsenal. GunnerN5 and Brigam and several others basically grew up outside Highbury and have fantastic tales to tell … but richie may have eclipsed you
I met a really nice guy at the AGM who also grew up in the area and his whole family are Arsenal supporters. Sadly his father actually died on the terraces at Highbury. Being the pushy sod I am, I asked him if he would like to write his story for the site. He said yes, but was probably just being polite Any way ***, if you’re reading, we’ll be at The Tavern at about 1:30 today if you fancy a beer before the game.
Morning LB, looks like we’re both Theo fans now
I have been sitting on a post about Theo for about a week now but haven’t had the opportunity to publish.
‘Lex Luther to Arsene’s Superman’
Love the rant, Raddy, and thanks for a fine pre-match. You have lifted our spirits.
Rasp,
I had already complimented people on the quality of blogging. Always know that while you sleep, the site is in safe hands
Have a great day, and I wish I was there with you.
Off out now, back to join Cinders and Chums for the game from the sofas.
Since we have acquired so many bloggers who grew up within the sound of the refs whistle at Highbury (as opposed to Bow Bells) we really should have a collective name for them don’t you think? …. HighGunners?
Thanks Micky, I’m sorry I often don’t get the chance to catch up on comments. The early morning club of which you and chas are founder members is always a joy to read back over and as a result I start my day with a smile even if I can’t join in
Micky, sorry you won’t be joining us in the biting wind today – when am I next likely to enjoy your company (and some tasty Turkish cuisine) at a game?
How about Goonbury’s!
Hi all
I’d love to know who would like to write the match report before I go to the game ……… any offers?
Goonbury’s – love it, do I count even though I left the area when I was 6
We know it will be a 4-3-3 system but I like your line up BR. You know I feel that Giroud often doesn’t get the players in close enough to him to support at times, and he ends up looking isolated. As the game becomes fluid I would love to see us at times getting Theo or the ox in tighter to Giroud for support with the midfield 3 moving one place to the right so that Le Coq becomes almost a right winger, and Gervinho coming more to the left flank. It turns it more to a 4-4-2 and I am not suggesting we should stay rigid to that formation throughout the game, but adopt it at times during the game to give Giroud more of a strike partner if you like. Anyway just leaving work so must dash to get the train I want.
Hi GoonerB, you leave me standing in terms of your tactical and positional knowledge.
I certainly want to see Coquelin on the pitch today, even if it is at the expense of Ramsey. Some of his tackling was fantastic on Wednesday and he has greater skills/tricks than Theo. I can see Coquelin being a top player in the future.
My line-up would be:
GK: Mannone, CBs: Koscielny/Djourou & Vermaelen, CB(Sweeper): Mertesacker
RWB/RM: Jenkinson, LWB/LM: Santos, CM(Holding): Coquelin, CM(Box-to-Box):Arteta, CM(Advanced): Ramsey, CF(Main): Giroud, SF(Side-forward): Cazorla
Subs: Martinez, Djourou/Koscielny, Gervinho, Podolski(rested), Walcott/Arshavin, Sagna, Wilshere/Gnabry.
Tactic: Attack from Right flank, Containment in the middle, Decoy along Left flank.
Arsene’s line-up should be 4-3-3(Defensive) of course.
Morning all, hope you’re all in good shape!
Have been reading what’s been an excellent week in terms of quality of this blog and mourning what has been a woeful week in terms of quality of performance on the park…completely unable to be rational when I’ve tried to post so have avoided it! But let’s not dwell on that…
Raddy – great to call out Hughes on what he is…a neanderthal who hides his vile ways under a veneer of civility…he’s a cretin and always has been…
Today’s another day, folks – a good win today could set us up for (shock horror!) a good November. Wrap up warm ‘cos in spite of the sun it’s BITTER cold out there and bring your singing voices!
Thanks Rhyle and JM, I have been toying with the idea of having a sort of league table of team selection predictions. Poor Raddy always has to put his head on the line in his PM …. the only trouble with the idea is it will involve me in more ‘behind the scenes time’ so I’ll only instigate it if there is enough support for the idea.
Right off to the game … catchup later …… and happy I hope ……..
I’m still holding out hope that Wengers words at the end of the last TW will ring true in January. I still don’t think he has finished moulding this new squad and we may see a few outs in January and hopefully 1 or 2 ins if he can find the right players.
Fab match preview as always BR
i’m looking forward already to your Livingstone tribute!
Rasp, the line up prediction is a great idea. The fantasy league is interesting enough, maybe we could have a score prediction league too, soon you’ll be running out of space for the widgets.
Anyway i am hoping Santos doesn’t get a game as QPR will target for sure when its bus comes out from parking.
My team
Vito, Jenks, BFG, TV, Bac, Mikel, Coq, Caz, Gerv, Giroud, Ox/Theo
Shoot on sight please.
TV & Santos probably – stay in defense please.
Gerv/Ox/Theo get in the box with Giroud when the ball is on your opposite flank please.
Arsenal win please.
4.1
@GIE from last post. They were such different times Charlie George was a local lad who played football in Highbury Fields with my uncle, Johnny Radford lodged with my gran Pat Rice’s brother was the barber and the team often trained in Clissold Park. They drove Ford angla’s
I remember it was such a big thing when Sammy Nelson bought an Alfa Romeo. It was like how did he manage to save up for that? Who’s he think he is anyway with a bloody Alfa?
Now the average players drive a car worth a house.
Final plea for a match report before I leave ………. anyone?
Micky – don’t know if you are just taking the piss, which I presume you are, but to be honest with you I didn’t hate Tony Pullis or Cambridgeshire referee Darren Deadman until I met GiE, or Martin O’Neill, or Orcs until you lot poisoned my little mind
I was on a tube half hour ago, lots of fans getting off at Finsubury Park, all very somber faced
I think we are bracing ourselves for the unspeakable
No Evonne, not taking the piss at all. Au contraire, I like the cut of your jib
Well, I have not heard a good reason why Jack cannot start. So Jack starts for me.
There will be a bus in town, so a cute passer will be handy. His presense will also lift spirits on and off the pitch.
I assume they’ve got two big oiks at the back, so I’d attempt to play along the ground and through and past the bloody apes.
Therefore its:
…………Vito
Jenk Mert Verm Miqu
…..Santi Art Jack
Theo Pod Gerv
Off again until KO
@ LB10:26 I hate to have to remember this coz I’m trying to forget but Santos played Holt onside otherwise he would’ve been off-side for his tap in that Mannone spilled. Thats whats meant by him not keeping the defensive line.
Big thumbs up on the match report B Raddy, always a delight..
An early goal would be just the tonic me thinks, and i would gladly sacrifice the sexy football for a guaranteed 3 points..Its backs to the walls time and we must stand up and fight, show those loftus fools whos house they are in and get our respect back even if its ugly on the eye..
No Retreat, No Surrender!
Up the Arse
Just for you Micky, jack starts.
All you Gooners out there, where ever you may be, Enjoy the game, block out all the negatives and keep the faith !!
Remember even ‘titi’ was a flop in his first 8 weeks….. Miracles do happen and the stars shall align again…MAGIC-its the Arsenal way
Mannone, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Santos, Arteta, Wilshere, Ramsey, Cazorla, Podolski, Giroud.
subs: Martinez, Koscielny, Jenkinson, Coquelin, Walcott, Arshavin, Gervinho
Hi Jack, Hows your back? Havnt seen you for ears and ears but i still knows your cheeky
Ive got my coat…..
Thanks Kelsey
well lets hope santos is going to get some help from TV & midfield
Has anybody got the stats:- games we have won this season with Ramsey and games we have won without Ramsey?
@LB further to the previous point if you wanna confirm how Santos didn’t keep the defensive line check out
Off now KO close.
I thought Santos was chosen to play on the left flank
Didn’t expect Sagna or Wilshere to start.These are risks which i hope comes off. No real pace on the flanks but let’s hope we stuff toillett and co down the toilet.
That’s good Kelsey.
Theo on the bench (so fit) mmmm
Oh well, show us what you do best Arsenal.
Come on you Gunnnnnners
Damned if you do, damned if you dont..Sometimes i dont envy Arsenes job..
COYRRG!!
Reddawn you don’t really want to know, just enjoy the game
If we keep Granero quiet we kill the supply to Hoilett..its elementary my dear
Crakcing pre match and fantastic picture
What do we do best,Micky
Aren’t you there sharkey ?
He’s back! He’s back! Jack is back!!!!!!!!
mouth watering and ox on bench…unbelievabubble
how are you Oz?
Love the gravatar btw, smells like teen spirit= youth naivity?
Oh yeah PPP everything is right in the world again. Jacks my favourite gunner, pod was my favourite none gunner but now plays for us. All thats missing is the trophies (not long of a wait though.
Yourself?
Raddy was right, they are already kicking Sagna. Gosh I hate Mark Hughes
hi oz and ppp
haha cheers, just showing everyone what BSR really thought of as a young boy
oh no Oz, I just enlarged your gravator, yuk
great…it’s Evonne, lets go PPP. haha hi, hope all is well Evonne!
Confident on that front as well! Other than that heaps busy with work and holidays round the corner, although evryhings fine when your still breathing in the morning and our Gunners are on track. Im easily pleased
Come on boys, stand up and be counted!!
Hi Evonne, hows the sofa?
hey that CD has sold millions. get your mind outa the gutter!
agreed PPP, that’s all that matters
Jack is the secret herbs and spices
sofa safely away from the wall with ample space to hide
it’s freezing cold in London, but the atmosphere seems hot hot hot
Jack!!
We lose an attacker as Podolski has to track back and cover Santos, therefore he won’t last 90 minutes.
Evonne during the game:
very good point kelsey,it’s very frustrating. Santos looks like he has no confidence at all!
Oz
tough times call for tough meassures
3 times their keeper has already spilled the ball and each time only one forward in the box to take advantage to no avail.
foul??? what!
jacks shot had santi and giroud both running in
C’mon Arsenal.. lets sheke off this pre-season mode
You don’t need to be a genius to figure out that Ramsey on the right DOES NOT work.
sheke *shake
tomAto tomato
ppp = dumbass
what the hell! this umpiring is an f’n joke. nelson gets one,ramsey gives one for touching a bloke then nothing for getting flattened!!!
Bit worrying that we look more nervous than the bottom team.
This is a bit disjointed but already better than Naaarch and Schaaaalke.
We know our weak link, QPR have the same weakness in traore so take ramsey off (not needed ) and put on walcott
Not a bad call Kelsey, but Ramsey is doing a lot to keep Taraabt quiet.
you can hear a pin drop in the emirates ….
not right
agreed rocky, more attacking intent but still not the same Arsenal. Jack is a star though. I forgot just how good his close control was
Bolleaux!
Why couldn’t the keeper spill it that time, with OG a yard away!
PPP
Crowd are as nervous as the team, hence the atmosphere.
I know Rocky, i understand but you know its not right.. We are at home and it seems as though our opponents no longer fear us.. Your right, we look disjointed but i believe we will wrap this one up, but alot needs to be done on the training track..
Put into perspective we have now played what where the bottom two teams consecutively and it ain’t great..
First half performance started brightly and then slowly lost our urgency.giroud may well turn out to be a goal scorer for us,but for the moment we are screaming for a striker.
Sagna and wilshere both look fully composed and that’s a big plus.
Kelsey 2.59…no I;m 95% armchair these days. 3 games a season is about my limit in recent years.
The more children I have the less I go. Shame really cos theres a new train line from me in Sth London straight thru to H&I. It used to be real trek* to get there with buses tubes and trains
* Said with apologies to those coming from Notts, Cornwall and Norfolk
Oh and Kelsey… if I look at Bob Moffats pic upside down it really could be you !!
Oh yeah the game….
Decent game, but we need to maintain the higher tempo for longer periods..not just short bursts.
Don;t even wanna think about how flat we might have been without Lil Jack
I sense tension?
And me not watching the first half has not led to a change of fortunes, although we haven’t conceded so that’s a good thing right?
Cracking prematch as ever Raddy, I despise Hughes, but not as much as Pulis. Hughes used to annoy me when he was City manager the way he peacocked around the touch line as of he was a mercurial managerial talent, rather than what he was a lowly track suit manager who had lucked out into a club that got bought by the worlds richest family.
Sharkespeare I have it on good authority that this was Kelsey in his hey day!
tension GiE? hmm, its simmering at the moment, along way to go to get to the boil. We are missing the spark plugs, and safe is not our style…it works against us.. all text book for now
great pre-match big daddy. you never let us down
they are targeting Wilshere
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO JACK…doesnt look good, hope its just a knock
Flash backs of swansea last season away..
Cmon Kick start my Heart
Hurry up with the subs, please
There are hints that Wilshere-Santos could turn into something really special.
come on pod! you’ve got this
Poldi territory top right pleeeeease!
is it just me or did those youtube vids of santi scoring free kicks leave you thinking he will score everyone?
I feel so let down when he misses!
Granero should be off
Traore you bloody rabbit stop jumping around like a twit!
Now you get punished for a perfect tackle..Refs a bimbo
Bring on Ox for Rambo and spread em, making space for Giroo
Ref’s rubbish.
that sounded awful PPP haha
Sagna is class
Jack off.
Theo on.
Ramsey into the middle, presumably.
GLiC would be proud
Jack off? Me no like
Need to grind out a win here, one way or another.
QPR have a lot of players with stupid hair.
16 min to go, at home against another bottom of table team.. i should not be worrying like this..cmon boys DIG DEEP
Gobsmacked
Oh Santi
Should have at least been on target.
OK – they’re down to 10 men, which the headline writers will enjoy if we fail to win.
Gerv off on a stretcher. Oh dear.
AT LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!
ARTETA!!!!!!!!!
pinball purrfect!
actually Thank God…my palms are sweaty
Well done Arsh.
Bloody ell that was like pinball, quality cross by Arshavin, think Arteta was offside at some point though, but not on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th phase of play
Think you’re right about the offside GiE – but no mention from the commentators.
good boy Rambo
We’ve ramped it up well these last 15 mins or so.
Its opened up heaps Rocky since the sending off
Wow, that was a lucky let-off.
We need to focus and see this out
Just for once do you think we could stick it in the corner flag and hold it?
Great stop Mannone
Rocky can’t understand my commentators
Mannone just saved our bacons.
Ref is very very poor.
Phew…
Thank Dennis for that.
The result was all important today.
3pts !
what a relief….pheeeeew
phew…..
Not an overly convincing performance, but it would have looked a lot different if we had been coming off the back of two wins instead of two defeats.
There’s lots to work on, but it was an improvement on Norwich and Schalke.
lol its a hatrick of phews
Haha evonne and GiE… a lot of “phewing” going on.
The best thing the ref did this evening was ‘blow the full time whistle’
it was at times ugly, but im a happy chap.. Told you it was similar to Swansea last season when our challenge kicked off and snowballed to Christmas.. This is the same… And we will beat the Manure scum on their own cow paddock!
Happy days again
An offside goal is exactly what’s needed when things aren’t going too well!
A ragged performance with Jack the massive highlight. Great to see him and Sagna back, and it wouldn’t be players returning without another injury to put us back to swuare one! Hope it’s just a knock for Gerv.
Great result, very average performance, and a game that will only be remembered for Jacks return. My weekend will better than last week!
Up to 4th
Man of the match…I suppose their keeper
Winning ugly is an understatement. very grateful for the three points but on the whole a very disjointed performance. A lot of improvement needed and not sure if this win will boost confidence.
Not a match i would be eager to watch again.
I said earlier they were bruisers and at what cost.we will find out later.
Jack looked class in his first full game, it’s the striking department that worries me.
Ha Ha, just said “I wonder if someone has posted a Phew”
Can’t stay and chat as there are extra DidIt’s in the house.
Absolutely essential three points.
Phew ROLF
Nite or bye all.
Any win will bring confidence. Thought Giroud was unlucky with that towering header before Arteta got it in, good to see bodies in and around the box.
Thought Rambo looked good from what i saw of him last 40 minutes. Does a lot of unnoticed and unrewarding work.
Arshavin has that touch of class and nous which is worth having on the bench, and maybe if we find the right system even a starting place.
If we assume it is best to have our best players on the pitch, could we somehow re shape our 4-3-3 to include the likes of Arsh who sit on the bench.
I rather like the idea of 4-2-3-1, but i’m not sure the boss will.
Just to illustrate:
………..Arteta…………Jack……………..
…..Podolsi….Cazorla…..Arshavin…..
……………….Giroud……………………
Or maybe with Pod up top, Jack in the three and Ramsey sitting next to Mikel? Obviously Diaby would be preferable when fit.
Feel sorry for Jenks today, didn’t think he deserved to be dropped so quickly, but a bit of experience on the pitch was probably essential today.
GiE
Jenks didn’t deserve to be dropped, but Bac was outstanding. Put in some great crosses and defensively rock solid.
OG had a really, really good game up front, holding the ball up against a very big, physical team.
Santi and Arteta also very good.
Their ‘keeper played well – we could have had three or four.
Bit worrying that we gave them two very good chances after going one up.
BR
Belatedly – thanks for another superb prematch and another top beardsman.
I love when we get our game out of the way early, and bag the 3 points.. Now we can sit back and watch the others drop points, well some of the contenders..Today is esentially a 6 pointer
mad celebrations behind my sofa followed Arteta’s goal
I was reminded that it was only QPR we were playing. But frankly, a bus is a bus regardless if it is from Sutherland, Norwich or south of the river
I agree about Arsh, GIE but we don’t seem to have enough forwards to score, who can last 90 minutes. One of our previous strengths two seasons back was that we would really press with the attackers until the final whistle .
10 men or not, they looked more dangerous after we scoredwith 6 minutes + left. surely lessons can be learned from that..
Hopefully Kelsey hopefully they will take my instruction at 4:48 (ie stick it in the corner and hold it).
Remember a few seasons back when we didn’t see a game out in that way and Wenger said he couldn’t stop the team trying to play football (almost put it down to the impetuousness of youth), today we had enough experienced heads who could go and keep it in the corner.
Wow, this site is a breath of fresh air
Good to see our team getting their belief in their abilities back, with a grinding 1-0 London derby win.
Regarding Arsene’s 4-3-3 system, we are in the same company as Barcelona, Juventus, Lazio, PSG & Ajax.
Next match, Reading (to build momentum) and then onwards to Man Utd.
Have we got the players to make it work JM?
Wenger: “Wilshere, overall was quite positive, still lacks rhythm but he’ll get that. Gervinho, ankle problem – doesn’t look good”
“It was amazing to be back – words cannot describe it. I was just running around smiling. It’s great to be back.
“Last time I played it was with Fabregas and Nasri – now it’s with Artata and Cazorla who are great players too. It’s like a new team and I’m like a new player.”
Garth Crooks….talks a load of shite:
“Any manager other than Arsene Wenger at Arsenal would have got the sack. He is rebuilding but the rebuild for me is too slow. But in Arsenal’s credit today they worked their way back into the game and got the points that, really, I’m not sure they deserved.”
Right i’m offski for a Curry. See you all later.
Ramsey for me just doesn’t work in that right wing position, he’s too slow with the ball and getting past players/crossing isn’t his strong point too. Walcott did a much better job in that position the minute he came on. He upped the tempo just that little bit too, honestly hope he will sign a new contract ASAP along with Sagna who had a really good game. Wilshere was class too considering that this was his first league game in 17 months. It is clear that we still need an out and finisher and this should be Wenger’s #1 priority in the upcoming transfer window. Nevertheless, a very scrappy win and honestly Wenger needs to work his magic and get this team to start clicking together again before that match at OT next weekend. Wouldn’t want Van persie rubbing it in our face would we? In fact, Wenger might even want to give the first team another go against Reading just to improve the cohesion factor and to get this team clicking again.
By the way, Julio Cesar just showed us what a really good keeper could contribute to a team. Wenger might want to take a hint and start sniffing around for DECENT GKs either to back Sczesny up while hes out or act as a deputy as I feel that its a matter of time before Fabianski and Mannone leave.
Adrian
On the goalkeeping side, to be fair to Man One, he saved us at the end. It wasn’t a spectacular save but it was all about positioning and staying “big”, which he did very well.
And a lot of the reports are a bit schizophrenic: apparently we were pants, but QPR’s ‘keeper had a great game. Bit of a contradiction there, surely?
We were far from fluent, but a 3-0 win would not have been unjustified based on chances.
As I said earlier, if this performance had come after a couple of wins in previous games, we would be talking about it as a professional job, grinding out a good result without being at our best and so on.
Obviously the context of two p*ss-poor performances colours how many people view today’s outing.
Adrian is a really good keeper one that makes good saves?
Mannone’s one on ones saved the three points
Sorry that should have been multiple choice:
Is a really good keeper:
A) one that makes a lot of saves
B) one that makes great saves
C) one that doesn’t have to make saves cause he deals with the cross
For me it’s B and C. I think a really good/great keeper is like Schmeichel, Seaman, Kahn, or Southall. Maybe Buffon in the modern game is in that league.
Well said Rocky, and on that thought i would like to rest my head and say goodnight.. About 2hrs ago i asked Dennis for a win/3 points.. i did not care how i got them, i just wanted a building block and we got it, every Gooner on this planet would have taken a 1-0 to the Arsenal pre match.. Smiling today, and RoLFing 2moro when the spudz produce a knee-jerk loss
I might have phrased that wrongly, Julio Cesar not only made quite a few saves but made a couple of great saves as well, the most notable one being that rebound shot from just a yard out. Mannone’s performance today was decent as he didn’t have much to do, but he isn’t fully convincing yet as shown in his previous games.
Night P
Julio Cesar said after the game “QPR was not built in a day”
Kelsey
Have you come to bury him, or praise him?
Very good Kelsey.
I’m just home ………… anyone offered a match report????
I havent thought about it yet, but who do we want to win tomorrow, chelsea or united? I guess united?
jnyc
I guess a draw or (chokes on words) a ManUre win.
i think you will do a very good job at a report peaches, you were there .I am 1761 kilometres away
as weedonald would say.
There is still a lot of negativity about today’s performance (not here, thankfully) so, for some context:
Match Stats (Arsenal first)
Possession: 70% – 30%
Shots: 21 – 4
On Target: 11 – 3
Corners: 5 – 2
Yet Mark Hughes says QPR were in complete control and ‘the least they deserved’ was a draw.
How much did QPR pay for Cesar.? I thought it was minimal or even free, but i maybe wrong
RL,
another 5 minutes and they might have got a draw
Haha – true Kelsey
But it might also have been 2-0 to us with an extra 5 mins as they were wide open.
We’re second on MOTD
kelsey – have you follwed me, I followed you
Not a performance to boost the teams confidence. Against eleven it looked as if one point was the best we could hope for. In fact against ten, we conceded two great late chances to QPR, both through shocking defending.
Evening all, A well earned victory. We started without wingers and lacked pace up front. Ramsey put in a very good shift but he’s not quick enough for a winger – but not his fault he was played out of position. On the other side the Pod was not happy with Santos and barked at him quite a lot. I’d imagine that was because he couldn’t go forward when he was constantly called upon to defend.
We looked so much better with Gerv on the left, Theo on the right and Ramsey in the middle.
Jack played really well and looked our most attack minded midfielder. Hope Gerv’s ankle injury is not too serious, but fantastic to have Sagna back (he was very good).
Either Cazorla is still a bit off his game or perhaps opposition managers now set their stall up to stop him conducting our play.
Arteta was imense throughout and is my MotM
Great to see TMHT, GliC, VCC, chas and GoonerB at the rub-a-dub
yes i have, peaches
I see you changed a word rasp
This is what i was debating with richie yesterday about playing players out of position (when you mentioned ramsey)
Evening all, hope all our well? At least 3 got three points today and that was all that mattered today……
Equally pleasing today was getting a lovely text from Peaches, miss you all at the matches, hoping that I will be able to get myself to one very soon, so missing it, even if the football has been a tad awful at times…….
One interesting side note today, there was 3 champions league winners out there today, none on our side…..
And Jack is back…
Hi Harry, great to hear from you. Hopefully we can hook up at a game real soon.
I think Mannone should be heaped with praise, he made several important saves and generally dealt with crosses well.
Come on …… someone must want to write about our first victory for three weeks …………
Yes that would be good rasp, it so hard at the moment, these are the first CL matches I have missed at home for about 6 or 7 seasons, i think……so miss it……….
What was the atmosphere like today?
martin wen you gonna grow some balls?
I can see what Rocky means about split opinions on the game, I only watched the second half of the second half. What I saw looked ok going forward against a typically belligerent away defence at the Ems, we were a tad wasteful in fronts of goal, even when they had 11 men.
We had 14 shots before the red card (5 on target), and according to 442 stats app another 8 after that (4 on target).
Kelsey has already volunteered Peaches read 7.51.
I look forward to reading it.
A common gripe has been our inability to grind out results when playing below our best. Today we managed that and now people will comment that we didn’t win in style! Then when we win in style, people will moan that it style doesn’t win trophies!
It’s a funny old game…!
I’m going to enjoy these 3 points just as much as any. Have a great weekend Gooners.
Oooooo, a kelsey match report, how exciting!
An interesting game I thought, but how fickle are the footballing gods when they apportion there quotients of luck. Last week Mannone pushed one out and it went straight to an opposition player and cost us three points, this week Cesar pushes three out, not one goes to a red shirt and the ball is scrambled away.
Fortunately a blatant offside is missed by the Ref who allows the goal and we still collect three points.
Sparky is his normal charming self and accepts our good fortune with equanimity and grace as per the Sir Red nose school of footballing etiquette.
Early days yet but a confused league this season seems certain to cause much anxiety and uncertainty among football fans across the country. But us top four? Well the boss man says so and he has been right a few times on the bounce now, has he not?
Guess that will do for me.
By the way enjoyed your rant yesterday Kelsey and BR’s usual pre match quality today. Thanks guys.
Kelsey didn’t offer to write the match report, he was responding tom a question peaches asked him, we still need a volunteer
Thanks Rasp, you’re right, kelsey was responding to my question about following me on twitter…………….
……..so a volunteer is still needed to write a match report please.
I’ll put a match report in drafts Peaches.
Wow that deadened the site a bit peaches. 4 hours without a comment haha.
A lot of great comments made tonight. Particularly liked GiE’s formation. I’d definitely like to see a lot more of Arshavin. Hopefully gerv is okay, otherwise we will have no choice but too.
Are our subs warming up enough/properly before entering the game because first Ox, and now Gerv. Or just coincidence?
Oz
Ox’s injury was nothing to do with warming up – he got twatted in the hip by some big Norwich lump.
And Gerv got a kick on the ankle.
And by the way Oz, I notice that you laid low until I volunteered to do the report
I don’t want to cast a shadow over Rocky’s efforts as the poor chap is probably huddled around his paraffin lamp, nib in hand, as we speak, but….
Do we always have to have a match report. It causes Peaches match day worry, kills the site, and yet this is meant to be fun.
Everyone saw the game afterall.
If someone wants to, then brilliant, but feeling guilt is bad. What terrifies me the most is pissing off the sites’ most prolific and accomplished author (Rocky) and effectively relying on his good nature.
Oh bugger, the clocks have changed haven’t they!
Forwards or backwards? I’m confused, although I think I’m stuck on Islamabad time.
i kind of agree with that micky and everyone will either have seen the game live or on TV or at least highlights and all we need if peaches and rasp want a new post every day is just a few thoughts about the game as invariably as the day goes on we drift into different aspects of the game or individuals.
i have sent in two posts this week which for me is a lot and if I was doing a match report today it would have been quite blunt.
In a sentence: we got 3 points,Wilshere and Sagna were a pleasing sight to see return but otherwise not a game that will stick in the memory.
I have my own thoughts about the squad and it appears especially when looking for
a result we have more cameo players than regular 90 minute players
.The debate is, is that rotation or aren’t some players fit or good enough for a whole game , or otherwise is squad depth just not a standard of a club looking for trophies or at the least a top four position, even allowing for injuries.
Haven’t seen the game yet so cannot comment but delighted we won.
Bloody freezing in Gay Paris and
Spring forward, Fall back
Kelsey. It is too early to be so cheerful
Morning Kelsey and Raddy.
Interesting point about cameo players, Kelsey.
Thing is, we are where we are, and right now this is our squad, so how to get the most out of it. Next up Reading then Utd.
I’m always of the view that the League Cup should be for come-back players and fringe players, but this time I’d send out the first team for 45 mins only.
We need more playing time, particularly for the attacking side of our game to try and find some rhythm and understanding ahead of Utd.
Raddy,
Which Arrondissement are you staying in?
By the way Kelsey, you asked what I meant by The Arsenal “doing what they do best”…I can now answer that:
1-0 To The Arsenal
Kelsey,
I do think a posible answer to one small part of your multi-layered thinking lies in the contracts of certain players and how this cocks up possible transfer movements. Of course I’m thinking of Bendy, Chamakh, Theo and even Arshavin.
Exactly Micky, so does that mean Wenger is being stubborn and some of those players aren’t being selected even though they could add strength to any given game. Can we afford those luxuries ?
Multi layered thinking
Look you know how I feel. I don’t think we will make top 4 this season for a multitude of reasons, but I may not enjoy many games at the moment but you know I support the club and as GLIC said maybe I am frustrated ,and personal issues are clouding my judgement.
You have to be gentle with me, I am aging
Didn’t see the whole match, watched the highlights last night and they picked out Jacks return for special coverage, he looked every bit as good as i remember.
Some people will argue that we shouldn’t rely on a 21 year old, but for me of you have the best young player in the country theres no shame in relying on him.
Just watching highlights of City v Swansea…..a lot of empty blue seats
I did nothing of the sort Rocky! I’ll have you know I was about to offer then I saw your comment so I gracefully withdrew my proposal haha
Micky due to the injury risks I’d be sticking out reserves in the League Cup.
Still be reasonably good squad.
Twitter rumour mill suggests Szczesny avail for United not Gibbs. Lots of talk of Verm going to left back. Think I’d probably stick with Santos.
My hopes for today’s result:
Chelsea – Utd DRAW (plus twenty man brawl)
Saints – Spuds HOME WIN
Toon – West Brom HOME WIN/DRAW
Toffees – Dippers DRAW/AWAY WIN
Then we will be 4th and I’ll wonder what all the fuss has been about
Berbatov was immense for Fulham yesterday, how interesting. Schwarzer was shit.
Slim – spot on. We have critisized ourselves for not being able to do a Manyoo and win while playing rubbish. Yesterday we proved that we can grind results. A win is a win is 3 points, end of.
GiE – you are such a sweetie
May I add a couple of broken legs for the Chelsea fixture? One on each side will do me
yes, Sagna and Jack were great. The filthy bastards targeted Jack in the first half, but a yellow card stopped them from injuring him.
I’d be interested to see what everyone’s strongest XI would be. I think there would be a fair amount of agreement over the back five and the middle three, but the front three….I don’t thinkArsene even knows the answer to that one.
Theo right? I don’t think Theo thinks Theo is right sided player, and anyway, is Arsene freezing him out ahead of january? Ramsey? Not for me. Ox…mmm, maybe.
What about the left? Pod or Gerv?
I think we will need to be at our best next weekend (although we do up our performances against the Big Boys anyway), but the attack needs surgery.
Micky – for Wednesday? I don’t care if we play 3rd team and lose. One competition less to worry about
Micky I think we need a small change in formation of midfield and attack to get the best from our new players.
I also think that we don’t need to name our best 11 in a 4-3-3 but actually our best 11 players and find a formation that gets them all on the pitch.
So for me 3-4-3 probably does it.
GIE,
Although I agree about your thinking and the three at the back, I cannot see AW adopting it. For me, the left side only works with Gibbs as he enables either Pod or Gerv to get on with their jobs.
The right side is a real problem, as I believe there is a major issue with Theo, both in terms of his contract, as well as where he/AW sees his ideal position, and I don’t see a potent alternative.
Evonne,
I do agree with you over wenesday, its just that I’m worried about going to The Toilet next weekend with so little cohesion and understanding amongst our attack.
But Micky the brilliance of 3-4-3 is it allows Gibbs to stay on the pitch (and means that Santos isn’t such a liability of required to play
)
……………….Szczesny…………….
…………………BFG…………………
……..Kozzer…………Vermy…….
Sagna………Arteta………..Gibbs
………………..Jack…………………
……..Cazorla……….Podolski….
……………….Theo…………………
Damn GIE,
I’ve just completed your homework ie name “best 11 players and find a formation that gets them all on the pitch”, and I have:
No goalkeeper and No attack!
Does my startling conclusion finally put to bed the Total Football idiotic theory?
Bloody hell GiE…I DO like that
You should Patent that. 1-2-3-1-2-1
Even that bright spark Herbert Chapman never thought of it
Morning session closed I think.
Have a god day all.
Day of the Lord it may be for some, but I did mean have a GOOD day all
Heard a great quote the other day that might be a good title for today’s match report.
Went something like:
‘Turn a step back into a comeback’
Think that’s exactly what we did last season and hopefully we can do the same again.
Turn a set-back into a comeback.
That sounds more like it!
Morning all
We have a New Post………… and at the right time too

The bug lets someone random who has physical access to your computer change your facetime/iTunes/AppleID password. It doesn't let people you call hack your account.
Seriously. This, incidentally, is why I'm never an early adopter: the extremely high likelihood of a bone-headed oversight in the initial release.

Aye.
Also any mention of how to properly uninstall the beta? I know it's more then just Facetime.app, it seems to add a service daemon for itself to accept calls when the main app isn't running.

It's Apple. Don't worry your pretty little head about it. Just use it and be happy.
Seems almost like that's what this article assumes is the case.
No? Most people don't normally let down their guard in that way? Then perhaps the title of the article should be:
"FaceTime for Mac opens giant Apple ID security hole if the Mac user does something cataclysmically idiotic ". But, that's way too wordy.
Seriously, it is a poor security design to allow this to happen, but I just don't see it being exploited as anything but extremely rare.
Is the password blacked out at least? Is Command-C disabled in the field?
Now that I know it exists, I'll be watching for anyone leaving their Mac unattended... say in Starbucks or someplace... It should only take a few seconds and even if they see me from across the room....

If there is a real exploit or security hole please let us know, in the meantime stop the alarmist rubbish.
I think this article should CLEARLY state that what was 'released' yesterday is a BETA, not the actual released software. I think it's generally understood (at least amongst people savvy enough to be reading Ars) that running beta software has risks associated with it.
...

You should not underestimate the criminal potential and dormant creativity of people.
As opposed to rummaging around your Apple account and buying music on your account.
If my usual trips to local coffeehouses/delis are any indication, yes. A lot.
I expect several things out of beta software:
I expect it to crash.
I expect it to hang.
I expect performance to be poor at odd times.
I expect certain functionality to not work.
I expect downtime.
What I do NOT expect is for beta software to compromise a production account. The second you release software that can compromise a real, existing account, beta or not, you need to re-evaluate your release process and your security auditing.
There's multi-hundred dollar apps on iTunes, local user access means that local programs will also have the ability to alter those settings (especially if it's not access / password controlled), and 'local user' access is pretty easy to obtain. (versus local root, or remote root).
Er.. yeah.
They already have HANDS on hardware to do this, so you are fucked anyways.
If that hadn't happened, I assume that this problem could have been mitigated by going into Keychain Access and adjusting the Access Control settings for FaceTime's Keychain entries -- or by simply deleting those entries.
They already have HANDS on hardware to do this, so you are fucked anyways.
Wrong there, bro. This isn't about hacking your local machine (yes, hands on the hardware in all), it's about hacking your apple account, which is remote, stored on Apple's servers. So yes, if someone has physical access to your computer, it's not secure, but this is about more than that.
Anyway, it's a beta. Everyone knows that security features aren't released until the first service pack. :-)
(Though frankly it feels more like an alpha to me).
Well you got something right.. this is why we have pre-Alphas.. There is absolutely no excuse to have such a gapping security hole in a beta release.
If this were an Enterprise software beta release that my company was testing, we would not be buying it.
(Though frankly it feels more like an alpha to me).
Design issues like this should never make it into code, much less be shipped as a beta.
Yes, because FaceTime stores the password. The attacker can prevent this from happening by logging in via another program (or even his/her own computer) and changing the password a second time...
I assume there are methods to reset the password via email, etc., but that simple change makes it not quite so trivial anymore.
But it is a very widely publicized "come and try this" beta that virtually anyone with a mac who read about yesterday's event would be inclined to try.
And as is so often pointed out, a large percentage of college kids have mac laptops. In the dorms where they live. One of the most insecure environments I ever lived in. And it gives acces to an account hooked to a credit card.
This is a major goof, and there is no defending it.
If there is a real exploit or security hole please let us know, in the meantime stop the alarmist rubbish.
+1 on this comment.
in other words, all your data is accessible to a user of your account if you let them use the account. kinda like every computer, always.
this is not a security hole in the app - it's a realization that all those things that let you login once, keep your password, and auto-apply it for you (ie, every web browser with password-completion), can be used by other people who use your computer. and while i agree in principle that this could be a bit more 'secure', it's not a hole - physical security and unattended use of your stuff is the real issue, and unless apple ships a thuggish goon with your laptop to protected it at all times, it's your own responsibility to keep it physically safe, to password protect access to the account, and a screen-saver which requires authentication to unlock. all features that apple *does* provide.
(Though frankly it feels more like an alpha to me).

He attended a symposium in Stanford in 2001 with geeks from the web world, especially W3C. He was on the RDF W3C working group (via a cunning hack called the HTML writers guild IIRC). All at the grand old age of 14. The following year he visited the UK (for a working group meeting? I forget) where I met him. He was a sweet, smart, nerdy kid. What made him different was probably his confidence in his own views, and his ability to communicate with adult engineers on their level. The internet made that possible to a large degree, since his precocious nature wasn't apparent.

DigiTimes is reporting that Microsoft's much-touted Origami PC almost had Via inside, and not Intel. According to unnamed sources, Microsoft was leaning towards VIA's C7-M for the device, which is about half the price of the Celeron M that eventually made it into the design, before the OEMs nixed the idea. Allegedly, name recognition and R&D muscle were both factors in the decision to go with Intel.
From a technical standpoint, the Intel decision makes sense. The Celeron M's power consumption is competitive with the VIA part, and Intel has plenty of resources to develop and supply supporting logic. Still, the price difference is pretty steep, so if you're looking for a reason why Samsung's recently announced Origami device costs so much then part of the blame has to go to Intel.
For my part, I think Origami, like all tablet PCs, is a solution looking for a problem. The device is too big to fit in a pocket, the battery life is too low, and it's just too general-purpose. It's in this limbo zone between a laptop and a PDA, and we all know how well the later are (not) selling.
To be honest, in the past few years I've only bought one portable computing device that really rocked my world: the Garmin Nuvi 350. The form factor is excellent—it's just an LCD touch-screen, about the size of a deck of cards. It has a well-defined set of functions, along with some very nice add-ons (mounts as a USB drive, can play music in a number of formats, can display pictures, has an SD slot, etc.), and it's extremely easy to use. Microsoft should take a page from Garmin's book and start producing product guidelines and customized software for an array of smaller, simpler, cheaper, more specialized "lifestyle" devices.
Whether the industry likes it or not, we still live in a world where portable devices need to do one or two things really well (three at most), and they need to do them in manner that's intuitive. They also need to be small, and to have good battery life. A device that's a little bit too big, doesn't hold enough juice, and tries to do absolutely everything, is destined for the discount bin at Fry's.

Very few milestones can top a wedding. One of them is getting married while trying to finish a full marathon.
In April 2009, Rachel Pitt and her fiancé Garry Keates earned the distinction of being the first couple to get married during that year's London Marathon. In 2011, Andrew Ford and his fiancee Katrina Scaife followed suit, taking a detour after running 20 miles just to get married. In 1999, Mick Gambrill and Barbara Cole took a break from the marathon after running two miles just to tie the knot.
While the long-distance running event has attracted a variety of runners - from experienced ones to novices to runners donning wacky costumes - many couples are enticed to enter the world's largest marathon, so that they can have a unique and truly memorable wedding day. But, as both running a marathon and getting married entail adequate investment of time, money and effort, getting married during a marathon offers some unique logistical issues that couples must address.
Professional wedding photography expert David Jones advises couples who wish to get hitched, whether in a traditional manner or during a race, to have a reasonable timeline to prepare for their big day. This gives them much leeway to prepare for any unforeseen events that may crop up during preparations for the ceremony. As the couples can trade their wedding dresses and tuxedos for sportier garb and their high heels and formal shoes for running shoes, they still have to consider other important things like whether to finish the event first or get married while running the race as Mary Martin and Raymond Donaldson did when they got married during the New York City marathon. Also, they should also consider finding a wedding celebrant, booking a post-race wedding reception venue, and getting the services of a London-based photographer.

Abstract
Introduction
Chemokine receptors play an important role in mediating the recruitment of T cells to inflammatory sites. Previously, small proportions of circulating Th1-type CCR5+ and Th2-type CCR3+ cells have been shown in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Wondering to what extent CCR4 and CCR6 expression could also be implicated in T cell recruitment.
Introduction
T cells display considerable heterogeneity in terms of phenotype, function, and anatomical distribution. Whereas naïve T cells represent a relatively homogenous population, primed T cells acquire effector functions and differentiate into distinct effector and memory subsets. Whereas naïve and central memory T cells home to secondary lymphoid organs to mount antigen-driven proliferative responses, effector memory T cells migrate into peripheral tissues to display immediate effector functions such as cytokine production or cytotoxicity or both [1,2]. The process of T cell recruitment from blood into tissue is controlled by adhesion molecules, in which chemokine receptors have an important role [2].
Previously, we showed that a small proportion of circulating memory T cells displays T-helper cell 1 (Th1)-type CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 5 and Th2-type CCR3 expression in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) [3]. GPA is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology and is characterized by necrotizing granulomatosis of the upper or lower respiratory tract or both and a systemic autoimmune vasculitis preferentially affecting pulmonary and renal small vessels. The vasculitis is associated with highly specific anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) [4]. T cells are abundant in inflammatory lesions in GPA. CCR5, CCR3, and their chemokine ligand CCL5 (regulated upon activation in normal T cells, expressed and secreted, or RANTES) are expressed in granulomatous lesions of the respiratory tract. These studies suggested that CCR5 and CCR3 could be involved in the recruitment of interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-producing and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-producing Th1- and interleukin (IL)-4-producing Th2-type cells to inflammatory sites in GPA [5-7]. More recently, IL-17-producing PR3-specific Th17 cells have been implicated in the maintenance of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity in GPA [8-10]. CCR4+ T cells have been reported to secrete IL-4, whereas CCR6+ cells produce IL-17 [11,12]. To investigate the extent to which the chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR6 could be implicated in T-cell recruitment in GPA, we analyzed CCR4 and CCR6 expression on circulating T cells, assigned CCR4- and CCR6-expressing cells to the respective memory cell subsets, and determined the cytokine production of CCR4+ and CCR6+ T cells.
Materials and methods
Study population
Patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria and the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definition for GPA, respectively [13,14]. Disease activity was recorded in accordance with European League Against Rheumatism recommendations (Table 1) [15]. All patients and controls provided informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (#07-059).
Antibodies used for flow cytometry
The following antibodies were used in different combinations: Pacific blue (PB)-conjugated anti-CD3, PB- or phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD4, peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)- or allophycocyanine-cyanine dye 7 (APC-Cy7)-conjugated anti-CD8, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD45RA, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CCR7, PE-Cy7- and PE-conjugated anti-CCR4, PE-conjugated anti-CCR6, APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-IFNγ, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-IL-4, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-IL-17a from eBioscience (Frankfurt, Germany) and APC-conjugated anti-IL-22 from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Appropriate isotype controls were included in the experimental setup. All antibodies (unless indicated otherwise) were purchased from BD Biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany).
Surface marker and intracellular cytokine staining
Flow cytometry was performed to characterize T cell populations at the single-cell level. Staining of cellular surface markers was performed by using freshly collected whole blood (Li-heparin) as described earlier [3]. Briefly, previously determined optimal concentrations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for cell surface antigens were added to 100 μL of whole blood and incubated 45 minutes in the dark at 4°C. Subsequently, erythrocytes were lysed by the addition of FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) Lysing Solution (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). After incubation for another 10 minutes in the dark at room temperature, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline/0.01% bovine serum albumin and immediately analyzed by FACS.
For intracellular cytokine staining, freshly collected whole blood was stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma, Munich, Germany) (10 ng/mL) and ionomycin (Sigma) (1 μg/mL) for 4 hours at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Brefeldin (Sigma) (10 μg/mL) was added at the beginning of the stimulation to inhibit cytokine secretion. After staining for surface antigens and lysing of erythrocytes with FACS Lysing Solution, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer (BD Pharmingen). Staining of intracytoplasmatic cytokines was performed at 4°C for 45 minutes in the dark with previously determined optimal concentrations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for cytokines or appropriate negative (isotype) controls. Besides appropriate isotype controls, an unstimulated sample was included for each patient and control as a negative control.
Flow cytometric analysis
Multicolor flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACS Canto II cytometer by using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Lymphocytes were gated for analysis on the basis of light scattering properties and of CD3, CD4, and CD8 staining. Positively and negatively stained populations were calculated by quadrant dot plot analysis determined by isotype controls.
Statistical analysis
Statistics were performed by using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Comparisons between patients and control subjects were done by employing the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. P values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Increased frequency of CCR4- and CCR6-expressing CD4+ T cells in granulomatosis with polyangiitis
To assess CCRs relevant for migration to peripheral tissues, we determined the expression of the CCR4 and CCR6 on peripheral blood T cells in patients with GPA and healthy controls. We found a significant increase in the percentages of CCR4- and CCR6-expressing cells within the total CD4+ T cell population in patients with GPA compared with healthy individuals (Figure 1a, b). Apart from the CCR4+CCR6- and CCR4-CCR6+ 'single positive' subsets, a smaller fraction of CCR4+CCR6+ 'double positive' cells was detected within the CD4+ T cell population in patients with GPA and healthy controls (17.5% ± 4.8% versus 10.3% ± 0.6%, mean ± standard error of the mean, no significant difference, Mann-Whitney U test). Conversely, the remainder of cells within the CD4+ T-cell population were CCR4-CCR6- 'double negative' cells. In contrast, there was no difference in the percentages of CD8+CCR4+ and CD8+CCR6+ T cells between patients with GPA and healthy controls (data not shown).

CCR4 and CCR6 are expressed on distinct memory cell populations, including CCR7+CD45RAmed very early memory cells
Having shown a significant increase in the frequencies of CCR4- and CCR6-expressing CD4+ T cells in patients with GPA, we were interested in phenotypic features of CCR4- and CCR6-expressing CD4+ T cells next. To assign CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells to the respective naïve and memory cell subsets, cells were additionally stained with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies for CD45RA and CCR7 to allow discrimination into diverse T cell subsets [2,16-18]. By the use of these markers, we found that CCR4 and CCR6 expression was confined largely to the circulating CCR7+CD45RA- central memory (TCM) and CCR7-CD45RA- (TEM) and CCR7-CD45RA+ (TEMRA) effector memory cell subsets within the total CD4+ T cell population. A significant increase in the frequency of CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells was remarkable in the CCR7-CD45RA+ effector memory (TEMRA) subset in patients with GPA. A significant increase in CCR6+ cells was also found in the CCR7+CD45RA- central memory T-cell subset (TCM). However, significantly increased percentages of CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells were also detected in the CCR7+CD45RA+ population, which contains naïve T cells (TN) by definition (Figure 2a, b). Dissecting the CCR7+CD45RA+ population with respect to CD45RA fluorescence intensity, we detected two subsets in the CCR7+CD45RA+ population. CCR7+CD45RAhigh T cells generally lacked CCR4 and CCR6 expression with the exception of three patients with GPA. In contrast, CCR7+CD45RAmed T cells displayed CCR4 and CCR6 expression. We found higher frequencies of CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells within the CCR7+CD45RAmed T cell subset in patients with GPA compared with healthy controls (Figure 2c, d). Thus, the CCR7+CD45RA+ population contained genuine CCR7+CD45RAhigh TN lacking CCR4 and CCR6 expression and another CCR7+CD45RAmed T cell subset comprising CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells. The latter was reminiscent of so-called very early memory T cells (TVEM) [19].

Decreased frequency of CCR7+CD45RAhigh naïve T cells and unreduced frequency of CCR7+CD45RAmed very early memory T cells in granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Earlier studies have reported significantly lower percentages of peripheral blood TN by using CCR7 and CD45RO or CD45RB expression for the phenotypic characterization of T cells in patients with GPA [20,21]. In this study, we showed a segregation of the CCR7+CD45RA+ T cell compartment into different two subsets based on CCR4 and CCR6 expression and CD45RA fluorescence intensity. This prompted us to investigate whether TN and TVEM frequencies were likewise decreased within the total CD4+ T-cell population. In line with the aforementioned earlier studies, we found a significantly lower percentage of CCR7+CD45RAhigh TN in patients with GPA compared with healthy controls [20,21]. In contrast, CCR7+CD45RAmed TVEM frequencies were similar in patients with GPA and healthy individuals (Figure 3).

Distinct cytokine-producing subsets within CCR4+ and CCR6+ T-cell populations
We showed increased frequencies of circulating CCR4- or CCR6-expressing (or both) CD4+ TCM, TEMRA, and TVEM in patients with GPA. To investigate functional features of CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells within the total CD4+ T cell population, peripheral blood cells were stained for intracellular cytokines. An IFNγ+ cell fraction was found in all CCR4+ or CCR6+ subsets or both. An increased percentage of IL-17+ and IL-22+ cells was detected in the CCR4-CCR6+ 'single positive' and CCR4+CCR6+ 'double positive' cell fractions when compared with the CCR4-CCR6- 'double negative' cell subset. Furthermore, an increased frequency of IL-4+ cells was shown in the CCR4+CCR6- 'single positive' cell fraction compared with the CCR4-CCR6- 'double negative' cell subset in both patients with GPA and healthy controls. CCR4-CCR6+ 'single positive' and CCR4+CCR6+ 'double positive' cells differed from each other with respect to the percentage of IFNγ-producing cells, which was significantly higher in the CCR4-CCR6+ 'single positive' fraction (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). The CCR4-CCR6- 'double negative' cell subset differed from the other subsets in that only an IFNγ+ cell fraction was remarkable in this subset (Table 2). Less than 1% of cells displayed intracellular co-expression of IL-17 and IL-22 in CCR6+ cells within the total CD4+ T-cell population (data not shown). Thus, circulating CD4+CCR4+ and CD4+CCR6+ T cell populations comprised distinct subsets of cytokine-producing cells.
Discussion
Chemokine receptors play an important role in mediating T cell recruitment to distinct anatomical sites and tissues [2]. Whereas the CC chemokine receptor CCR7 mediates homing of naïve (TN) and central memory (TCM) T cells to lymph nodes, other CC and CXC chemokine receptors (CCR/CXCR) trigger intravascular adhesion and direct migration of effector memory T cell subsets (CD45RA- TEM and CD45RA+ 'reverted' TEMRA) into peripheral tissues for patrol and recruitment to inflammatory sites [2,19]. Previously, cloned CCR6+ cells from peripheral blood and inflammatory sites in Crohn's disease have been shown to produce IL-17. In contrast, CCR4+ cells secrete IL-4 [11,12,22]. Recently, Th17-, Th22-, and Th2-type PR3-specific cells have been suggested to be involved in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity in GPA [8-10,23]. Moreover, an increased proportion of circulating CD45RClow Th2-type and Th17 cells has been reported in ANCA-associated vasculitides, including GPA. The increase is independent of disease duration and treatment [24]. Therefore, to investigate the extent to which CCR4 and CCR6 expression could be implicated in T-cell recruitment in GPA, we analyzed the expression of these chemokine receptors on T cells.
In this study, we found increased frequencies of circulating CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells within the total CD4+ T cell population in GPA. In contrast, we found no significant increase in the frequencies of CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells in the total CD8+ T cell population. CCR4 and CCR6 expression suggests T cell activation [11,12]. Persistent T cell activation regardless of clinical disease activity has been reported in GPA [20,21,25]. Recently, stable CCR6 expression was reported to be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms [26]. In line with previous reports, CCR4 and CCR6 expression was confined largely to circulating CCR7+CD45RA- central memory (TCM), CCR7-CD45RA- (TEM), and CCR7-CD45RA+ (TEMRA) effector memory CD4+ T cells [11,12]. We found a significant increase in the frequency of CCR4+ and CCR6+ TEMRA and CCR6+ TCM in patients with GPA. Surprisingly, CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells were also detected within the CCR7+CD45RA+ population, which contains the naïve T cell subset (TN) by definition. TN are CD45RA+ and express CCR7 for peripheral lymph node homing but lack receptors such as CCR4 and CCR6 for the migration to peripheral tissues [2,16-18]. Further analysis dissecting the CCR7+CD45RA+ population with regard to CD45RA fluorescence intensity disclosed that the CCR7+CD45RA+ T-cell compartment contained two subsets. One subset of CCR7+CD45RAhigh T cells generally lacked CCR4 and CCR6 expression with the exception of three patients with GPA. Thus, CCR7+CD45RAhigh T cells represented genuine TN. CCR4 and CCR6 expression on CCR7+CD45RAhigh TN in individual patients with GPA could represent TN activation, which has been reported before by demonstrating an increased frequency of CD4+CD45RO-FoxP3- TN expressing the activation marker CD25 [20,25]. In line with earlier studies, we showed that the percentage of CCR7+CD45RAhigh TN within the total CD4+ T cell population was significantly lower in patients with GPA [20,21]. In contrast, the percentage of CCR7+CD45RAmed T cells was not decreased in patients with GPA. CCR7+CD45RAmed T cells displayed CCR4 and CCR6 expression reminiscent of so-called very early memory T cells (TVEM). Higher frequencies of CCR4+ and CCR6+ cells within the CCR7+CD45RAmed TVEM subset were found in patients with GPA compared with healthy controls. TVEM have been described earlier as 'apparently TN' oddly displaying chemokine receptors for both lymph node homing (CCR7) and peripheral tissue migration (CCR4 and CXCR3) in healthy individuals by Song and colleagues [19]. Analysis of the proliferation history, T-cell receptor repertoire, and cytokine response of CCR4- and CXCR3-expressing CCR7+CD45RO- T cells suggests that these cells represent TVEM, which have proceeded only a short way along the differentiation pathway from TN to TCM or TEM. TVEM are still multifunctional but finally differentiate into either TCM or TEM [19].
Earlier studies showed that chemokine receptor expression for lymph node homing (CCR7) and peripheral tissue migration (for example, CCR4) is not mutually exclusive on T cell subsets [27]. The migratory behavior of TEM displaying dual-chemokine receptor expression is determined by chemotactic gradients and cytokine- and T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signals [28]. CCR4-expressing CCR7+ TEM have been reported in inflamed peripheral tissues (for example, in psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) [29,30]. Whereas CCR7- TEM remain in the peripheral tissue, CCR7+ TEM migrate to peripheral tissues and subsequently exit the tissue to enter draining lymph nodes in different animal models [31,32]. Although CCR7+ TEM retain a capability to enter lymph nodes, inflammatory cytokines can subvert migration of CCR7+ TEM, resulting in the retention of CCR7+ TEM in the inflamed synovial tissue [33]. Cytokines also drive the differentiation of CCR4-expressing CCR7+ TCM to CCR7- TEM [22]. Of note, CCR7+ TEM accumulate in areas of ectopic lymphoid tissue in the inflamed synovial tissue [30]. In contrast, CCR4-expressing CCR7+ TVEM reside or recirculate in secondary lymphoid tissues, where they continue to differentiate and acquire further chemokine receptors for peripheral tissue migration [19].
Having shown increased frequencies of circulating CCR4- and CCR6-expressing CD4+ memory T cell subsets, including TVEM in patients with GPA, we analyzed the cytokine production of CCR4+ and CCR6+ T cells. Previously, cloned and, as such, preselected CCR6+ cells were reported to secrete IL-17, whereas CCR4+ T cells produce IL-4 [11,12]. In our study, we found an increased percentage of IL-17- and IL-22-producing cells in the CCR4-CCR6+ 'single positive' and CCR4+CCR6+ 'double positive' cell subsets and an increased frequency of IL-4+ cells in the CRR4+CCR6- 'single positive' cell subset compared with the CCR4-CCR6- 'double negative' cell subset within the total circulating CD4+ T-cell population. Thus, in line with earlier studies, we found Th17 cells within circulating CCR6+ cells and Th2-type cells among CCR4+ cells [11,12]. Moreover, CCR4-CCR6+ 'single positive' and CCR4+CCR6+ 'double positive' cells differed from each other with respect to the percentage of IFNγ-producing cells, which was higher in the former cell population.
Conclusions
We found increased frequencies of circulating CCR4+ and CCR6+ T cells in patients with GPA. CCR4 and CCR6 expression was confined largely to central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM and TEMRA) subsets but could also be detected on very early memory T cells (TVEM) displaying chemokine receptors for both lymph node homing (CCR7) and peripheral tissue migration (CCR4 and CCR6). CD4+CCR4+ and CD4+CCR6+ T-cell populations contained distinct cytokine-producing subsets. Our data suggest that CCR4 and CCR6 could be involved in the recruitment of different T cell subsets, including cytokine-producing cells, to inflamed sites in patients with GPA. Further studies are needed to assess CCR4+ and CCR6+ T cell reactivity to the respective chemokine gradients and the expression of CCR4, CCR6, and their chemokine ligands in inflammatory lesions in patients with GPA in order to define new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Youngsters especially teenagers these days are much more concerned about how they look. Acne is a problem they usually have to deal with as it can cause great stress and embarrassment at times. It is somewhat that does not discriminate between caste, creed and color. This problem thus needs to be treated in a much bolder way. For treating it permanently we really need to reach up to its root cause. A healthy diet with right kind of nutrition content will surely help you in suppressing acne permanently.
Nutrients you Need stop Acne Breakouts
1. Vitamin A- Dietary intake of vitamin A is imperative for those who are suffering from any kind of skin problems, especially acne. Some rich sources of Vitamin A that you should consume in your daily diet include dairy products, Fish oils, mango, carrots and vegetables. Include Vitamin A rich products in your every day meal and see considerable effects within a month time.
2. Fiber- Acne may also occur because of the toxins present inside our body. These toxins do not only result in body acne, but could also cause other health issues as well. Thus, detoxification is very necessary. Fibrous foods generally act as detoxifying agent and helps in cleaning our skin tissues against harmful toxins. Eat food like whole grains, oatmeal, pastas and flax seeds for improving the state of your skin.
3. Vitamin C- Vitamin C is an important nutrient known for building our immune system and healing wounds. Acne breakouts are the signs of poor immune system. Intake of vitamin C can help you cure acne related problems. Eat fruits and lots of vegetable that are rich in Vitamin C. Oranges, broccoli, cantaloupes and lemon juice are considered as the richest sources of vitamin C. It helps in stimulating collagen hence preventing our skin from premature aging and removing acne scars.
4. Vitamin E- Vitamin E is another nutrient that protects our skin from aging and brings glow to it. Oxidative stress is one of the major reasons for several acne problems. Papaya, Almonds, mustard greens, chard, sunflower seeds, spinach and Turnip greens are the excellent sources of vitamin E. Instead one can also consume vitamin E supplements.
Instead of applying ointments and consuming lots of supplements the best treatment for acne is to have diet rich in all essential nutrients. Deficiency of any of these could exaggerate the problem further. Despite of having nutrient rich dietary intake increase your daily water intake as it will help you in flushing out toxins from the body making your skin look youthful and radiant.

Greene had to appreciate the early-inning lead. He had given up seven runs in 2 1/3 innings on the way to his first loss of the year at Veterans Stadium in Game 2. This time, he took advantage of a big defensive play in the second inning and carried a shutout into the fifth.
The Braves might have pushed him into a hole after he walked Fred McGriff to lead off the second. David Justice followed with a rocket toward right-center field that was speared by a leaping Morandini.

Activity at the nation's factories increased for a 20th consecutive month in January, but the pace of expansion eased, reflecting sustained, moderate growth in the overall economy.
The Institute for Supply Management said yesterday that its index measuring manufacturing activity declined to 56.4 in January, just below the reading of 57 expected by analysts. That was a drop from a revised reading of 57.3 in December, but any measure above 50 indicates expansion.

Independence Day gives us a renewed opportunity to reflect on the accomplishments of our nation's founders, the triumphs of generations of brave men and women in uniform and appreciate the freedoms that we enjoy as Americans - freedoms we often take for granted. At a time when many Americans gather at barbeques, parades and fireworks displays, the price of gasoline this year could prevent some families and friends from celebrating together. Today in Central Kentucky, some families are choosing between buying groceries and getting to work in the morning. As gas prices soar to over $4 per gallon, I know that Kentuckians need relief now.
Gas prices are high for a number of reasons. Decades of failed policies and the increase in demand from new world powers such as India and China are now catching up to Americans.
As you may know, the weakening dollar has helped make the price of a barrel of oil skyrocket, while price speculation by major investors further artificially drives up the price. With new international markets, price speculation and the weakening dollar, supply and demand are not as simple as they used to be.

Q. I have been experiencing yeast infections at least once every month. I also have vaginal bacterial infections but not one of the sexually transmitted diseases. For months I've taken cleocin for the bacteria, Flagyl for the yeast and have switched my oral birth control pills, but to no avail. This last visit my doctor prescribed a higher dose of Flagyl and said for my husband to take some, too. And if it comes back to go see her again. What can I do?
A. Sorry that you are having such a frustrating experience. But you may have hit upon the right approach. Yeast infections are common and seem to be increased in women who are taking birth-control pills. If this is a problem that started not long after you began taking the pills, finding another form of birth control may help.

Many of the programmers, engineers and developers we talk to have a secret that they don't reveal until they know people pretty well. No, I'm not talking about the complete set of Star Wars playing cards they have stashed in the basement or the Rush LPs they haven't gotten around to trading in yet. I'm talking about Legos.
You remember Legos, those infinitely malleable blocks that children around the world use to construct everything from tiny towers to life-size towers. Perhaps because these toys leave so much to the imagination, they've captured the imagination of a generation of tech workers. The appearance of Lego in Douglas Copeland's novel Microserfs, set on the Microsoft corporate campus, is one example of how pervasive it is.

Federal thrift regulators on Monday rejected the $3-billion sale of Columbia Savings & Loan's junk bond portfolio to a Canadian-led partnership, all but guaranteeing the thrift will be seized by regulators.
In their unprecedented action, regulators with the Office of Thrift Supervision said the deal as currently structured carried undue risks for Columbia and taxpayers, and could violate last year's thrift bailout law. They asked the Beverly Hills thrift to seek new bids, and OTS Director Timothy Ryan said in a statement that he hopes additional bids "will result in a proposal that we can quickly approve."

GEORGETOWN, Ky. - Individually, the players of the 1972 U.S. Olympic men's basketball team have long moved on, but as a unit they are among the most interesting in amateur or professional sports history. They were not only the first U.S. men's basketball team to lose a game after the Americans had gone 63-0 in the Olympics, but they also left Munich without their silver medals around their necks.
For the first time since that controversial, 51-50 loss to Russia in the '72 championship game, all 12 players are together.
This weekend they are having a reunion, and they remain united in one simple fact - the players still have no interest in picking up the medals.

The Prince William Board of County Supervisors is expected to vote Tuesday to eliminate the county’s internal auditor department and outsource the work to a contractor, a move that critics charge would deprive the county of an internal, independent watchdog.
In a strongly worded memo, the county’s auditing department said the plan would undercut the county’s credibility and bring in outsiders who are not familiar with the complicated workings of the government, which has an operating budget of $914 million.
“The public should be able to have confidence that there is a genuinely independent internal audit function,” read the memo, which was obtained by The Washington Post.
If the job is outsourced, “taxpayers will never be able to count on learning the truth about what may be going wrong in the county.” The memo also said the plan “would give taxpayers the impression of a county’s desire to not shed light on potentially embarrassing audit findings that could also look bad to regulators or rating agencies.”

Turkey is a modern, secular democracy occupying an ancient, complicated land. At the crossroads of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, the region has been traversed, conquered and fought over by many diverse groups. Today, it is still an incredibly popular place – not for conquest, but for travel. People come to this country of 69 million (approximately 10-20 percent of whom are ethnic Kurds) to marvel at some of the richest archeological sites in the world, including impressive Greek amphitheaters, Roman temples, Byzantine churches, and castles built by Seljuks and Crusaders. They also come for the natural wonders – the golden beaches, turquoise (the word comes from "Turk") waters and spectacular coastline of the Aegean and Mediterranean; the honeycombed stone towers of Cappadocia; the white mineral pools of Pamukkale; the mountains of Eastern Anatolia and the green hills of the Black Sea coast. Istanbul is a major destination in its own right, a unique combination of East and West, ancient and modern. It has been the capital of three empires (Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman). In addition to all of these compelling places, Turkey has amazing food, friendly people, beautiful handicrafts and sprawling bazaars – it's easy to understand why the country never fails to leave visitors wanting more.
Travel in Turkey
Visitors to Turkey journey through time and fall under the spell of a kaleidoscope of sights and traditions. Our travelers retrace the glories of ancient civilizations (Hittite, Greek, Roman, Selcuk), learn about the old Turkic tribes wandering the steppes of Central Asia, and marvel at the achievements of the Ottoman Empire. Visitors also experience the often surprising modernity of Turkish cities where a complex mosaic of layered cultures and civilizations are merged, symbolically represented by the tile-covered mosques next to ancient churches, synagogues and the remains of Roman temples. Landscapes also differ incredibly: Huge rivers flow through the immense plains of Anatolia; the Black Sea is the largest oxygen-free marine system; and massive mountains meet olive, fig and pistachio groves on the rugged Mediterranean coast. This hugely diverse country offers vast history and artistic treasures, grandiose vistas, and traditional ways of life quietly coexisting with modern ones. There is much more to Turkey than history and architecture, however, and Artisans of Leisure's travelers experience it all: cosmopolitan Istanbul, shopping for wonderful local goods such as kilim rugs and beautiful glassware, relaxing at upscale seaside resorts, sailing on the sea, and enjoying Turkey's incredible cuisine.
Turkish cuisine, one of the world's greatest, is definitely one of the highlights of any trip. The country's varied geography provides an abundance of produce – tomatoes, eggplants, zucchini, olives, figs, grapes – as well as meats and fish. The main staples are skewered and roasted meats, and the cuisine emphasizes freshness of ingredients and simple cooking techniques. Classic recipes deeply influenced by Ottoman imperial cuisine incorporate seasonings like dill, mint, sweet spices and yogurt, which is also a common side condiment. Breakfast typically consists of fresh tomatoes, white cheese, black olives, preserves and freshly baked bread. Meals commonly start with mezeler, or appetizers, such as roasted eggplant, salads, manti (tiny stuffed pasta), pickles, stuffed fish, pilaf rice in grape leaves, and kofte (lamb meatballs). Also, fragrant breads and freshly baked pide (Turkish pizza) are well worth trying. Desserts are often stuffed with dried nuts and flavored with rose water and saffron. Sweets are served with Turkish coffee – the country is credited with the spread of the beverage in Europe. Turkish tea, often apple-flavored, is served in small tulip-shaped glasses, and drunk throughout the day. Light beers, wines and the anisette flavored raki ("lion's milk") are common alcoholic drinks.
Turkey is also a wonderful shopping destination. Contemporary and ancient designs are combined with traditional techniques to create beautiful products. Stroll through the bustling bazaars, arastas (shop-lined streets) and bedestens (covered markets) of Istanbul, Bursa, Izmir, Ankara, Cappadocia, Konya and the towns along the Mediterranean. Shop for handmade jewelry, textiles, copper and brass-ware, leather goods, intricate silk carpets and colorful kilims (flat-woven rugs). Turkish ceramics and Iznik tiles (as seen decorating mosques and traditional Turkish baths). Ceramics and glassware are often modeled on 17th and 18th century original designs. Avanos, a town in Cappadocia, is well known for a strong tradition in pottery, produced since antiquity using the clay from the nearby Red River (Kizilirmac). Collectors can shop for quality antiques, including Oriental rugs and more rustic Turkish kilim, while gourmets will find wonderful spices (saffron is still hand-harvested) and beautiful housewares.
RECOMMENDED LUXURY TOURS TO TURKEY
Our recommended luxury tours of Turkey include cosmopolitan destinations such Istanbul and Izmir, the underground cities and rock formations of Cappadocia, the mineral pools of Pamukkale, the ruins of Aspendos, Ephesus, and Pergamon along the Mediterranean, and luxury beach resorts in Bodrum and Antalya. Our itineraries include the highlights of the country, but we are happy to customize more off the beaten track tours elsewhere in Turkey to suit individual travel interests.
Tours in Istanbul
When in Istanbul, we like visiting the highlights and the more off the beaten path attractions. Built on seven hills and divided into the Old City, the New (European) City and Asian Side, Istanbul’s districts are separated by the waters of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn and connected by bridges and ferries. In Sultanahmet, Istanbul's oldest district, visit mosques and palaces, museums and minarets. Explore the Blue Mosque and nearby Turkish and Islamic Art Museum, the imposing Aya Sofya, the Underground Cistern (Yerebatan Saray) and the Hippodrome (anciently the political heart of the city), the jewels and beautiful tile-covered harem at Topkapi Palace (sultans' palace), the bustling Grand Baazar and the Egyptian (Spice) Market. Also visit lively Taksim, the heart of the modern city, and Beyoglu, where "old Istanbul" meets the modern and secular city. Formerly a posh district of European embassies and boutiques along the famed Grand Rue de Pera (today's Istiklal Caddesi), it is again a center of cultural activities amid restored covered passageways, coffeehouses and stores. The Western districts offer traditional Islamic, Christian and Jewish heritage. Visit the Church of St. Saviour in Chora (also known as Kariye Mosque or Museum) whose splendor matches Aya Sofya. Stroll around quaint Phanar (Fener), a traditional Greek district and site of the Christian Orthodox Church, and Cukurcuma, known for small antique shops and second-hand bookstores. Cukurcuma is also a centre of avant-garde culture. Leave the city center and relax at Emirgan, famous for seaside cafes, the large park and Ottoman pavilions, and Tarabya, an old settlement around a beautiful bay. Explore the quaint Princes Islands and perhaps bike around beautiful houses and landscaped gardens while enjoying wonderful views. Upon request, a private yacht charter on the Bosphorus can be arranged.
Interesting day trips from Istanbul include Bursa, the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, across the Marmara Sea from Istanbul. Explore its tiled architecture and wooden houses, covered bazaars and antique shops, pleasant gardens, silk (silk-cocoon markets are in June and September) and textile markets, and excellent restaurants. Also visit nearby Iznik (anciently Nicaea) to shop renowned ceramics. A full-day excursion to Troy is also possible.
Our preferred luxury hotels in Istanbul are the Four Seasons
Hotel at Sultanahmet
(located in the historic district), the exclusive Four Seasons Hotel at the Bosphorus, the Park Hyatt Istanbul, and the Ciragan Palace Hotel, a legendary property overlooking the Bosphorus.
Tours in Cappadocia
Cappadocia, with traditional villages and communities scattered around a unique landscape of "fairy chimneys," is one of the highlights of any trip to Turkey. Eroded rock formations, ancient underground cities and fresco-covered churches in caves make up this region’s otherworldly topography. Visit Urgup and Goreme, where homes, churches, stores, hotels and restaurants create a fascinating and slightly surreal moonscape. Many of these structures are literally carved from conical mounds or caves. Explore Derinkuyu's Underground City for the largest remains of troglodyte living in the area (the lowest accessible level at a depth of 180 ft) and Kaymakli Underground City for its impressively well developed public spaces (tunnels, galleries, chapels, wells). Cappadocia also offers interesting shopping. In Urgup, Ortahisar and Goreme there are impressive rugs (often natural dyes – black, brown and ivory) covered with simple patterns, while the region surrounding Avanos is well known for pottery and ceramics. One of the most exciting ways to see Cappadocia is from a hot air balloon and, in the summertime, private excursions can be arranged. For those particularly enchanted by the fairy chimneys, Artisans of Leisure can arrange for a private meal by candlelight in one of the area’s many caves.
In Cappadocia we recommend traditional-style "cave hotels" such as Cappadocia Cave Resort and Spa.
Tours in Ankara
Ankara, deep in the heart of Anatolia's plain, is Turkey's capital as well as its political, administrative and cultural center. Beside opera, music and performing arts venues-catering mostly to foreign diplomats and Turkish politicians-it also has several prestigious universities. Although often overlooked by travelers, we recommend spending at least a few hours, on the way to or from Cappadocia, to visit the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations with its amazing archaeological collections inside a 15th century caravanserai; the important Ataturk Mausoleum, the colorful Old Town, and the Roman ruins of Angora. Ankara also has some interesting shopping opportunities, including unique rugs, ceramics, jewelry, and Angora wool accessories.
Tours in Konya
Ancient Konya, between Cappadocia and Antalya, is the center of the fascinating Sufi cult of the whirling dervishes. Visit the very interesting Mevlana Museum and Tomb of Mevlana Celaleddin and explore rug and antique stores.
Tours on the Mediterranean Coast
Around the resort towns of Side and Antalya are some of Turkey's best preserved Roman ruins. Side, Aspendos and Perge are especially famous for their amphitheaters, and the hilltop ruins of Termessos offer outstanding views of the surrounding mountains and Mediterranean Sea beyond. Along the rugged coast of pine forests are small towns and villages with charming marinas, outdoor cafes, and quaint shops with antiques, copper goods, rugs and ceramics. Walk cobblestone streets in Kas and Kalkan, amid whitewashed houses and colorful geraniums. Learn about Santa Claus and sail to sunken cities around Kale. Admire Lycian tombs carved on the side of the mountain around Fethiye. Marmaris, stretching along the oceanfront, has an attractive marina and a big covered bazaar. Shopping options include jewelry, rug, ceramic, and leather artifacts.
Our recommended hotels in Antalya are the Mardan Palace Hotel, the Kempinski Dome Hotel or the Sheraton Voyager Antalya.
Tours in the Aegean Coast
The region stretching from Bodrum to Canakkale offers upscale resort towns. Bodrum has a beautiful yacht harbor and marina, ancient ruins, whitewashed residential villages, fine restaurants, and seaside markets. Cesme is a charming resort town offering good shopping for jewelry, rugs, and leather clothes. Izmir, the old fabled Smyrna, is a modern city of leafy boulevards and good shopping (jewelry and leather goods) in its large bazaar and upscale promenade. Kusadasi, a lively port town, makes a wonderful homebase from which to visit the splendid ruins of Ephesus and Pergamon.
Our recommended hotels on the Aegean Coast include the Swisshotel Izmir and the Aman Resort in Bodrum.
Artisans of Leisure uses the best local guides throughout Turkey. Our itineraries create a true luxury experience, combining Turkish cuisine, beautiful art and design, and great shopping and cultural sightseeing. Whether you are interested in Turkey's history and ruins, Jewish tours of Turkey, Biblical Turkey, or visits to Turkey's more remote cultures and landscapes, our private Turkey tours are entirely tailored to your interests.

The notorious Russian Business Network has been identified as the ISP
responsible for a recent information-stealing financial attack
Security firm Sunbelt, which recently discovered that the Bank of
India's hacked website was serving dangerous malware, has said the
infamous Russian Business Network an ISP linked to child pornography and
phishing is behind the attack.
The service provider in question has developed a notorious reputation,
with VeriSign classifying it as "the baddest of the bad" in the ISP
world in June 2006.
According to VeriSign threat intelligence analyst Kimberly Zenz, the
Russian Business Network (RBN) is different to other service providers
because "unlike many ISPs that host predominately legitimate items, RBN
is entirely illegal".
"A scan of RBN and affiliated ISPs' net space conducted by VeriSign
iDefense analysts failed to locate any legitimate activity. Instead,
[our] research identified phishing, malicious code, botnet
command-and-control, denial-of-service attacks and child pornography on
every single server owned and operated by RBN," Zenz wrote in a recent
Zenz added that RBN almost exclusively attacks non-Russian financial
institutions and its leaders' family ties with a "a powerful St
Petersburg politician" effectively offer it immunity from prosecution.
Patrik Runald, senior security specialist at F-Secure, said: "No one
knows who the RBN is. They are a secret group based out of St Petersburg
that appears to have political connections. The company doesn't
legitimately exist. It's not registered and provides hosting for
everything that's bad."
"Their network infrastructure is behind a lot of the bad stuff we're
seeing and it has connections to the MPack Group [a well-known group of
cybercriminals which used MPack software to steal confidential data],"
said Runald.
Runald said that, in the case of the Bank of India's hacked website, RBN
used an Iframe to launch another window which then pushed victims to a
webpage containing malicious code.
"That page contained links to three other pages on other servers," said
Runald. "At the time we started looking into it, two out of three URLs
had been taken down. The one remaining was trying to use an exploit from
2006 to affect systems with a Trojan downloader. Once infected, that
downloader would go out and download another piece of malware, including
other downloaders," said Runald.
The Trojans used in this case were designed to steal passwords from PCs
and upload Trojan proxies in aide of developing a botnet.

The Monkees abruptly cancelled the last nine dates on their reunion tour Friday, including several concerts in New England, the BBC reported.
Three of the original members of the made-for-TV band – Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Peter Tork – went back on the road earlier this year after a decade without performing. All three released statements Friday, saying the tour marking the band’s 45th anniversary could not continue, without specifying the reasons.
“I can say that the reasons pertain to business and are internal matters,” Mr. Dolenz, who is 66, wrote on his Facebook page. Mr. Tork, who is 69, released a separate statement: “I can only say that is has to do with business matters.”
The Monkees were formed in 1966 when NBC executives sought to capitalize on Beatlemania by producing a comedy featuring a Beatle-like group of singing mop tops. But the quartet, including Mike Nesmith, turned out to also be good musicians, and with some help from professional tunesmiths and a few of their own songs, the foursome scored several Top 40 hits in the late 1960s, among them “I’m a Believer,” “Last Train to Clarksville,” and “Daydream Believer.”

Background
A great deal of quieted talk has touched the ties between President Barack Obama and Bill Ayers. Since we didn't know much about Ayers, we did some research. We found that that he is married to Bernardine Dohrn, and both were leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Ayers and Dohrn were then part of a group that split off of the SDS and was called the Weathermen (Weather Underground). With that organization, they helped to facilitate arson attacks, explosions, and bombings in the early 1970's. They were arrested but all charges were later dismissed. The two are still married and live in Chicago.
Somewhere in the 1990's and early 2000's President Obama met David Axelrod and others who were friends and associates of Ayers and Dohrn. With the help of David Axelrod, Mr. Obama became a community organizer, then Senator, and finally President of the United States.
So what about the Ayers / Dohrn connection I wondered? The SDS sought to change America and promoted a socialist agenda. And, President Obama is trying to fundamentally change America. Is there any connection?
Well, interestingly enough, we found the "Port Huron Statement of the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962" posted online by "Courtesy Office of Sen. Tom Hayden".
This is quite a lengthy dissertation asserting the beliefs, objectives, and goals of the SDS. You may read it by following the above link.
Excerpts
In this document, we read many of the concepts and policies that the Obama Administration is promoting. As the President is running for re-election this year, he keeps repeating that his work is not complete. He does not reveal all that he intends for the United States, but perhaps the SDS Port Huron Statement will give us a hint. Below are a list of excerpts which we organized into various categories. These are all direct quotes from that document and were simply copied.
Hope and Change Motto
- ... the cheerful emptiness of people "giving up" all hope of changing things ...
- ... refusal to hope ...
- A new politics must include a revitalized labor movement; a movement which sees itself, and is regarded by others, as a major leader of the breakthrough to a politics of hope and vision.
- But fundamental social change -- that would ...
- The American political system is not the democratic model of which its glorifiers speak. In actuality it frustrates democracy by confusing the individual citizen, paralyzing policy discussion, and consolidating the irresponsible power of military and business interests.
-.
On Building Infrastructure
- America should agree that public utilities, railroads, mines, and plantations, and other basic economic institutions should be in the control of national, not foreign, agencies.
On Health Care
- the Federal government should guarantee health insurance as a basic social service turning medical treatment into a social habit, not just an occasion of crisis, fighting sickness among the aged, not just by making medical care financially feasible
On Prisons
- Our prisons are too often the enforcers of misery. They must be either re-oriented to rehabilitative work through public supervision or be abolished for their dehumanizing social effects. Funds are needed, too, to make possible a decent prison environment.
On the Fair Share and Equality and the 1 percent
- The wealthiest one percent of Americans own more than 80 percent of all personal shares of stock. From World War II until th
- Freedom and equality for each individual, ...
- More important, the new emphasis on the vote heralds the use of political means to solve the problems of equality in America, ...
On Organizing
- The organizing ability of the peace movement thus is limited to the ability to state and polarize issues.
On Education, Liberals & Socialists
-
- ... Equal educational opportunity is an important part of the battle against poverty. ...
- Education is too vital a public problem to be completely entrusted to the province of the various states and local units.
On Disarmament
- Disarmament should be see as a political issue, not a technical problem
-.
On Politics
- The American political system is not the democratic model of which its glorifiers speak. In actuality it frustrates democracy by confusing the individual citizen, paralyzing policy discussion, and consolidating the irresponsible power of military and business interests.
These are just excerpts from that document. We recommend that you read the entire document if you wish to learn more. Remember, these were written in 1962, forty years ago. However, they are just now being implemented.

How large/powerful/advanced is Westeros compared to the rest of the world?

As for Westeros it is obviously a more rural society that has had 300 years of stability and peace, and I think that it is actually a very nice place to live. I don`t think you could get commite some serious crime and not pay the price, at least before the War of the Five Kings. I think it is not fair to say that Westeros is backward when it has sufferd allmost 4 or 5 years of constant warring. When you look at the Vale or Dorne, which have been neutral, they seem like a nice place to live in, where your "civil rights" are respected in a manner you would expect for a society on a medieval status of development. Anyway that`s what I think. i don´t really like Essos based on Martins description of it.

They're not so much city-states as either principalities or even proper - but small, by Westerosi standards - nations
Illyrio implies in ADWD that the Dothraki destroy inland towns in Essos, but that's contradicted by the fact that Norvos, Qohor, and Selhorys are all large cities located inland, and by the fact that Pentos owns mines, farms, and villages in its hinterland..

And it's not like there isn't any crime in Braavos either. One of the first people Arya met in the House of Black and White was a mortally wounded in a street duel bravo who went there to commit a suicide so he'd die a painless death. Arya's relatively pleasant stay in Braavos might have come not from the city being a fine place to live in, but because of her status of a Faceless (Wo)Man in training; her adoptive family when she was Cat of the Canals certainly knew that. In comparison, Sam and co. didn't fare so good in Braavos when their money ran out - they were struggling to find even wood for fire and maester Aemon wasn't treated properly when he got ill.

But as Arya told Sam, you have to choose to duel by wearing your sword. It's actually safer to walk around at night unarmed, because they won't accost an unarmed man. There is obviously still violent crime - Svronne being the most glaring example - but all things considered, it's much, much safer than it is King's Landing.
Quote
Brusco knew she served the temple, but nobody else did. Everyone else that treated her almost as a mascot - the Happy Port, the King of Seals, the various foul-mouthed sailors & dockworkers who seemed quite protective of her - was a complete stranger. She was never robbed as Blind Beth, or ever even threatened. Sam was in desperate straits, but mostly because (1) he could barely speak Valyrian, and (2) he unsuitable for work at anything physical. I got the impression that just about any other man could have made their living as an oarsmen, or a longshoreman, and been treated pretty well for a foreigner.

Essos is just to barbaric for my taste, even with it´s big cities and everything, any place where slavery is normal can´t be a place where anyone would like to live or consider advanced.
One exception I have to add, I would love to ride across the Dothraki Sea... not as a Dothraki, but I would love to ride across it anyway, as Martin described it it seems like a wonderfull voayage.

Nation states? Seriously? You are speaking in terms of nation states?
As for the Dothraki laying waste to inland areas, that's called raiding. A very common thing historically. Just because you have raiders in the general area doesn't mean people abandon it.

The Seven Kingdoms covers most of the mapped area of Westeros. The area beyond the Wall is negligible in size on world maps. The area south of the Wall is comparable in size to Essos west of the Jade Sea as shown on the HBO maps. However, and this is something that has come to light only recently, the new GRRM-redrawn maps of Essos now show it to be considerably larger, which makes more sense in terms of the relationship between the two landmasses in the books..

Given the autonomy that each of the 'Great Lords' has as well as some of the lesser Lords like Bolton and Frey I don't think the Iron Throne is much stronger than the HRE - plus it doesn't even have the cultural binds that the HRE had.

I guess Westeros already had some unity, cultural unity (except for the North, Dorne and the Iron Islands), even before the Targaryen conquest, based upon the Common Tongue, the Faith of the Seven and the Order of Maesters. Those three factors helped the maintenance of the Realm, under the Dragons. Consider, exempli gratia, that Dorne is unlike any other place in Westeros, and it was the hardest kingdom to subdue (and they also employed guerrilla warfare, of course).

I do think there is a lot of ethnocentrism when it comes to thinking about Westeros, because they are well, Western, white and fairly patriarchal. And their medieval traits are just like the societies Western readers are used to in their histories. Also, all of the characters whose POV we read through are Westerosi. Clearly that is reflected on the information we have of Essos, and the way it is presented (usually in a negative light).
In terms of patriarchal values especially, it seems like Westeros and Essos are fairly similar: women are largely treated as property, either prostitutes or wives (to be sold and to pop out children regardless of their wishes), all around GRRM's world... except for the wildlings! We have a wonderful cast of women in the stories who live fascinating adventures and make their own lives, but they are clearly exceptions to the world that surrounds them. Women aren't protected from rape or slavery (whether in name like in Essos, or in practice like prostitutes and women married off by their families in Westeros) anywhere that we can see. They are not trained to attack nor defend themselves, and they don't have access to positions of power (military, political or intellectual, like the maesters).
The depiction and attitudes to homosexuality are quite interesting too. It seems that homosexuality exists (socially) between men (people make insinuations of Loras and Renly, people talk about boys being used as prostitutes for powerful men, and male rape occurring in military camps). Lesbian relationships are never, ever mentioned: we know of a few (Dany, Cersei) because we have the characters' POV, but they are not talked about socially (not even in a demeaning way). I think these two attitudes reflect historical approaches to male homosexuality in diverse cultures (e.g. rape of powerful man on boys accepted in ancient Greece, Inquisition persecution for sodomy) as opposed to practically total silence across the ages on the subject of lesbian relationships (with the famous exception of Sappho). My point is, in terms of LGBT rights, Essos and Westeros seem both to fail miserably. This includes general attitudes of dismissal of female sexuality and desire, which seems to be largely irrelevant in society (again, distinguish this from POVs).
On the subject of 'broader' human rights, slaves in Essos and serfs/peasants/the poor in the cities in Westeros seems to be equally miserable. Somebody before said that there seems to be little to none social mobility in Westeros: I think this point is very important when looking at human rights. The deeply entrenched class system that is the feudal system makes it impossible for most people to ever aspire to any sort of change. Both Westeros and the varied societies in Essos, with the possible exception of Braavos, seem to have a rigid class system with serfs/peasants or slaves at the bottom, doing the majority of the hard labour and enabling the ruling classes to live comfortably and entertain themselves with grabs for power. In this sense, I do not see much difference in terms of development between West and East either.
Now some of the Free Cities seem to have merchant classes and skilled guilds which in socio economic terms usually mean there is a bit more social mobility. The elite life is still out of reach for most, though. So this would be a detail, rather than an important trait of difference.
Finally, there are no civil or human rights neither in Westeros nor in Essos. There is no democratic system, no political grassroots interest organisations, no civil rights whatsoever. There is no separate system of justice in any of the societies we know (please correct me if I'm wrong, I've only read the books once) - when you are 'judged', you are judged by your lord or whoever is in power in your immediate vicinity. You are subject to their whims whatever you do; there is no law to protect civilians.

However, Pentos does buy them off, and maintains substantial armed forces. Illyrio seems to imply that the Dothraki would destroy inland towns regardless, but that doesn't seem to square with other evidence.

Its true there are no demoracies that fits the 21th century Western world view of it, but there are places where some form of people's power is used. In Volantis for example the freeborn landholds are allowed to vote on the Triarchs. Maybe not democratic as we know it but far more democratic than Westeros where birth decides who is in power. The other cities seems to favor some kind of oligarchy and while we wouldn't approve of it, its more people allowed to take a part than in some other places.

I dont think its fair to compare arya´s hard life in flea bottom with cat of cannal´s or blind beggars´s in order to say Braavos is a better place to live than Westeros.
In Flea Botton, she was scared little girl (stupid as she says) with no money, friends, flleing from queen´s soldiers, And she had no great skill.
In Bravoos, she was trained, had some food, and was endured by her past. And she had some hard time getting well at night and I think it were flea bottom´s arya, she would have goten in trouble.
I think that Westeros looks like a better place to live than essos for the common men altough the free cities seems to be more technonoligical advances.
Besides that, everything considered, I think westeros combned power is greater , even military, Its a more stable, it has more land, natural resources, and its population is much bigger .
Most of westerosi army may be light armed peasents, but their number would be much greater and they still would have the best warrior avaiable, the full plated kinght.
Maybe westeros couldnt invade the Free Cities. Their navy seems to be much smaller.
But i cant see the free cities or any other esses nation conquering westeros.
Even Dany´s unsulied army alone would have little chance, the way i see it. To conquer westeros, u need westerosi men.

The Mongols already proved in Eastern Europe that knights were no match for them whatsoever. They'd also proven throughout Asia that they could fight in almost any terrain. And it doesn't help at all when many of the Western European nations were constantly at war or fragmented.
However, the Dothraki are just poor rip offs of the Mongols. Dothraki don't wear armour, Mongols did. Dothraki can't really penetrate heavy armour, Mongols could. The Dothraki were rarely unified into huge hordes, the Mongols were unified for the majority of the 13th century.
The Dothraki would get slaughtered by the Westerosi.

And on top off all he runs out of money witch he spend on healer for Aemon .
i think Sam run out luck here so comparing his situation isnt fair.

Career Spotlight: Jeffrey Scott Shapiro
Jeffrey Scott Shapiro Jeffrey Scott Shapiro (JD 05) began each week like any other UF Law student, consumed with classes and studying. Come most Thursdays, however, he was boarding a Colorado-bound plane to work as an investigative journalist for CBS News’ “48 Hours Investigates.”
When Mondays rolled back around, he was sitting in his law classes once again, ready to repeat the cycle.
Shapiro’s journalism background and law career has come full circle, now that he has been prosecuting cases related to the First Amendment for the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C. for the last year and a half.
“Since I used to be a journalist, I have an interest in the First Amendment,” Shapiro said. “I think I may be one of the only prosecutors in the country who prosecutes cases that somehow seriously involve First Amendment law.”
He deals with many protestors participating in unlawful conduct at the White House, U.S. Capitol, and other federal properties, particularly specializing in cases with mass protestors. Shapiro has prosecuted as many as 31 codefendants in one trial.
Shapiro has also worked on high-profile cases, just recently prosecuting and subsequently convicting a woman who accosted Condoleezza Rice on Capitol Hill with hands painted red to look like blood.
However, dealing with high-profile issues is nothing new to this journalism veteran, as he spent his seven years after his Florida State University undergraduate education as an investigative reporter. He covered stories that included the JonBenet Ramsey murder case, Columbine shootings, Chandra Levy investigation and Sept. 11 attacks. These experiences exposed him to the intersection of the law and media and the problems that can occur.
“My real interest in going to law school was because I had an interest in First Amendment law,” Shapiro said. “I feel that the media abuses the First Amendment a lot, and I was hoping to go to law school so I could eventually represent people who were victims of that abuse.”
This knowledge initially came from his beginning in journalism as a reporter for tabloids. In this capacity, he witnessed the abusive way the First Amendment was regarded in news coverage about JonBenet Ramsey. Shapiro ended up reporting these publications to the FBI, which led to a criminal prosecution and his testimony before a grand jury.
Shapiro’s journalism career quickly ascended, as he went from employment at the tabloid, The Globe, to publication in Time Magazine. Just before law school, he was working for Gannett in New York City.
“I actually spent a few months in Manhattan and all of the New York City area working on 9/11 and trying to track down information about Al-Qaeda, and then I came back to Florida and started law school,” he said. “You can kind of imagine the culture shock.”
Law school didn’t deter Shapiro from journalistic endeavors. In addition to his academic work and involvement in the Military Law Students Association, he wrote some stories and columns and made appearances on television shows, including the “The O’Reilly Factor.”
The summer after his first year, Shapiro was contacted by “48 Hours Investigates” to conduct a preliminary investigation on the Kobe Bryant case. This involved extensive time in Colorado that summer, extending into his second and third years of law school.
This commitment also required a class schedule conducive to long weekends traveling to cover the case.
“It was like I was living two lives at the same time,” Shapiro said. “It was a fun experience because I got to fly out of town every other week. It was a bit exotic for a full-time student, but it was also pretty exhausting.”
Shapiro described the Kobe Bryant case as beneficial in two ways. He was able to witness concepts he was learning in classes in the real world and also had the ability to grasp complex legal issues brought up in hearings that very few reporters would be able to clearly understand without a legal education.
“The Kobe Bryant case was sort of a whole part of my law school education,” Shapiro said.
The still full-time law student decided he had enough information on the Kobe Bryant case to write a book. “Kobe Bryant: The Game of His Life” was published in February of 2004 and broke an Amazon.com Top 100 sales during the first week it was released.
Upon graduating, Shapiro encountered another event that ultimately translated into his second book – bar preparation.
Shapiro didn’t pass his first bar exam in June 2005, which he had the unfortunate timing of taking right after the bar examiners’ decision to rewrite the test just six weeks before. This was due to a bar preparation course’s successful duplication of actual exam questions.
His second shot at the exam missed the mark by just one point.
At that point he had a bar tutor, Steve Friedland, who used to teach at Nova Southeastern University Law Center. Friedland had devised a methodology based on a system of protocols. For every section of the bar, he created a system a student should use to approach each subject.
“He had this great system he had developed, and I was very impressed,” Shapiro said.
The idea to write another book sparked, and Shapiro used his own writing experience combined with Friedland’s material to write a book co-authored by the two, entitled “The Essential Rules for Bar Exam Success.” The book serves as a bridge between the last year of law school and the start of bar preparation courses, since it can be an abrupt shift.
An important aspect of the book, which focuses on the Multistate Bar Examination, is understanding the language of the exam and teaching students how to “think the way the bar examiners think,” said Shapiro.
Shapiro passed the bar the third time, an accomplishment he credits to applying the protocols in the book.
Shapiro says the most valuable aspect of the book is preparing a third year law student for the psychological and emotional shift that accompanies bar exam preparation.
“This book really helps you understand every aspect of studying for the bar. It’s not just about the bar exam itself,” Shapiro said. “It’s about what is going to happen to your life when you enter this Twilight Zone called bar exam class.”
The book was published a few weeks ago by Thomson West with complimentary copies sent to every law school in the country. All law school bookstores, as well as select Barnes & Nobles and Borders bookstores, will be selling the book. Thomson West also selected the book as one of only two selected each year for its professional series.
A strong writing background has influenced more than his current legal specialty, as Shapiro is now working on his third book. The story is about a forbidden love that takes place in a future utopian society, complete with civil rights issues he learned about in Constitutional Law.
“There were a lot of things learned at UF that I wrote about in my stories,” Shapiro said. “If I hadn’t had that education at UF, I never would have been able to write those stories with the punch that they had.”

"Marriage is an adventure, like going to war."
I saw this quote by English writer G. K. Chesterton a week before my wedding day as I browse the internet for ideas for a groom’s message. Perfect timing, right?
Honestly, it made me paused for a while and asked myself, “Am I really ready for marriage?”
In the midst of a confused mind, a cluttered computer table and a slice of cold pizza that afternoon, my phone rang. It was Leah.
While listening to her soothing voice and sweet nothings, memories of some of the best moments of our relationship just hit me from left to right. From our very first hello to the biggest hugs we gave each other after coming back from a two-year work stint overseas. From our first kiss to the scariest day of my life when she went under the knife to remove her unfriendly gallbladder.
It’s was like a roller-coaster ride already and we’re not yet married. It could definitely be a war once we tie the knot since we might still give each other ‘surprises” when we start to live under one roof.
But after our conversation over the phone, I felt a big smile was just painted on my face. I realized that if there is one person that I’d like to be on my side in any battle that I’ll meet in life along the way, I want nobody but her.
We got married on December of 2006. We vowed to be each other’s pillar of strength and wall to lean on in times of trouble. We swore to overcome any obstacle life has to offer but never expected that the first two years of our married life is indeed a big war. In August 2007, we lost our first child due to birth complications. Baby Monique just lived for a day. After three months, a time I have yet fully recovered emotionally, my brother Jimmy died at the young age of 21. The following year, Leah lost her beloved lolo due to a lung disease.
At first, we could not understand the series of tragedies that hit us. Why us? We’re just a couple whose only wish is to have a happy family life but got to start on a sour note. But as they say, time heals all wounds. In 2009, we got the best blessing of our lives--- our son Charles. Despite having asthma (something he inherited from me) and a record of 9-day hospital confinement due to pneumonia on his 9th month, Charles is our source of strength and inspiration for me and my wife. We worked hard every day with him and his future in our minds. Now, we understand why we have each other. Through the years, we have become a team that has overcome every trial we encountered in life and got stronger after surviving the storms.
Six years and counting, I can’t recall any major major argument or tsunami walk out in our household. I just can’t stand to hurt the Ms. Universe of my life. We live a simple life but we make each other feel like a king and queen in the best way we can. We are a royal couple who share an order of large French fries from our favorite fast food shop, wrestle our way in a crowded Sabado market for our week’s supply, and do the laundry even after coming from an 8-hour toxic work load. These and other routines might sounds a little boring to some but for us, we don’t mind doing the same things over and over again for as long as we have each other’s company.
Speaking of doing the laundry, I want to share what I believe are secrets to a long-lasting relationship based on personal experiences. I want to do a list using the brand of detergent soap that we’ve been using at home ever since. And so I say, if you want a long-lasting relationship, think of TIDE:
Trust. Do not do something that will put a stain on your spouse’s trust on you. Give the assurance that even you’re away interacting with other people who have better abs or longer shinier hair, the only number that you’ll give away to a flirting stranger looking for a place to stay is 117. Although sometimes, feeling a little jealous is okay but it should easily be dissolved with a spoon of sugar-sweet message (Note: not sugar-coated). But I have to admit, my wife can’t trust me with unattended slice of cake or tub of ice cream in the ref.
Intimacy. Would you believe that after six years of being a married couple, I still make “ligaw” to my wife? That’s even I did not do anything wrong. I just wanted it that way. Call me a sentimental fool or what but I still make “kilig” every time her face blushes or lights up with a poem I have composed, flowers I sent to her office or a favorite song or movie she been looking for was downloaded. I want to fulfil my wedding vow (yup, the one that I drafted with inspiration from Mr. Chesterton) that I will do anything that can make my wife happy.
Devotion. The word is synonymous to love, loyalty and fidelity. Just choose one and paste it on your heart and you’re good to go. But it’s easier said than done. For me, devotion is the ideal response to the trust that your better half gives you. That whether she is near or far, wherever you are, believe that the heart does go on... only for her! A Titanic task to some but it’s the tip of the iceberg of many successful love stories.
Excitement. Who doesn’t like surprises? From teething toddlers to old folks loosing teeth to single individuals by choice and married people to their chosen ones, a moment of excitement is a welcome treat anytime of the day. As much as I wanted to enumerate the many surprises that I gave my wife since Day 1, I might need a separate blog post or two for a complete listing (I am not kidding). But what I can share is a 12-minute video of a feature in GMA 7’s Wish Ko Lang where I surprised my wife of a gift that I asked for her.
I have always believed that a successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. I will never regret that day I exchanged I do’s with my wife Leah until my last breath. And if in case I’ll be given another chance to live again, I will write to the same TV show for the second time and request if I can possibly be granted of the li.fe I had before--- in the arms of the woman of my dreams.
Here’s another video that I hope can inspire anyone who watches it to aim in building a long-lasting relationship with their loved ones. It features stories of how love continues to live on and grow despite of distance and despair. It's also good to hear that brands like Tide, which has been a part of many Filipinos' lives for many generation has come up with a wonderful project as a way of recognizing couples who have overcome obstacles and great sacrifices in the name of love. A truly commendable gesture from Tide that is now fortified with Downy for a truly more sweet-smelling experience for all its loyal fans.
Whether you’re in love or still looking for that someone to love, this clip will surely give you a taste of what a “Pag-ibig na Pangmatagalan” is all about.

Locks and keys ring up huge costs for education institutions. When a student forgets a residence hall key, someone has to let the student in. When a student loses a key, a locksmith has to cut a new key and re-key the lock. On a campus with thousands of students, such problems can use up hours of expensive time.
No wonder many facility directors and public-safety directors have turned to automated access-control systems with magnetic-stripe cards, proximity cards and, most recently, smart cards.
Smart cards can provide a host of on- and off-campus services beyond security. In addition to serving as identification credentials and opening access-controlled doors, they can facilitate purchases at vending machines by accessing debit accounts, checking books out from the library and much more.
Around the corner
An emerging technology called near field communication (NFC) enables smartphones to do everything a contactless smart card can do—and then some.
Devices enabled with NFC can communicate with each other. An NFC-enabled smartphone, for instance, could pay for merchandise in a store. The buyer would open up a credit card app and present the phone to an NFC-enabled credit card reader. The phone would transmit the credit card number to the reader, which would process the transaction with lightning speed.
On campus, NFC technology can play a role in campus safety and security. By enabling contactless smart card access-control readers with NFC, students, faculty and staff could use smartphones to gain access to residence halls and other buildings across campus.
Why is that a good idea? The system is simple to administer and to use. It eliminates the cost of buying and printing tens of thousands of smart cards, which can cost $2 to $10 or more per card. It enhances security, and students want it. NFC-enabled smartphones can do anything a smart card can do.
An easier way
To start up such a system, a system administrator would create an electronic mobile key, enabling access to appropriate doors, for each member of the campus community.
The keys are stored in a secure cloud environment accessible only by those with an activated PIN number. Next, e-mail invitations would be sent to the community explaining the system and inviting everyone to enroll. The invitation would include a unique PIN number for each recipient.
Upon receiving an invitation, a student could do nothing and continue using a card, or he or she could download an access app and enroll in the system by using the PIN number to log onto the cloud and download the mobile key created by the administrator.
To use the app to enter a residence hall, a student would open the app and tap the phone on the reader—which, of course, must be NFC-enabled.
An NFC-enabled campus can replace a one-card offering with a one-phone system that does everything a one-card program can do. Enable the campus laundry facilities, vending machines, library checkout desk, cafeteria and other campus facilities with NFC, and smartphones can replace plastic.
Moreover, NFC can make a smartphone into an educational tool. The campus art gallery, for instance, could have an app that visitors can download upon entering. During the walkthrough, visitors can tap their phones on enabled NFC buttons to call up audiovisual presentations about artists and their work.

According to the study, diagnosed type 2 diabetes accounted for $174.4 billion of 2007 spending on diabetes and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes was responsible for $18 billion in costs. Spending on type 1 diabetes totaled $14.9 billion. Gestational diabetes was associated with $636 million in costs. Pre-diabetes, a state that affects one in four adults in the U.S. and is a precursor to diabetes, cost $25 billion. The analysis examined both direct medical costs, which accounted for $153 billion in spending, and $65 billion in indirect costs associated with absenteeism and disease-related productivity losses.
The average type 2 diabetic cost nearly $10,000 per year, while a pre-diabetic cost only $443 in additional medical costs. Many pre-diabetics can avoid type 2 diabetes with life style changes, thereby reducing much of the medical costs.

“The decor is fun and interesting and the bar-food menu is top notch --especially the burgers.”
“The staff is friendly and inviting, and the waitresses are extremely attractive and serve strong, stiff drinks.”
“best burgers in Atlanta!”
“Multiple options for burgers and the other sandwiches are equally good.”
“The best burgers, bar food, and beer selection if you like a different kind of place.”
“As a business owner myself I personally think that know matter how much the food cost, you should receive good service.”
“Great burger joint with a huge menu of food.”
“My only negative comment is that the service was a little slow.”
Pass over the bypass and just get the original; I love the seediness of this place!
Vortex Midtown - What a let Down pure seedy and disappointin. Me think not. How appropriate summary for that establishment. Not sure how they got the good reviews, if that were their buddies or now, but our experience was anything but good. The restaurant felt seedy with pictures of nude women in the bar and wait staff that was very "up -nosed" and overall provided bad service. They do have a very large nice bar, but again, the service was slow and not very good, so if you are ok with slow and not so good service, you will get decent burgers and fries - that is all I can say about the food - then you're ok. It felt like a college bar where the beers should be $1.50, but they were not, so in summary, we did not have a good experience at all, which is strange since The Vortex has a good reputation.
Good Burgers. This place has the best tasting burgers, but I hate the fact that it is really greasy. The service isn't all that great, they are slow with orders, and not all that friendly. Outside of that I mean its a good place to hang out, there are always people there, and the vibe is good.
RUDE! NEVER GO HERE!. I just called to place a to go order because I have a broken hand and live a block away. The guy that answered they phone snapped at me and said he wouldn't take a to go order because he was too busy -- and the hung up the phone on me. I will never EVER patronize this establishment. If you want a good burger, go to Houston's!!!
My visit to this restaurant really made my day.. I have always loved burgers. I liked the succulent taste of burgers in this restaurant. They offer different variations which I love. My visit to this restaurant really made my day.
SUB STANDARD FOOD, EVEN WORSE EMPLOYEES. Do not buy the hype and gimmick - Vortex is TERRIBLE! The food is sub-standard bar food at best. Their burgers are one step above McDonalds and their fries are equivalent to microwavable fries (McDonalds fries are actually better). In short, the burger and fries were not fresh and had no flavor. To make matters worse, the service is HORRIBLE! The hostess (or one of) is rude, condescending, and in my experience, racist! When I complained to the manager, he told me I was being ridiculous. I would never go back to Vortex again! When visiting Atlanta, I highly recommend you avoid this trashy and smoke filled place. There are a lot of other restaurants in the area worthy of your business. Also, if you are going with a GROUP, this is definetly NOT the place for you - they will not seat you unless everyone in your party is present. They refuse to allow you to change your party size once you've given it to them, so you're definitely out of luck if someone decides not to show up. They will not seat you! As ridiculous as it might appear, this is apparently their policy! Dining at Vortex is THE WORST dining experience I have ever had! I'm giving it a one star, but only because I can't give it a ZERO STAR.
Every Man's Dream. Featured on the Food Network as Top 100 Places to Dine in America, the Vortex has a naughty atmosphere with some mouth watering greasy cheeseburgers. What more could every man ask for? With multiple locations across Atlanta, The Vortex's menu is unlike any other in the city. Countless choices of burgers, sandwiches, and more. They even have a burger that is smashed between 2 grilled cheeses and has 8 pieces of bacon pushed in between two giant patties. If you are coming to Atlanta with a group of guys, this is the place to go for dinner. Tattoed waitresses that are not there to mushy up to you take your order and keep it real. This place is ALWAYS 18 and up and is definitely not the place to take the kiddies!
Why all the accolades?.
All I have heard is Vortex, Vortex for best hamburgers in Atlanta. When I hear that I always take it with a grain of salt considering who is heaping on the accolades. I was pretty disappointed when we ate there yesterday. It was quiet after the lunch rush yet it took at least 10 minutes for waitress to come introduce herself and take our drink order.
We ordered two burgers exactly the same except for I wanted mine medium well, the hubs got his cooked medium. When gent from the kitchen delivered our order, he specifically asked who got the medium and who got the medium well burger. Okay, great I thought (attention to detail) until I got half-way through the burger and thought hey this isn't cooked very evenly since I discovered some major pink in the center of the burger. We then realized our burgers were mixed up but by then the hubs had already scarfed up half of his burger. He thought his burger was nicely seasoned but on the dry side. Even my mistakenly-medium burger wasn't juicy at all. The requisite fries were nothing to write home about.
I have had much better, juicier burgers at Five Guys and at a little hole in the wall in Cleveland, GA called Yonah Burger.
Yes, the Vortex decor is interesting, albeit a tad junky, but that isn't enough to bring me back. Atlanta has so many places to eat that we are going to try some others. Why bother with just mediocre?
Food is great...but hate the atmosphere.... There was quite a wait, so we grabbed a seat at the bar and ate there. The food was excellent, but my alergies can't handle the piles of cigarette smoke. I will go back, but it will probably be on an "Annual Basis" rather than monthly.
NOW HAS AN ALTERNATIVE COMEDY CLUB?!..
Like a 60s hangout that never was...

“I just wanted to send you a note to thank you for the amazing positive change you have made to my life. I signed up for your STL Breakthrough Course towards the end of last year and enjoyed every minute (even addressing all the difficult questions I had to ask myself!) I absolutely loved the tele classes and the homework too; it made such a difference making the time to sit down and do all the exercises.I read your book around the same time and even though there was no-one in my life (romantically) and no-one on the horizon, I just kept on keeping the faith and telling myself that I should really enjoy all this time to myself because I never knew when I would be in a relationship and be busy with the man of my dreams!
Cutting Ties with Ex and Moving On to Find LOVE
I had a long time, on again off again, affair with a man in OKC who had been getting divorced for about 5 yrs. It was very unhealthy and I was having a hard time letting go. I had met another man who I was very impressed with and wanted to see where that would go, but realized that my energy being divided in the way it was, would probably get in the way.
We did a couple of sessions and cut the ties with the man in OKC. Well long story short, David, the new man is now very much in my life! He is everything I have ever dreamed of! When I looked at my list of my ideal mate, he fits 95%! We are so happy. And planning to be married sometime within the next year. So thank you. thank you~ – DM, Denver, CO
During a singles event in February 2009 I participated in your “heart light” exercise designed to attract love. In my mind a dark, backlit figure approached me. I never saw his face. We had a warm, short chat, and then parted, saying we’d see each other soon. We hugged and I felt and saw that he was wearing a soft black sweater with white flecks in it. Later that night, a black man bumped into me at the singles event. We connected immediately. He was wearing a soft black sweater with white flecks in it! Since then he and I have been nearly inseparable. At 52, I had given up hope of finding my life match, but this man possesses all of the qualities I seek. How amazing to know that I first saw this incredible human being in my mind during the heart light exercise, and then met the real deal about an hour later. Imagine that! Thanks, Deb.
Barbara -Denver, Colorado
Debra took me through a hypnosis session on career and prosperity and a session on finding my lifetime partner, and after listening to both sessions on a daily basis I have noticed significant changes in my career opportunities and in the attention that men give me. I feel like my self-confidence and self worth have grown exponentially because of working with Debra. I very highly recommend her services.
DLH-Washington, DC
It works!
“Since my divorce nearly 6 years ago, my dating experience was one “dud” after another. A friend gave me the Attract the Love of Your Life CD, and I listened to it before bed a few times….within the next 30 days, I met the love of my life! For the first time ever, I am enjoying feeling loved, appreciated, being romanced, in a loving relationship. I recommend this CD to anyone who is ready to meet the love of his/her life! R.H. – Denver, CO
“Looks like the wedding will probably be May 18th. I’m really excited! Thanks! I really do think the hypnosis for attracting a loving partner was what helped draw us to each other!”

Hi Deb, Ruddy, Denver, Coloradoada
Clearing Blocks
Deb is just an absolutely extraordinary woman in my eyes. The work that she has done with me has helped to release an issue that I have been unable to release for years even doing work with other people. And, it occurred in only one session with her. Both on a personal and a professional level Deb has always been such a huge support to me and I am eternally grateful for not only who she is for me, but who she is for everyone.
-Darcy Volden Hoag, Founder, Secrets Of Her Success –
I wanted to let you know how you have affected my life. I had been practicing the law of attraction for a year or so before I discovered you. I desired to increase my income, but knew I had prejudices against money and was struggling. I checked out a book from the library on self-hypnosis thinking I could teach myself to break down those barriers. Well, I guess I attracted you because shortly after that I saw you on 7 News at a very odd time for me to be tuning in. I ended up ordering Creative Wealth from your website and have increased my pay by 60%! And all in less than one year. Thank you for your part in that!
I really think highly of your products, and value your insight.

Manifest ANYthing! Program
Manifest Anything is one of Amazon’s happy little surprises–it’s too soon to tell if I’m going to manifest my own “anything” (my goal is rather long-term), but I can say that everything about this CD, from the recording quality, to the very pleasant and soothing voice, to the visions it inspires, is absolutely top-quality. Manifestation aside, it’s like a visit to the spa, and you emerge from the experience feeling rested, energized, and full of confidence that the rest of the day will go well.
I noticed that a reviewer of another of Debra Berndt’s cds was disappointed that the length of the session on that CD wasn’t very long. This one isn’t, either, but that, in my estimation, is one of its strengths. I have other CDs of this genre that range from half an hour to an hour, and frankly, I just won’t use them because it takes too large a chunk of my time to use them regularly as I should. At about 15 minutes, this session is perfect–and trust me, it’s packed with valuable imagery and suggestions. It’s the best 15 minutes of my day!
If you have a spare 15 minutes, give this one a try. I think you’ll be glad you did!
J.G., Lexington, KY
I LOVE your Manifest Anything! program. Ever since I started listening to it, I have seen so many shifts in my life. A new business opportunity which I am really excited about and is taking off. Your program helps me remember that I am in control of my own destiny. Thank you for what you do!

About the Breakup Recovery CD:
“This has helped me tremendously. I will say though at first I seemed to have got stuck on the letting go part. Everything about me felt as though I needed to let go, but my heart seemed sad about it or something. I am not sure how to put it into words. I did, however, stick with it and little by little I started feeling a lot better. But with continuing and not giving up, I feel like it has helped me now get a hold of my situation and start to move forward. I am reading again and starting to enjoy the things I do have in my life, and I credit the CD for that. Maybe it forced me to go through a mourning period first in order to move forward.” C.T., Denver, CO
Accepting Love: Confidence in a New Relationship CD
“I loved the CD! Volume is great and the content was more than I could have ever imagined. What a boost to my self-esteem. I listened to it for the first time yesterday and listened to it four times before the day was over. I had the best sleep last night than I have had for a couple years. It is very hard for me to relax and sit still for any amount of time, but I did it not once but four times yesterday.” K.S., Denver, CO.

LET LOVE IN BOOK REVIEWS From Amazon:
The Most Powerful Healing Tool for Love I’ve Seen
This book is truly masterful, getting to core issues that prevent someone from finding love. I’ve been a dating coach since 2002, working with thousands of women over 40, read countless books on dating and have written three of my own. That said, Debra helps the reader get to the bottom of and transform beliefs that get in the way of love. This is not a superficial approach to dating. It’s for the woman who is ready to transform her romantic karma once and for all to find lasting love. Don’t wait another minute to purchase this book. -Ronnie Ann Ryan, CT
flawless
This book unfolds magnificently. Its genius is in the way it leads you to yourself. Debra wastes no pages, paragraphs, sentences, or even words because the honesty demands a kind of efficiency one rarely finds in books of this genre. By being ruthlessly honest with herself, she is able to offer the reader thorough purity. While reading “Let Love In”, you will surely ask yourself tough questions which I guarantee will prove invaluable as you realize your thinking patterns and attachments. Part of the fun is that the tough questions are accompanied by bright little light bulbs – whether you are male or female. Before opening to page 1, I was apprehensive that this book would only speak to women, but these principles, ideas, and exercises are translatable across genders and even relevant to other aspects of life. The title of this book could just as easily be, LET LIFE IN. I certainly plan to. A.S., New York, NY
A New and Refreshing Book on Finding Love
I have to say that I was very impressed by this book. I have read a lot of books on dating, and attracting the right person and it was so refreshing to read a book that is focused on healing feelings of unworthiness and learning how to empower yourself and create a strong and healthy self image. I am married, but found many pearls of wisdom that I will be able to incorporate into my life in all areas. I will be reading this a second time and referring to it often.
-Marla Martensen, Author of Diary of a Beverly Hills Matchmaker
If you had to read one book, this is it!
This is one of the best books I’ve read on relationships and the subconscious mind. It’s written in an easy-to-understand and straightforward way. What sets this book apart from other self-help/dating books in the market is that the author zeroes in on the crux of the problem, instead of glossing over it like most of the self-help books out there. She lays out the groundwork by clearly explaining the functions of the subconscious mind and its effects on our lives. She also demystifies the stereotype and false beliefs surrounding hypnosis. She makes you delve deep into your psyche by making you question the origin of your core beliefs and then guides you through a step-by-step self-hypnosis exercises in order to tap into your subconscious mind and rewire your internal software. When the conscious mind isn’t alligned with the subconscious mind’s core beliefs then we unwittingly attract unfavorable partners and situations. Our conscious mind desires to find love, a healthy relationship and a happy marriage, but our subconscious mind believes it’s far-fetched and impossible. As a result, we find ourselves caught in the same horrible cycle. The conscious mind and the subconscious mind must work harmoniously together in order to create favorable situations in our lives and to magnetize men/women who are nurturing, honest, and compatible.

Debi,
This is Linda from the call last night. Just wanted to let you know that you caused a major shift and have given me alot to think about and meditate about.
I have been doing work on myself for years, but the insight that you provided me about False Self Esteem was the piece of the puzzle I was missing. For years I was an over achiever to get attention from my parents and I did not realize until your response yesterday that I was so dependent on the opinion of others in my life. Thank you for that gift. I do now need to ask…who am I? from an authentic place. I am so glad I was on the call and I am so thankful that I had the courage to share.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, and of course bless you.

Dearest Debi
I just want to thank you from my Heart, for your free 3 part lectures on how to find true love.
Not to bore you with a very long story of my life that could make a blockbuster. But to say that very very much of what you say, I have been through. Unfortunately my BS ( no matter how much I have worked on my self). Has left me in a situation where I am today on pre pension, with load of financial depth. My whole physical and psychological system has suffer major. I have PTSD. No matter if I stayed single for years, and did watch out, over and over, Even though I did pray very much, and wish to be with Batman I always ended up with Lex Luther! I understand everything you say with my intellect, but I still do not understand what I don’t understand, and what I do wrong. I just had a relationship for almost a year ( after being Single for four years, by choice). the guy seemed nice, religious background, Masters degree, no over charming attitude! still he turned out to have told me one lie after the other lie, I was chocked and deeply hurt!
I want my life, I want to live I want to be happy! Help me GOD and sweet Debi
Thank you very very much.

Celebrities have taken to Twitter to mourn those who lost their lives, were impacted or moved by the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday in Newtown, Conn.
While police reports have not yet released the civilian casualty information, news outlets like CNN are estimating that as many as 25 people, 18 of which may include children, were killed in the shooting. Many others were injured but an official number was not given by police. Unconfirmed reports also said the principal Dawn Hochsprung and a school psychologist were killed in the shooting, as well.

Celebrities have taken to Twitter to share their thoughts about the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday in Newtown, Conn.
Connecticut State Police initially identified the shooter only as a 20-year-old male, who was dead inside the school building after using a high-powered .223-caliber assault rifle.
However, recent reports indicated the shooter was 24-year-old Ryan Lanza, who was found dead on the sight of the shooting. He was reportedly wearing dark clothing, a mask, a bulletproof vest and carrying a total of four guns. Police have not given a cause of death.
Unconfirmed reports said Lanza had a connection to the school and both of his parents were reportedly dead.
The shooting began around 9:40 a.m. inside of the elementary school where an estimated 600 students in grades K-4 weret. J. Paul Vance said the scene of the shooting was secure and the police are in "search warrant activity."
“The scene is secure. The public is not in danger,” says Connecticut State Police spokesman Paul Vance.
As one of the deadliest school shootings in history, celebrities have taken to Twitter to share their condolences for the tragedy.

The State Coroner has been scathing of the treatment and care given to a Perth mother-of-two who suffered "horrific" complications from an elective stomach stapling operation and died six months later.
Julienne McKay-Hall, 46, had the weight loss surgery on November 9, 2007 at St John of God Hospital in Murdoch. The stapling gun used by surgeon Dr Hairul Ahmad misfired during the surgery. The misfire caused a stomach leak, which resulted in Mrs McKay-Hall developing sepsis. Her condition went undiagnosed for three days.
In his findings handed down today, State Coroner Alastair Hope was critical of the "inexcusable failure" by Dr Ahmad and nurses to properly monitor and urgently address the patient's alarming and deteriorating condition.
Mrs McKay-Hall underwent numerous surgeries, spent months in hospital and died in May 2008 after an operation to fix a leaking abdominal fistula at Fremantle Hospital.
Mr Hope described Dr Ahmad's actions, which included not reading critical notes and not coming into the hospital to see Mrs McKay-Hall when a nurse called him about her worsening vital signs, as "grossly inadequate" and referred him to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.
Mr Hope said failure to take regular observations of the patient, particularly when she became "close to death", constituted a gross failure by the hospital and nurses involved in her treatment.
Mr Hope said Mrs McKay-Hall's death was a result of "misadventure" and found the "poor quality of treatment and care" by Dr Ahmad and nurses "contributed to her death".
Mr Hope made two recommendations, including calling for improved communication and recording by nurses about patients' abnormal vital signs and for a system of audits to examine if hospitals adequately deal with emergencies.
Mr Hope expressed his sympathies to Mrs McKay-Hall's family for their extreme distress over the "sad, tragic and unnecessary death".
The elective surgery was a relatively new procedure in 2007 and involved removing a large portion of stomach and stapling the remaining part of the stomach. Mrs McKay-Hall, who weighed 111kg before the procedure, chose the drastic action to improve her quality of life.
Outside court, Tanya Watson, lawyer for Mrs McKay-Hall's family, said the family was satisfied with the coronial investigation and that the Coroner had confirmed its suspicions of sub-standard care.
She said the family may consider pursuing compensation.
A spokesman for St John of God Health Care said the hospital remained deeply saddened by Mrs McKay-Hall's death and it co-operated fully with the coronial inquest. He said the hospital would examine the findings carefully and where relevant it would review policies, procedures and practices.The spokesman said the hospital investigated and suspended Dr Ahmad in 2008 and that suspension remains.

My first experience of a croque monsieur comes on the French fast train the TGV from Antibes to Lyon.
My long-forgotten schoolgirl French doesn't register exactly what it is that I'll be eating, but others are getting it and it sounds exotic.
We crack open a bottle of wine, sipped from plastic cups in the train's first-class section, and tuck into our lunch selections as we happily while away the four hours.
So the croque monsieur? Well, all I'll tell you for now is that it's a popular cafe classic and it's the start of my gastronomic journey from one end of France to the other.
I had no idea when we set out that the 10-day trip to discover France "off the beaten tracks" would also be something of an awakening for a non-foodie like me.
Our journey takes us from Nice, the queen of the French Riviera, to Paris, the love capital of the world. In between: many charming cities and surrounding areas, from Nice to Antibes to Lyons to Moulins to Vichy to Amboise to Nantes to Vannes to Paris; and more than a few sumptuous three-course meals.
We fly into Nice and after that it's trains all the way, apart from a few van drives here and there.
The initial rail journey, on which I discover the joys of a croque monsieur, takes us to Lyons.
It is here, in the gastronomic capital of France, that I face my first real challenge with French food.
Lyons boasts 2000 restaurants, 14 with Michelin stars.
Many call themselves bouchons, the traditional Lyonnaise restaurants.
But, says our guide Christine Barniaud, there's only 10 that you would call authentic bouchons.
"There's no classification," the promotion officer with the Lyons Tourist Office says, "but we know the good ones - it's the atmosphere, it's the food and the welcome."
We end up at Cafe des Federations, where the menu boasts black pudding with apple, calf head with ravigote sauce, cake of chicken livers and stew of pork cheeks.
What does the non-foodie choose? Chicken with vinegar. A nice meal but a fail when it comes to living up to the challenge to be adventurous.
Gradually, however, as we travel through France, this boring eater starts sampling more out-there fare: gizzard in Clermont-Ferrand (barely enough to register what I'd eaten) and steak tartare in Moulins (surprisingly pleasing, but I prefer my meat to be cooked).
I've discovered I'm particularly partial to the Auvergne region's potato-and-cheese dish truffade: creamy, rich and filling.
By the time we leave behind the red-tile roofs of the south of France and cross further north, where blue slate abounds, I'm even trying eel (a very fishy taste, one bit was enough for me) in the fishing village of Trentemoult, opposite the port of Nantes.
Somewhere along the way, I've acquired the habit of drinking an aperitif before dinner. It seems imperative now.
And I've also picked up a few tips about travelling by train:
• Pack light. It's not like a plane trip. There's no checking in your luggage and collecting it at the other end. You need to lift your suitcase on and off the train and find somewhere to store it. (There are storage areas but they vary.) If you can't carry your own suitcase you've packed too much - unless there's someone with you who will help you lift it.
• The TGV has assigned seats, so you must book. There are no seat reservations with the regional TERs.
• There's not much difference between first and second class on the regional trains, except for the leg-room. On the TGV, the difference is a bit more obvious (for example, larger reclining seats).
• Rail Europe says the France Rail Pass is the best option for non-European residents. It provides unlimited travel on the 31,000km national rail network, for three to nine days' travel within a one-month period. Regular France Rail Passes start at $263 for a three-day pass and $340 for a five-day pass.
• Rail Europe also offers a France Rail Pass Premium, which includes access to a private concierge to help with planning your holiday. Once you book you receive an email with contact details. You can use the concierge service for the whole time your pass is valid. Prices start from $300 for a three-day pass and $375 for a five-day pass.
• Most train stations have good facilities. The only hiccup we had was at Clermont-Ferrand, when we had to navigate stairs to get to our van driver. Taxis were on the same level as the rail platform.
• Take a book or work on your laptop (there's no internet on the trains, however), but don't forget to enjoy the postcard-perfect countryside.
• The TGV has a food car but the regional trains do not.
It was while waiting to board a TER at Moulins that I enjoyed my second croque monsieur, from a cafe opposite the station.
I plan to make a croque monsieur for my friends and family, impressing them with my knowledge of a French recipe before unveiling ... a ham and cheese grilled sandwich, topped with some bechamel sauce.

Mother
The parents of an 18-month-old baby girl - diagnosed with a-one-in-a-million cancer - have taken her journey to Facebook.
Since Mia Fletcher's liver cancer diagnosis in September, strangers have been able to track the brave little girl's progress on a special Facebook page, created by her parents Jason and Jodi.
Doctors say there's a tumour the size of a grapefruit on little Mia's liver.
"It's bad enough if an adult gets cancer, but a baby, that's really hard," Mia's dad Jason told Seven News reporter Karen O'Sullivan
"She hasn't even had a chance to get outside and play yet and she's got this cursed thing. It's just terrible."
While chemotherapy has shrunk the 14-centimentre tumour, it's too dangerous to remove, and now more tumours on her lungs are being treated.
The response to Mia's cancer journey has been overwhelming for her family, and they intend on keeping her followers updated in the coming weeks and months.
"You've got more people coming forward that you don't know, than people you do know," Jason said.
"You wouldn't think people care, but they do," Mia's mum Jodi added.
Mia's cancer journey documented on Facebook. Photo: Facebook
With only one in a million children diagnosed with this type of cancer, Mia has a long journey to recovery.
"She's hanging in there, we're all trying our best to get her through this," Royal Children's Hospital Oncologist Dr Martin Campbell said.
"She's a little trooper," Jason added.
Mia is expected to spend Christmas at the Royal Children's Hospital.
"I am praying so hard that this works, thank you for all your support and well wishes, kisses from Mia," her Facebook status reads.

ARLINGTON, Texas, Nov. 13, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- After 60 years of delivering TheSmith5Keys® as the most effective on-road driver training program in the industry, Smith System introduces KeySix, an important new product that will maximize driver safety management. KeySix will translate real time comprehensive driver safety information into actionable data in one place utilizing a secure cloud-based system.
Think about all of the elements involved in driver safety management. From MVR records, to driving histories to driver training and learning management systems, companies typically manage driver data through a series of disconnected spreadsheets. Managers spend hours collecting driver data and recording observations on driver behavior, but are often still hindered in their efforts to implement actions that can lower their fleets' risks and costs. Imagine having a cloud-based program that automates the collection of driver data while also placing driver-specific resolution steps at the fingertips of the driver managers. That program is KeySix(SM) from Smith System.
"KeySix(SM) automates data collection and establishes a one-stop location for all of your driver safety management actions," said Tony Douglas, CEO of Smith System. "Our customers have long depended on us to continually develop new ways to make their driver training programs more effective. We think KeySix(SM) is a revolutionary advance in helping them do what they do even better."
For a preview of KeySix(SM) and to learn more go to, call Smith System directly at 800-777-7648, or email us at keysix@drivedifferent.com.

Our intrepid reporter, the ever-industrious Campus Carl was dispatched to the Cougar football practice field to cover Wazzu's second scrimmage of the fall session. We have confiscated his notes before they fell into the hands of impressionable youngsters or Wisconsin cheese spies making googly eyes at the Cougar Gold
QB Alex Brink was the only one that really showed much consistency. Once again it took him a possession or two to get going, but once he did he was pretty sharp. There were some poorly thrown balls, but no stupidly thrown balls (meaning a few inaccurate passes to open receivers, but no reckless attempts to squeeze the ball between three defenders). Gary Rogers also started poorly, sailing his first three passes over the heads of his receivers. Over time he got a little sharper, but he was also the victim of some dropped passes, hence the 4-12 showing. Cole Morgan and Marshall Lobbestael each directed a touchdown drive but didn't get a lot of reps, splitting time on the 3rd team offense. Morgan had to deal with a couple of busted plays and eat the ball, but at least he didn't turn it over. ...More... To continue reading this article you must be a member. Sign Up Now for a FREE Trial

Protestors occupy Sandringham house – campaigning against its sale
Press Release – Vanessa Cole
Protesters occupied a house in Sandringham last night in protest against the selling of two state homes (94 and 96 Haverstack Road), set to be auctioned off this morning at 4 Viaduct Harbour Ave.
State homes are an essential asset to Aotearoa and provide families with shelter and life chances.
This occupation represents the reclaiming of public housing, which is being sold off around New Zealand to private developers, with little solutions to solve the housing crisis. The selling of state homes uproots communities.
Trouble will continue for those that are involved in the selling of state housing.
Supporters are encouraged to come out and support the protestors during the auctioning of the houses this morning at 4 Viaduct Harbour Ave.

I toutoko all of what has been said by Vanessa, this is our reality, and this is how it is going to be for many of us. That are going to end up in similar situations; no house no home – last resort what ever HSNZ has is what will be given to the minorities. Human rights being trampled on, families being placed in emergency concrete boxes that are looking more like a concentration camp. When I walk past and see what I see; these concrete units or high rises with families squashed in them and little children have no room whatsoever to run around or play in.

As part of an ambitious development programme, the University of Adelaide wanted to create a world class facility to attract and retain students in the areas of mathematics, computer science and engineering.
Aurecon was engaged to provide coordinated specialist structural glazing facades, as well as structural and civil engineering services from concept to project completion.
Our team played a leading role in value management workshops during the design phase, offering real savings options while maintaining the project’s overall aesthetic and quality.
We provided advanced analysis and design of ETFE (Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) roof trusses above the exhibition area, finite element analysis of cantilevered steel stairs and high order analysis for profiled concrete beams within the floor structure.
Our specialist structural glass group provided full design and documentation for the glazing package, including structural glass for the exhibition space’s entry structures, glass floors in the winter gardens and curtain wall framing.
An innovative diaphragm wall construction minimised disruption to the existing adjacent services, provided a water-tight basement and maintained the tight construction programme.
A stormwater collection system was designed to harvest roof water, with seven large thermal chimneys providing natural ventilation.
Various monitoring devices were also developed and installed throughout the structure, which allows the building itself to be used as a teaching tool.
Aurecon produced a world class building that exceeded the client’s requirements and has been warmly received by staff and students.
Our environmentally sustainable design (ESD) achieved Australia's first six star Green Star rating for an educational facility from the Green Building Council of Australia.
In 2011, Aurecon was recognised for its design of the building with a certificate of recognition in the Building (non-residential) category from Consult Australia and a commendation in the Buildings and Structures category by Engineers Australia's South Australia Division.

Dr. Shaddock is a Genius....... I highly recommend Dr. Shaddock for his chiropractic expertise. I injured my left knee and lower back snowboarding and have dealt with severe pain for three years. After seeing many doctors that could not help subdue the pain, without surgery, I was referred to Dr. Shaddock. After just several weeks of therapy, the constant pain started to subside and the everyday activities that have been next to impossible and painful, have become more than possible and the pain is a lot less frequent. I can enjoy my daily activities and activities of my children with ease and enjoyment unlike before. Everyone in the office was professional and guarantee quality care for all. It has been three and a half months now and I'm back to living everyday relatively pain free and am back to working out at a gym, with caution of course, I joined a month ago. I will continue to see Dr. Shaddock not only for therapy for my injuries, but also for alignments and anything else that can possibly be treated. THANK U!
Fantastic!!. I have been a dental hygenist for 22 years and due to this I have constant back pain. I have heard wonderful things about Dr. Shaddock therefore I made an appointment for today. I couldn't believe how much better I felt after just one visit. I plan on going back as much as I can (I would go everyday if I could). I highly recommend this practice, it was a wonderful experience from the moment I walked in the door to the moment I left.
Ok experience. My experience was good but I think I'll keep looking. I had a previous back injury and had visited other chiropractors and it seemed similar.
Best Chiropractor In Austin!. I have found very few chiropractors that are at the same level as Dr. Shaddock. Not just from a professional standpoint but from a personal level as well. Dr. Shaddock is just a great person in general, but he also knows his stuff. If you are looking for a chirorpactor who will take time to listen, won't high pressure you, and will actually help you with your problems, Dr. Shaddock is your man. Seriously, let this guy help you-he is awesome!
Best Chiro in Texas!. Dr. Shaddock is the best! I drive several hours to get to his office and its totally worth the drive. I have seen other chiropractors before and he is the best at explaining in terms i understand and making feel like a way better than i walked in. I am a runner/weekend athlete and Dr. Shaddock help make me aware of things I can do at home and in his office to optimize my quality of life. The scheduling is easy and the price is right. Better make an appointment now before he is all booked up.
What a pleasant surprise!. I recently injured myself while training for a marathon, so I was referred to Dr. Shaddock last week. To be honest, I have never went to a chiropractor before, so I was a little nervous. All I can say is hats off to Dr. Shaddock for being such a great Doc! He took the time to listen to every thing I had to tell him and put together a treatment specific to my injury. I guess the best thing about this clinic is the deep tissue massage and how thorough he was in explaining my injury in terms I could actually understand. I will definately be a long time patient of Oak Hill Chiropractic. Thank you!

Microsoft finally releases Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7, download it now
Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) has been available for Windows 8 since the OS launch, but Windows 7 users were stuck with IE9 until now. This morning Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7, which brings forth greater support for HTML5, improved speed and better privacy protection for users.
IE10 is said to be about 20% faster than its predecessor IE9, and utilizes DirectX 11 for the browser's graphics hardware acceleration speed-ups. HTML5 support is improved by more than 60% bringing forth a wealth of new feature rich web elements that developers will be sure to take advantage of.
Another feature worth noting is that Do Not Track is enabled by default. This feature blocks certain sites from tracking your browsing habits, such as Google who uses your browsing history to serve up targeted ads. Users must be running Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 installed in order to install Internet Explorer 10. You can download IE10 from the source link below.
How do you feel about the new IE10? Let us know in the comments.

YOUNG actor Angus McLaren is maturing faster than his magical mermaid co-stars grow their tails.
The 20-year-old star, who has been in the film and television industry for almost a decade, yesterday announced he would be leaving the Gold Coast-based H20: Just Add Water teen drama to focus on developing his 'grown-up' character in Channel Seven's Australian comedy-drama Packed To The Rafters.
The cast and crew were yesterday filming Jonathan M. Shiff Productions' third series of H20: Just Add Water at Warner Roadshow Studios at Oxenford.
The series is about three teenage girls with magical powers who turn into mermaids if they come into contact with water.
McLaren has played the awkward teenager and science nerd Lewis for the past 65 episodes of the highly successful drama series.
In Packed To The Rafters, McLaren plays Nathan Rafter who is married, has responsibilities and loads of family expectations.
"As I'm growing up, the work I'm doing is being aimed at an older audience, it's a natural progression," he said.
McLaren began filming the first series of Packed To The Rafters in between the H20 series. McLaren leaves for Sydney this week.
"It's really sad, it dawned on me yesterday that it was my last Monday on H20 and now it's my last Tuesday — we've all become close," he said.
"I'm going to miss the Gold Coast."

In another blow to the company's long-standing reputation for quality, Toyota said that they would announce another recall today, spanning some 2.3 million cars for problems with sticking accelerator pedals.
The January 2010 recall includes the 2009-2010 RAV4, the 2009-2010 Corolla, the 2009-2010 Matrix, the 2005-2010 Avalon, the 2007-2010 Camry, the 2010 Highlander, the 2007-2010 Tundra and the 2008-2010 Sequioia. Toyota noted that the recall does not include the Prius or any of the Lexus or Scion brands, which use a pedal system from a different manufacturer.
The company was quick to note that this is actually a separate recall from the late 2009 recall involving 4.3 million vehicles for incorrect floor mats. This issue is related to the pedal system itself, which can become worn down and can become "sticky over time," according to company spokesman Brian Lyons.

Honda Replaces IMA Hybrid Technology with New Sport Hybrid Systems
More than a decade later, Honda continues to use IMA technology in its hybrid vehicles. Such systems, which cannot propel the vehicle on electricity alone, are known as mild hybrids. A full-hybrid vehicle has a gasoline electric hybrid powertrain that can operate solely on the electricity stored in the battery pack for short distances and at lower vehicle speeds.
However, this is about to change with the 2014 Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid that arrives in January 2013. As part of the company's Earth Dreams engine initiative, Honda is introducing a new lineup of Sport Hybrid powertrains for its hybrid-powered vehicles, and confirms that the two more popular systems will offer full-hybrid, EV driving capability.
Sport Hybrid Intelligent Dual-Clutch Drive
This new full-hybrid powertrain, which was announced on November 12, utilizes a new Earth Dreams 1.5-liter, Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine, 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT), single electric assist motor, and a Lithium-ion battery. Honda says that with this new hybrid powertrain, "the fun of driving is realized with acceleration g-force more powerful than that of existing models as well as a rhythmic and linear acceleration feeling." The automaker also says the EV driving mode is operational at vehicle start-up and when cruising at low-to-moderate speeds.
Sport Hybrid Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive
This is the new full-hybrid powertrain installed in the 2014 Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid. The model is equipped with a new Earth Dreams 2.0-liter, Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine, continuously variable transmission (CVT), two electric assist motors, and a Lithium-ion battery. The system automatically engages one of three driving modes, depending on how the vehicle is driven and the battery's state of charge: EV Drive, Hybrid Drive, and Engine Drive.
In the Accord, this Sport Hybrid system is a plug-in hybrid, with a battery that offers pure electric driving for shorter trips. When the battery reaches a minimum state of charge, the system engages the gasoline engine and the vehicle operates as a conventional gasoline electric hybrid.
Sport Hybrid SH-AWD
Introduced in the Acura NSX Concept and destined for the redesigned 2014 Acura RLX luxury sedan, the new Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system pairs a direct-injection V-6 engine with a 7-speed DCT, three electric motors, and a Lithium-ion battery. One electric assist motor is contained within the transmission itself and directs power to the front and rear wheels. Two additional electric assist motors are located at the rear of the vehicle, controlling torque distribution to the rear wheels for a performance-oriented driving experience, according to Honda.

Notably, audio, communications and climate control features and their infamous myriad of buttons have been replaced by CUE, short for Cadillac User Experience, a new infotainment system which promises to turn the next generation of Cadillacs into giant rolling iPads.
First shown earlier this year at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, CUE gives drivers a new way to interact with their vehicles. Cadillac claims the system will make connectivity easier and it can reduce driver distraction by allowing the driver to use voice commands to control the system. CUE will come standard on the 2013 SRX.
With CUE, users can pair their Bluetooth-enabled phones and plug in multiple USB devices, MP3 players and SD cards. A hidden cubby offers storage for the mobile phone, which we suppose is more to keep the driver from reaching for it while on the road than to keep it safe from break-ins.
A huge, 8-inch touchscreen in the center stack serves as the CUE command center and displays music, navigation and other information. The screen uses proximity sensing and haptic feedback, so it can detect when the user's hand is close and adjust menu items accordingly. CUE lets you pinch, swipe, and use other hand motions we've been trained to do by smartphones and tablets. The system also uses voice recognition, so many functions can be performed without lifting a finger off the wheel or taking eyes off the road.
On-trend with other automakers, Cadillac is piling a plethora of electronic driver aids into the 2013 SRX, including lane departure warning, rear cross traffic alert, automatic front and rear braking and adaptive cruise control. These systems can alert the driver to potential hazards.
Other interior updates on the 2013 Cadillac SRX include a new shifter and a new steering wheel.
On the outside, you'll be hard-pressed to spot the differences on the refreshed 2013 Cadillac SRX. The upper and lower front grilles have been changed, and, like just about every other new car these days, LED lighting has been integrated into the front fascia. Three new exterior colors also make their debut: Evolution Green Metallic, Glacier Blue Metallic and Silver Coast Metallic. A new 20-inch wheel design is also available.
All models will continue to use a 3.6-liter V6 with direct injection that makes 308 horsepower and 265 pound-feet of torque. SRX is available with front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive.
The 2013 Cadillac SRX will go on sale in the fall of 2012. Pricing has not yet been announced, but we anticipate it will start at around $37,000.

There are many types of allergens; therefore, it is nearly impossible to eliminate all allergens from your environment. But there are certain things you can do to help reduce allergens and minimize your exposure to allergy triggers. Still, while avoiding the allergens may eliminate your symptoms, it will not eliminate or reduce your sensitivity to that allergen, and symptoms will reoccur whenever you are re-exposed.
- Control dust mites.
- Control animal dander.
- Control pests.
- Control indoor molds.
- Avoid airborne irritants.
- Keep environments clean and dry.
- Decrease exposure to outdoor allergens.
The primary indoor allergens are waste products from microscopic organisms called dust mites. Dust mites are especially prevalent in bedding, curtains, and carpeting.
To control dust mites:
- Wash sheets and blankets weekly in hot water (130°F [54°C]) and dry in a hot dryer.
- Cover mattresses and pillowcases with airtight allergen-proof covers.
- Replace comforters and pillows made from natural materials (such as down, feathers, or cotton) with those made from synthetic fibers.
- Avoid wall-to-wall carpeting (especially in the bedroom) as much as possible. If you have it, be sure to vacuum often.
It is not animal fur that causes allergies, but a protein that exists in the saliva, urine, and skin flakes (dander) of animals. If you have a pet allergy, you may need to take certain steps to minimize contact with your pet's saliva, urine, and skin flakes.
- Keep your pet out of the rooms you use most frequently (such as the bedroom).
- Have other nonallergic family members groom your pet as often as possible.
Be aware that you may have to remove your pet from your home if you or a family member is severely allergic.
Studies have shown that people who live in environments that contain cockroaches and mice have a higher incidence of asthma and allergies. If pests are a chronic problem in your home consider hiring an exterminator.
Other tips to diminish pest infestation include:
- Close all open gaps in windows, floorboards, doors, and around drains.
- Fix and seal leaky water faucets and pipes because roaches need water and humidity to survive.
- Always keep food in airtight containers.
- Remove pet food dishes after pets have eaten.
- Keep stove and kitchen surfaces free of food and dirt.
The spores of molds and fungi that thrive in warm, moist, and humid areas can create allergic reactions. To reduce indoor molds and fungi:
- Remove any curtains, carpeting, or wallpaper that show visible evidence of mold.
- Install exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom.
- Use dehumidifiers in damp areas such as the basement.
- Avoid storing clothing in damp areas.
- Do not carpet damp or concrete floors.
- Use a solution of 1 part bleach and 20 parts water to clean areas with mold.
Air irritants and pollutants can trigger an allergic reaction. You can do the following to help reduce your exposure to airborne irritants:
- Do not smoke or allow smoking in your home.
- Avoid areas with fresh paint fumes.
- Avoid the fumes of strong cleaning products.
- Avoid perfumes and aerosols when possible.
Nearly all allergens thrive in moist, damp, or dirty environments. One of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of allergic rhinitis is to maintain a clean, dry environment. The following will help:
- Clean and vacuum frequently, using HEPA filters.
- Use fans to promote air circulation.
- Use an electrostatic air purifier.
- Use a dehumidifier in damp areas.
If you have allergies to pollens, molds, or other outdoor allergens:
- Avoid raking, mowing, blowing leaves, and other outdoor activities that might put you in contact with allergens.
- Gardening and farming are associated with high levels of exposure to molds. You may need to stop doing these activities.
- Close windows and stay indoors (with air conditioning) when pollen counts are high.
- Time your outdoor recreational activities (hiking, bicycling, camping) for when pollen counts are lower.
If your symptoms are not controlled or become severe despite lifestyle changes and over-the-counter allergy medicines, contact your doctor for further care.

I am deeply disappointed that this is not about the magic of the park of the same name in the middle of the Detroit River.
As first I didn't think I was gonna like it, but as the trailer went on, I started liking it.
Nice to see Kenan Thompson get a (light) dramatic role, and I really did like Reiner's previous film (Flipped) a lot.

Not surprisingly, it has also been a record year for small business failures. Although it is impossible to document the exact number, we know that T'bird entrepreneurs are plentiful and diverse. Some people estimate that as many as one out of every four Thunderbird alumni are involved in entrepreneurial pursuits, according to Dr. Clifton B. Cox, Chairman of the World Business Department. With that in mind, Thunderbird Magazine sampled some successful Tbird entrepreneurs to hear their stories and discover how and why they chose to blaze their own trails. The account that follows may be of interest to alumni considering a transition into the risky but appealing world of the entrepreneur. Twenty men and two women responded to a series of questions on their background and professional pursuits posed to them lryThunderbird Magazine Seven of them operate businesses 2 abroad, while many more are based in the U.S. but do a great deal of their work in the international marketplace. All of them are die-hard entrepreneurs who can't imagine workingfor someone else again. Get the Training Of the twenty-two alumni sharing their experiences and inSights, nineteen said they had concentrated on marketing courses while at Thunderbird. The other three said their focus had been general management as well as accounting and finance, and at least one of them has felt a need for more marketing coursework. Christine Wilfer 76, President of Elite Services International, Inc., said "~ concentrated on finance and accounting, but my experience since graduation has been almost exclUSively in accounting and general management. I'm really sorry I didn't take more marketing at Thunderbird~' Armed with their Thunderbird degree and a heavy dose of marketing, these future entrepreneurs all joined other companies after graduation. Many went through extensive and valuable training programs with the likes of Colgate-Palmolive, Chrysler, J.I. Case, and Ford Motor. All of them maintain that their professional training with other companies was critical to the success of setting up their own businesses. "Learn on their time and money," said Jerome Firsty '57, President of Firbeck Inc., a firm of manufacturing representatives for school and office supplies. Firsty worked for Avon, Continental Can, and Hazel Bishop prior to setting out on his own. Take the Plunge But had they all planned someday to foresake the big corporate world to chart their own course? Interestingly, only half said they knew from the outset that one day they wanted to run their own show. Many felt like Dennis Oshiro 72 who says, "Originally, it was my intention to remain in a large organization to prOVide security for my wife and two children~' Oshiro, who runs a professional consulting firm, International Business Resources, Inc., decided in the end, that he could better proVide for the needs of his family on his own. Stephen Hall '69, President of Food Marketing International, Inc., decided to become an entrepreneur while attending Thunderbird. For many others, however, the transition to the entrepreneurial world was accompanied by a major transition in their personal lives: divorce, children growing "Lee Importers Ltd. gave me the opportunity to travel all over the world to do bUSiness-Japan, Formosa, Hong Kong, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, the Caribbean and China. This could never have been possible without establishing my own company" George Lee '58 President Lee Importers, Ltd. THUNDERBIRD MAGAZINE WINTER '84/'85 up, death in the family, loss of job. Others fOUli.d the frustration with corporate red tape and in-house politics, along with the allure of greener pastures, was enough to make them take the leap. Donald Schroeder '57, who in 1983 sold his tractor company to J,I. Case (Tenneco) remembers, "I had not planned on starting my own business, but I got tired of making millionaires in various countries and I thought I'd try it myself~' Many of the Tbirds we talked to like Charles Shields 71, President of Shields Corporations, were inspired by the success of others. "I always wanted to go out on my own, and after seeing the successes of German, French, English and Swedish entrepreneurs and working for them, I was convinced I could do it too~' This kind of conviction and confidence was a critical factor for each of the alumni interviewed. GeraldMirkin '47, President of Mirkin Motor Sales, remembers the choice of going out on his own related to two factors: lithe desire to provide well for my wife and children and the confidence I could do well on my own~' As all of these entrepreneurs will testify, if you don't believe in yourself and your project, you're doomed from the start. Enjoy the Rewards Once the transition is made, the advantages of being your own boss become very evident. Lianne Sorkin 72, President of Sorkin Associates, an independent business consulting firm in New York, sees the advantages very dearly after a number of years with Metropolitan Life Insurance. She sees it as lithe flexibility to choose your work and chart your own career path~' john G. Hoyt '56, takes a practical view of the advantages, which for him as President of Freedom Yachts in Newport, Rhode Island, means lithe ability to quickly translate ideas into products~' Many of his fellow Tbird entrepreneurs echoed the sentiment that personal creativity is no longer stifled by corporate red tape. When asked directly about the advantages of being their own boss, the THUNDERBIRD MAGAZINE WINTER '84/'85 James Kohl, President of ETEK Electronics Corporation, reviews a shipment for Brazil. Says Kohl, "The ability to create an organization to serve customers in the manner I believe in ... gives great satisfaction. word "freedom" was used most often to describe the positive factors of entrepreneurship. For Charles Muse '50, President of Intergraphic, Inc. in Panama, it's the "freedom to dream and experirnent:' For William Pennel '64, President of Intercontinental Motors in Houston, it's the "freedom of operations~' And for Donald Schroeder '57, retired President of Frontier Tractor, it's the "freedom to put your ideas into motion~' john]. Madison '67, President ofJohnJ. Madison Inc. in California, says it's the "freedom to explore other avenues of interest, Christine Wilfer '76, President of Elite Services International, Inc., didn't meet success the first time out. "My first venture ... was a consulting firm based in Fairbanks. Admittedly not having done my market research, the business was very short-lived; most of these people had gone to Alaska to do their own thing and were not about to listen to anybody else tell them how to run their show!" personally and professionally' And james Stanley '53, President of Fuertejidos, S.A. in San Jose, Costa Rica thrives on the "freedom of schedule and lifestyle~' Accept the Challenges Diego Veitia '66, President ofInternational Assets Advisory Corporation in Winter Park, Florida agrees with Stanley, but says the "advantage is sometimes paradoxical, for even though there is individual time available, those of us who run our own companies seldom exercise such options~' Veitia 3 "When my first big client delayed paying his bill almost two months because of his cash flow problems, I was left with less than 30 percent of my working capital, and feeling the spectre of impending doom:' Gregor]. Hargrett '68 President Overseas Duty Free Supply Corp. maintains that most successful entrepreneurs "are tougher on themselves than others would be on them had they remained in corporate structure:' The problem that Veitia alludes to was identified as the "buck stops here" syndrome, by Harriet Weaver, wife of the late Jesse 0. Weaver '58. The Weavers spent more than 30 years in Paraguay; most of the time operating their own businesses, and they have enjoyed the advantages as well as Peter R Cozzetto '52, President of CESCO Export, Inc., stands with diesel generating sets ready borne the burdens. for export to Venezuela. Says Cozzetto, "Most important, I believe, is the satisfaction of embarking As Stephen Hall puts it, lithe tyranny on a program for introduction of a new product and watch it bear fruit, all based on your own is that the job is always there:' More planning!' specifically; Gregor Hargrett '68, 4 Lianne Sorkin '72, President of Sorkin Associates, came to campus last December to speak about "International Entrepreneurship!' William O. Pennel,Jr. '64, President ofIntercontinental Motors, Inc., in Houston is a diehard entrepreneur who had always planned to go out on his own. Says Pennel, "Spending eleven years with large corporations proved I was right from the start!' President of Overseas Duty Free Supply Diego J. Veitia '66, President oflnternational Assets Advisory Corporation in Winter Park, Florida, looks at the sometimes rocky road of the entrepreneur with a philosophical and yet humorous edge. Says Veitia, "Some of our experiences have been difficult, but we have been able to learn from them. Like Nietzsche said, 'Any experience that doesn't kill you, makes you a better man!" in Miami, Florida, identifies it as lithe devotion, actually overdevotion, to serving clients well. In a small company; everything becomes very personal and so you work very hard to keep clients satisfied. It tires:' There are, of course, other disadvantages, not the least of them being financial. Paul Donnelly '67, is involved in several entrepreneurial pursuits in Caracas, Venezuela. He says he has experienced several failures as an independent businessman and has found that lithe biggest disadvantage THUNDERBIRD MAGAZINE WINTER '84/'85 is the lack of working capital to continue operations without too much internal turbulence:' Peter R. Cozzetto '52, President of C~sco Export, Inc., says simply "you have to prepare for the feast and famine cycle:' According to John Madison, "One of the biggest disadvantages is having to secure your company's business loans through your personal assets. Commerical banks make it a practice of requiring, from the owners of closely held corporations, continual guarantees:' For some, the right "timing" minimized some of the disadvantages. James Kohl 71, President ofETEK Electronics Corporation, was one who found the right time critical in his move. "Timing was very important both personally, because I was ready to return to the U.S., and economically, since the explosive growth of Latin American high-tech industries was demanding qualified electronics exporters in the US' According to Christy Peake '79, President of Robot Defense Systems, Inc., timing is also a crucial factor in his industry. "Most of the major defense contractors are only now developing plans ... By being small, focused, and pragmatic, we have hardware available where most companies have only ideas:' Deal with Disaster Although all are successful now, that doesn't mean these Tbirds didn't struggle and make mistakes along the way. Surviving the early years for most, was very, very difficult. After that, shifts in the economy, and sometimes changes in the political climate of the foreign countries in which they were based, had a serious impact on operations. In 1969, for example, George Lee '58, President of Lee Importers, Ltd., found "In January 1983, Fujitsu sent me to Japan to teach them how to automate their electronic interconnect operations!! An American teaching the Japanese about automation and electronics!!"

Stephen Hall '69, President of Food Marketing International, Inc., at Boston Harbor toasting the arrival of a large shipment of tea from England. himself in dire straits. His company purchased a building to develop a much larger undertaking than had been anticipated. The bank called the loan and Lee Importers almost went bankrupt. According to Lee, the experience was a terrific learning opportunity. He took drastic steps. By reducing staff from thirty to four and closing three branch offices, the situation turned around within a year. Potential disaster struck Peter Cozzetto in the form of a trumped-up lawsuit filed against his company in Saudi "I've seen too many decisions awarded for fancy footwork in the ring of the large corporate executive suite. I prefer a flatfooted stance in the arena of individual entrepreneurship, where only the blows that connect count, wins inspire, and losses don't embitter.' Charles Muse '50 President Intergraphic, Inc. Arabia for "non-delivery' He was held in Saudi Arabia for thirty days before he was permitted to return home and prepare the company's defense. They proved their innocence with nothing more than signed delivery receipts, but the incident cost them thousands of dollars. Ronald PfafJlin 73, Partner in Phoenix Pacific Incorporated, remembers that the early days for his company were very tough. "We put up a certain amount of cash and started 6 Gerald Mirkin '47, President of Mirkin Volkswagen in Hawthorne, California recommends in-depth knowledge and experience in the industry before doing it alone. After fourteen years managing a Chevrolet dealership, Mirkin says when he went out on his own, "There were no surprises!' before having all our finances secured. It made times very hard ... ~' Five years ago, however, his company won a contract bid to do a traffic control system for Seoul, Korea, beating out several other large corporations. Pfafflin's company is still the only recognized supplier in that city and, with the 1988 OlympiC games in Seoul, they expect to be very busy. You're on Your Own Nevertheless, when asked if they would do it all again, the answer is a resounding "Yes~' If anything, they would have started earlier. However, that's not to say they wouldn't do things differently. Stephen Hall says he would have become tougher earlier. "In some ways, business is war~' Likewise, Charles Muse says he would "prune out dead wood in personnel and chop off marginal operations much more quicklY.' Perhaps realism has colored some of the idealism of the early days. Clearly, experience has seasoned but not deterred these entrepreneurs. To some degree, they all share Dennis Oshiro's philosophy of survival. "I like to sink or swim on my own merits;' says Oshiro. "I am not afraid to make mistakes .... A mistake hurts, but it is not the end of the world. I do not expect to win all the time, just most of the time~' These Tbird entrepreneurs are doing just that in big businesses and small shops, alone or in groups, all over the world. Nancy Smith Nebeker Faculty Member Publishes Getting Your Yen's Worlh: How to Negotiate with japan, Inc. is a new book by Dr. Robert Moran, Professor of International Studies, published by Gulf Publishing Company. The cover of the book carries a warning, "This is not just another book about 'inscrutable' Japanese management. It is a success formula for going head to head with America's most competitive trading partner~' A reviewer for the Asian wall Street Journal stated that the book, "while aimed at Americans, contains tips that can be helpful for any international businessman .. .Its practical advice on how to negotiate effectively in Japan is extremely valuable. Dr. Moran's most practical tips appear in sections concerning 'ground rules' for and 'secrets' of successful negotiation. These deal with the importance of personal relationships, the need to gauge the degree of commitment expressed by the Japanese to a particular provision, the extreme cultural dissimilarity in what each culture perceives as 'acceptable' behavior and an understanding of the vertically structured interpersonal relationships in Japan:' Copies of the book may be ordered through the Thunderbird Bookstore. The price is $8.95 plus 15 percent for postage and handling within the U.S. Foreign orders will differ in cost; please inquire.

Here's hoping this year is better than last. 2012 was rough. There were good points, don't get me wrong, but between having to give up our home, losing our pup, economic issues, etc., it wasn't exactly a BANNER year. Granted, there are many who have it A LOT worse than we do, and we are incredibly lucky in so many ways. But here's hoping things improve for EVERYONE.
I can dream, can't I? :)
We got home yesterday afternoon from our Yosemite trip. It was sooooooo much fun! Other than having a tire blow out on the freeway on our way home. I was driving in the dark the night before and hit a big ol' pothole, which probably punctured the tire and caused a slow leak. Then we added all our stuff, then ourselves, and then it was just too much for the poor tire. Luckily we were less than an hour from home and have roadside assistance, so 2 lovely gentlemen showed up in a very timely manner to change the tire.
So right now the spare tire is on. I'll go in on Thursday to get a new tire and have them check out the car, make sure everything's OK.
But the trip was great. The kids went sledding and ice skating, and there was a little playground at the hotel. We had a nice room (at a VERY nice rate!), and the kids enjoyed it all. It was so good to get away for a couple of days, get the kids outside & playing in the snow. And, oh yes, to re-watch "Pride & Prejudice" (the Colin Firth version) on DirecTV in the hotel room.
Today I went to yoga, then came home so Hubby could go climb with his buddies. I'm not big on New Year's resolutions, but it seemed like a good way to kick of 2013. I'm also coming to realize the difference between dumping all over oneself and gently taking a good hard look inside, noticing the less-than-savory aspects, and working on changing them.
Hubby and I also noticed that the kids seemed to feel very secure in the hotel room. We talked about it, and we believe it's because, while not teeny-tiny, it was a contained space. The house we're in right now is pretty big: 3 floors, 5 bedrooms,4 bathrooms. Of course, there are 9 people (and 1 large, hyper dog) living here at the moment, so the space comes in handy. But WG sleeps a floor below us and keeping track of both of them can be tricky. Plus, we both honestly believe that when the kids know exactly where we are, it makes them feel more comfortable. Not that we're going to be drone parents (like helicopter parents, but worse), but giving them that sense of security IS important. And, of course, our knowing where they are and what they're up to can be important. Especially when they start Climbing On Things, or going into rooms THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN!!!!!!!!!
I know the dream is supposed to be to settle into a nice house, and "nice" often means "big." But we've lived in 2 houses and a townhouse on our own, and now share this house. Maybe the way to go, if we are ever able to do so, is to get a single-level home or even a condo. Maybe all that space isn't necessary. Maybe, just maybe, closer quarters will bring us closer together.
Or, y'know, result in a multiple murder/suicide.
We have dear friends who are quite well-off, financially. Yet they live, with their 2 kids, in the same apartment they've had for about 15 years, since before the kids were born. It's a beautiful place, with hardwood floors, in a great neighborhood. They don't own a TV, and they spend a lot of time together. And they're one of the most well-adjusted families you could ever meet!
If the past year has taught me anything, it's that my priorities are still a bit skewed. We don't need a ton of Stuff. We don't need a McMansion (although I never wanted one of those: they must be a bitch to clean!). Happiness isn't always what we think it'll be. I will never be perfect at my job, but neither does that mean I suck at it. There will always be things to learn and room for improvement.
If I want to stay happy, it is up to me. The fact is, I am QUITE happy and content right now. No, it's not an ideal situation, but what is? And even if a situation feels ideal, how long does the feeling last?
OK, one final note: Since I STILL cannot post links on my blog (that's on my list of Things To Learn How To Do this year), I am going to direct you to a post on Tumblr by the magnificent Louise Brealey: Actor, journalist, writer, feminist, and all-around person-I'd-like-to-be-if-I-ever-grow-up, even though she's, like, 20 years younger than I am. It's called On Yellow Paper, and the post is "What Molly Did Next:." (She plays Molly on "Sherlock.") She recently played 3 roles in an updated version of "Trojan Women," including Helen, and had to strip nude. It's a GREAT article!!!!!!!
OK. I'm out. Happy New Year, lovelies!

Happy new year to you too!
I hear ya about the "stuff". After going through our house a bit I've come to realise how much "stuff" we have that we really don't need...and am trying to, over the next year, do some more purging. Also a more careful selection of what comes into our home. We don't have the perfect house and sometimes I get angry that my friends have nicer, better things, but in the end...it doesn't matter. We live pretty well all things considered, and I am very grateful for my life. :)

jocelyn came upon me in mccabe while i was alternately looking forlornly at the last bit of cash money i have to my name ($1.45) and the pitiful selection of baked goods they sell at the mini-coffee bar here. i guess i shouldn't complain: already i've marveled that we ever got along w/o snacks sold in the library. joc didn't have any money but she volunteered to run back to willets to grab me a yogurt from her room. no one's eating them anyway, she promised me, and it was no trouble since somehow it was all in the right direction. too weak to argue, i let her go. she has since returned and the dannon has since revived me. i had a panicked few minutes there when i thought all my work this afternoon was lost (it isn't); now that my blood sugar has evened out, i'm feeling less on the brink.
today was all work and meetings. granted the meetings were enjoyable -- during the sclp one, we drank tea and brainstormed new names for our organization; during the Red Sky one, we made signs and listened to dar -- still, much running around, and the constant, patient breathing of a paper down my neck. must compose now. must be brilliant.
if there are any stray muses wandering around the internet, looking for occupation, i'd really appreciate some help. in return, o holy one, i pledge, we will name our group-formerly-known-as-sclp after you.

Let me start off by saying that i have been DVRMSToolbox since Windows XP Media Center Edition and have never had any problems seting it up to do commercial skipping. But i just recently upgraded to windows 7 (which so far has been great) and for the life of me cant get skipping to work. I am an Early access member and payed for showanalyser. I installed the latest early edition DVRMSToolbox - 1.2.2.0 (R2) and ShowAnalyser Version 1.0.52.760 and DTBAddin for Window 7 - 1.0.0.4 (R2).I followed this step by step, and it looks like everything installs correctly but i cant get the remote to turn off and on the commercial skip. Showanalyser shows the .WTV as being processed but still no skip.I love this software but i cant for the life of me get it to work with Windows 7. Can anyone help me out?Bert
I too have been a long term user of DVRMS and too have recently moved to Windows 7. the instructions at are somewhat outdated, but this is what I know so far.
I have installed, removed and downloaded and re-installed the DVRMSTToolbox and the ComSkip.
It appears to be marking commercials after the show is recorded.
in working with here are some of the results.
Lastly, I cannot find the ehexthost log or determine how to create it.
There are no errors that I can see, but the Com Skip on/off does not work, the skip ahead and back buttons do not work and in just watching thw show does commercials do not skip.
If anyone is willing I have the time, the knowledge and the desire to get this fixed today.
tony2003@runright.ca make sure you have the addin installed. It is a separate installer. Also, comskip cannot read wtv files yet. You must use Show Analyzer Version 1.0. That is unless you convert to dvrms first.
Okay here are the steps I took, and the results. Nothing worked - see last paragraph.
Uninstalled the DVRMSToolbox and the Show Analyzer (I know I thought it was the ComSkip)
Deleted the old DVRMSToolbox and Show Analyzer Directories
Downloaded a new copy of DVRMSToolbox1219
Followed your link and downloaded the Show Analyzer Suite
Installed and ran DVRMSToolbox1219 and did NOT allow the Show Analyzer be automatcially downloaded and installed
Installed and ran the Show Analyzer Suite and didn't like it.
downloaded ShowAnalyzer Latest version (0.9.7) from have already purchased the program...
Uninstalled the DVRMSToolbox and the Show Analyzer Suite
Installed and ran DVRMSToolbox1219 and did NOT allow the Show Analyzer be automatcially downloaded and installed (Right click run as administrator)
Installed the Show Analyzer (Right click run as administrator)
Started Media Center, went to a recorded show, I hoped the question to mark the commercials, or for skip forward/back buttons to work (They only bring up the Program Info), or for it to skip a commercial. no luck. Also discovered that the down arrow usually used to turn the Autoskip on and off, only produced the Windows mini tv guide.
Restarted computer, tried again ... no luck, got the same results. The part that gets me is the down arrow button used to turn the Autoskip off and on doesn't work...that should be a basic feature.
Looking over the instructions again and maybe it does have to be the Show Analyzer Suite. So uninstalled everything and did all the above with the Show Analyzer Suite...same results.
Windows 7 Pro 64 bit << all the lastest fixes and patchesIntel DG965WH Motherboard (latest BIOS), Intel Quad 2.4 Ghz CPU4 Gig Ram, 571 GB free of 931 GB Local Disk C: (Most space taken by recorded tv shows)Clean install on DEC 27, 2009
I still question that the basic on/off function does not work. Right now using the down arrow on the remote only brings up the program info (and yes I am testing this on a pre-recorded show). I have uninstalled everything again and am leaving it running with all the default settings that come with the DVRMSToolbox1219 and the ShowAnalyzer Latest version (0.9.7). I am open to any ideas.
the FAQ should read Vista/7. I will fix that.
You kind of lost me with that comment....Vista/7 ?? I am still waiting for my reply sent about 10 hours ago to appear on this site...
Tony
Okay, I thought I had kept a complete copy of what I sent previously...guess I didn't, here it is again in a nut shell
I have uninstalled DVRMSToolbox1219 and Show Analyzer (I know I said ComSkip before) and have gone and deleted any remaining files in the directory, did a restart and then installed the new software, using right click run as administrator, restarted again and tested.
I did this a few times, Installing DVRMSToolbox and a separate downloaded version of Show Analyzer, Show Analyzer Suite. In all cases (and just to narrow down things) after the install, and going to a recorded TV show, and pressing the down arrow on the remote, I expect a window saying the Auto-Skip is off or on and all I get is the program guide. The skip buttons also only give the the Program Info. From what I can figure out, everything is loaded and working in the backgroup. It looks like it marks the commercials after recording. It just doesn't work.... any more ideas?
Tony
Well you didn't mention the addin in the things you installed. My apoligies if you already have this, but this is a must for the functionality you are talking about.
No problems, ask any questions, I really like this program and am already really missing it. Okay back to add ons. In Windows MCE I have only downloaded and installed the DVRMSToolbox1219 and when it asked if it should, I let it install Show Analyzer Version 0.9.7. About the referenced DTB addin, I did not specifically download and install such a program, but in the task mananger I do see a DTBFWService.exe and a DTBService running. No other MCE add in's have been knowingly installed.
I have found, downloaded and installed DTBAddin for Window 7 - 1.0.0.4 (R2), it would not let me download the R3 version, now what?
Install the version corresponding to your system x86 or x64 and you should be good to go.
That definantly solved the problam...Thank You Very Much...
For those who skip to the bottom, a recap1) Downloaded and installed DVRMSToolbox1219 which came with Show Analyzer Version 0.9.7. It appeared the program was not working, the arrow keys on the remote that control it were not functioning and there was no skipping of commercials happening.
2) Solution downloaded DTBAddin for Window 7 - 1.0.0.4 R2 from and ran it.
3) Worked as before with asking if it should mark commercials with programs already recorded and it did mark them and the directional buttons worked correctly too!
4) Haven't tested the full gambit of functions yet, but as of now it is a lot better than before.
Thanks again
Here's the link.
If you purchased Show Analyzer before 1.0 was release you can retrieve your key for the new version here.
The version you have will not work.

Where is time going? I feel like she was just born yesterday and here we are, a month later. It's insane. She has had a really good day so far today *knock on wood*. I realize it's only 11:30am. We got up this morning and she had to have a bath because she pooped all over herself. She was smiling at me during her bath. It was so cute. After her bath we took some pictures of her and she didn't fuss one bit. AND she had the hiccups. Which usually make her freak out. Today's a good day! I bought these stickers you stick on a onesie each month and take pictures. It sounds silly but they are so cute! I bought them from. You can also find them on etsy.com and for some reason mine were about $5 cheaper on etsy than they were on the company's website.
1 month old!
With her presents!
Looks like she is doing the sprinkler!

I had been dreading talking to Elijah's daycare provider about the fact that he recently had a croup episode during an afternoon nap. I didn't want to scare her and I also didn't see a way to ensure he would be 100% safe if he had a croup episode away from home. I finally talked to her about it and within 24 hours she had gotten a used nebulizer from a friend and Dan and I had scrounged up some extra tubing/masks so she could have a second set of "croup supplies" at her house. Dan brought her a vial of our magic croup medication along with detailed instructions about how to handle an episode.
I feel a million times better! I am thankful that this didn't scare her, even when I told her how frightening and life-threatening his episodes can be. I am thankful that she IMMEDIATELY helped us to find a solution and that now she has what she needs at her home to help our little boy if he has an episode. I am thankful that MY peace was important to her and that I can breathe a little easier now. I am thankful that Elijah is such a loved, blessed little man!
It seems like I can't keep up with writing about all of the funny things Elijah has been doing lately. Yesterday I found some of the new baby's clothes (Elijah's old stuff) stuffed into the front of Elijah's shirt drawer in his bedroom. I guess he is trying to reclaim some of his old clothes??
Lately when Dan and I are chatting and Elijah wants to be a part of the conversation, he will say, "MAMA TALK!" In other words, I'M PATIENTLY WAITING FOR YOU TO STOP TALKING!
Last night we had cake and ice cream with a few family members to celebrate Dan's dad's birthday. Elijah was more eager than I've ever seen to get his hands on some cake and ice cream. He totally devoured it and asked for more ice cream FOUR times (he takes after his mommy!). Everyone thought the way he ate his ice cream was really funny. He picked it up like it was a cookie and took big bites out of it. :)
This week is really busy for me with work, so I have been working like crazy on my computer from the couch. Elijah doesn't have preschool this week (spring break) so he has been going to daycare and Dan is doing work for a friend. The weather has been BEAUTIFUL! Ahhh, this is what living in Minnesota is all about!

At the hearing, State Transportation Secretary Richard Davey outlined some aspects of Gov. Deval Patrick’s 10-year transportation budget plan, and included the need for new revenues.
The state transportation secretary answered legislators' questions regarding the Green Line Extension, the South Coast Rail project, MBTA infrastructure, maintenance issues and how an ambitious 10-year budget plan will handle all of it.
Massachusetts Department of Transportation Secretary and CEO Richard Davey testified before the Joint Committee on Transportation Tuesday morning. He was there to formally present Gov. Deval Patrick’s 21st Century Transportation Plan which calls for a $13 billion investment over the next decade. The hearing focused on finding new revenue that could be put toward ailing infrastructure and sought after rail projects.
“People want more, not less, of our product,” Davey began, “but the current system we have is one we can’t afford."
Patrick called for $1.9 billion tax increase in January to be put toward education and transportation.
Davey said Patrick’s ambitious plan is designed to accomplish three things: it will right MassDOT’s finances, it will end the “absurd” practice of funding highway projects by borrowing money and it will provide revenues to fund the regional transit authorities.
Michael Widner, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Association, said transportation would need to raise $800 million in revenues per year to get MBTA debt relief and to fund needed transportation-based services by 2018.
He said it would be impossible to raise the type of funds necessary to meet the goals set forth by the plan by raising income taxes, but it could be done through a combination of increased gas taxes, car registration renewal fees and inspection fees.
“The public will accept this if they see improvements,” he told the committee.
Davey, seeking support from the committee, said improvements have begun, but it will take more than “band aids” such as MBTA fare hikes and more borrowing to sustainably finance transportation in Massachusetts.
“We’ll pay for this now or we’ll pay for this later,” he said. “There’s no choice about whether we will pay for it.”

Comments on: 2013 Hyundai Genesis 2.0T / 3.8 R-Spec Coupe - Instrumented Test- Read story
More power and more Veloster nose.
They forgot to mention "Snarling goofy alien nose" as a "Low."
Sure it's improved, but this will never gain ground as a serious sports coupe as long as it looks like every other Hyundai.
Not too bad........but not too good.
Right on the cutting edge of.....mediocre!
BD
A for effort but a B- for execution. I personally think they are a bit over priced considering what else you can get in that price range.
Sorry, but I'm not aware of the RWD car with 270+ HP for under $28k
The Mustang has 300+ HP for $23k, and gets 31 MPG......
BD
BD, i generally agree with your comments but i have to side with the genesis over the mustang. u'd have to get the v6 premium with the performance package, over 30k, to come close to the tech the genesis provides standard for 2k less.
Maybe I am alone in this but I couldn't care less about how much "tech" my performance car has, I care about performance. And for the price it doesn't provide as much as I would hope for. On Tech front, it looks like the base 2.0T doesn't come with many more bells and whistles than any other car. The only things that stand out to me are the standard leather steering wheel, shift knob and bluetooth
I'll take the $5k I'd save with the Mustang and get an iPad, a Samsung GS3, wheels and tires, and a years worth of gas.
And I'd outperform any Hyundai 4-banging GC for years to come! And probably smoke the $30k V6 too!
BD
showcase -Incorrect my friend, you do not have to spend anywhere near 30K to get a Mustang that rivals the Genesis "Tech". Quit paying attention to MSRP. A brand new '13 V-6 Mustang with the Performance Pack and Premium trim can easily be had for less than $25K real-world. My 2012 Mustang GT/CS had an MSRP of almost $38K and I purchased it with almost no hassles for $30,200, $3K rebate from Ford and a no-hassle discount of $4400 from the dealer. This was in March 2012 and the deals are still similar for the '13s, only the rebate is currently $1500. My GT/CS has all of the regular GT Premium stuff along with the Boss front and rear clips and unique 19" wheels. Added a Ford SVT GT-500 axle back exhaust for only $300 myself and a set of 275/40-19 P-Zeros replaced the stock 245/45-19s out back. And as a bonus, only 2573 GT/CS were built in 2012, so if I keep it for 20 yrs it will have some collector value. Not sure about the Genesis......
when i was saying tech, i meant the lsd, rims, taller gearing, etc. the things that make it a sport car. a base 23k mustang doesnt have all that. i totaly agree on getting that v6 premium with the performance package if it can be had at 25k. i was looking at msrps, that's the only price i have to go on without considering each specific dealer's incentives
Performance and feel are what make a sports car a sports car. It doesn't matter how you go about it. The fact that the clutch and shifter are a pain make the Genesis less of a true sports car to me because it doesn't interface with the driver like a real sports car should. The lsd is the only thing that really matters tech wise, but you can get one for around $600 aftermarket. You can get nicer wheels (rims, whatever) too. I don't see how taller gearing makes it any sportier either. How often do you drive 150 mph, showcase? I'd say Tony is right. It's overpriced and it looks about the same (even worse to some) than the older ones, so it isn't going to be noticed as being improved by the general public even. I'm very picky when it comes to the feel of a sports car (as are most enthusiasts), and the older Genesis just didn't feel good to me, this one isn't that much different, so it probably won't drive any better. The Mustang I drove felt better to me. I couldn't buy a new Genesis personally as I know I would trade it in.
showcase0712 - ALL Mustangs come with an LSD standard - it's called the Traction-Lok rear axle, that's Ford's name for it, it's the same, beefy 8.8" rear diff they've been using forever and drag racers love it for it's durability, it's a good road race unit as well, though not as advanced as the Torsen diffs used in the Boss and GT-500. It's a very good standard unit and it uses Carbon Fiber friction plates/clutches. The Ford website specs are pretty sparse but if you go to the pdf spec brochure and open it you'll see very clearly that all Mustangs come with a standard limited-slip diff. They have for years. And also, to echo Brian H's comment, taller gearing is generally less desirable for performance unless you are making LOTs of HP and have terrible traction problems, not an issue with a 350HP Genesis by any means.
you should see what these look like after a good knock, there is a reason that car has hard points to lock onto when towing or pulling, not the best without question and with the wacks out there today , the key word is safety
It's in the middle of the pack. It's styling I think is a major question mark. And it could stand a tad more refinement. The look is what makes the car so conversational.
I wish manufactures were chasing the frs/brz or rx8 trend and not the 370z/mustang
Those are some nice power gains but the 1st gen looked better
$2000 higher? Wow. It makes me think about a base mustang coupe V6 with the 6 speed for $22k. Plus this car is ugly in the front. I like the last version better. I'll pass on this car.
makes no sense at all when the V6 mustang can be had in the really low 20k's and for the price of a V6 genesis a V8 mustang is the better choice, better looks more power and that's really all that matters in the sport coupe segment
They should stick with it. It is not my taste, but it has a market. They do need to work on the car's status though. The best cars in the world are the ones that create their own standards. Yes a 911 has many competitors, but in the end there is nothing like the 911. Certain Corvettes compete directly with the 911, but most Vette buyers will never consider 911. That is where the Genesis is failing, why should I buy this car?
I'm still unsure of Hyundai's power delivery. The turbo four makes 274 hp, 37 more than a Lancer Ralliart, but the latter does 60 in about 5.5 and the quarter in 14 flat, nearly half a second quicker on both aspects. I know that the Mitsubishi is 4WD, but once the RWD Genesis is done with its wheelspin, the times should have been similar as it supposedly still has a power advantage.
C/D's test of the RalliArt had it at 5.7 and 14.4@94 mph. This Gen 2.0T's numbers (5.9, 14.4@99 mph) don't prove that it's power numbers are inaccurate.
The 3.8's 1/4 mile run (13.8@104) is right on the heels of cars like the Hemi-powered Challenger R/T (13.6@106), Mitsu Evo (13.5@101), Nismo 370Z (13.7@105) and actually beats the likes of the WRX STI (13.9@99) and BMW 335 (13.8@103).
Not bad... and I think it shows up those who disparage "Hyundai-horsepower".
i'm one of those disparagers, and i'll continue to disparage it until they get real. i guess it depends on where you get your information. not sure where you got your numbers from but c&d ran a 335i at 13.4 with an automatic and all-seasons. so having summer tires, a manual, a stiffer suspension, and "48" more hp, the hyundai still trails by several tenths. same old story. also, the sti does it in 13.5 at 101, and C&D pulled a 13.6 in the standard 370z way back in january of 2009, and that car has 20hp less than the nismo.
All those numbers are from right here on caranddriver.com.
I'm sorry that you're the only person in the world that didn't know about BMW underrating their engines, too.
FYI, since you seem incapable of research: ... with a manual and summer tires, lol.
Also:
nice improvement. now stop inflating the hp numbers, and they may earn some street cred among enthusiasts
The V6 is as quick as a good running, stone stock 1970 Hemi Cuda. Attend a vintage "muscle car" event and see how well that dose of reality sits.
Not bad, Hyundai. Keep at it and eventually the Genesis Coupe might gain a little status in the Sportscar world.

Nabeel Rajab: imprisoned for tweets, paying the price for the struggle for freedom
Witness Bahrain interviewed human rights activist and Bahrain Center for Human Rights President Nabeel Rajab in Bahrain yesterday (July 9) just before he was taken to jail for a three-month sentence related to an update he posted on Twitter.
In the video, Rajab states: “I will not stop and I’m teaching people not to stop. If everybody will keep quiet after putting them in jail, then it’s a disaster. We should challenge that. We should be willing to pay the price for the struggle for the freedom that we fight for. And this is the price.”
Read the entire Witness for Bahrain blog post here.
The Bahrain Coordinating Committee supports the universal right to freedom of expression and calls for the immediate release of Nabeel Rajab.

Bahrain Activist Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja Ends Hunger Strike;
Bahrain Coordinating Committee Calls for Release
[Washington, DC] May 28, 2012 — The DC-based Bahrain Coordinating Committee applauds the sustained courage of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, the imprisoned human rights activist on trial for leading protests in Bahrain, who ended his 110-day hunger strike today, and calls for his unconditional release and the dismissal of all charges.
In a letter to his family, the activist stated the hunger strike served one of its purposes: to shed light on the ongoing human rights violations in Bahrain. Although he did not attain his freedom, the second objective of his hunger strike, he felt prison officials had made it clear to him that they would force feed him again if his health deteriorated.
Read the report on his letter to his family here, from Bahrain Center for Human Rights:
Khawaja commenced his hunger strike on February 8, 2012 to protest conditions of his detention, including abuse and torture while in custody. The activist was force-fed on with a naso-enteric tube in late April. The World Medical Association states that force-feeding is a form of inhumane and degrading treatment.
Khawaja, the co-founder of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, has been imprisoned for more than a year. He was arrested in April 2011 and sentenced to life in prison by the National Security Court in a martial law proceeding. The sentence was condemned by international human rights groups and several nations, and is being re-tried in the civil courts, along with the cases of twenty-one other activists.

The Bahrain Coordinating Committee is a Washington, DC-based grassroots movement that works to obtain U.S. support for democracy and human rights reforms in Bahrain. For more information, please visit

Remember the days when you went on holiday and spent evenings writing "Wish You Were Here" on postcards? Doesn't happen much these days - now we just Facebook "At the 12 Apostles" or msg "Good times on the road" but occasionally some sweet person, usually a fellow blogger, sends a postcard and it ends upon the fridge only further exacerbating my wonderlust. Alan Burnett at News From Nowhere has started a bit of a craze that's taken off all over the world. Twitter for Gentlefolk has seen a huge postcard exchange take place on the blogosphere and, well, bless his Yorkshire socks, he sent me one! Jeff and I returned the favour but God knows what he'll make of the drunken and badly written ramblings on the back of our cacky handed contribution (yep we're both left handed with awful handwriting), barely worth publishing . . . Unlike Alan's contribution to me which was far more genteel. Just wish I looked like the slim blonde!
Well it wasn't quite a motorcycle ride around the country but the Holden Cruze was a comfy ride. So nice to have friends 'across the water', all 12,000 miles of it! God, did I remember the air mail sticker or did I just write it on the back of the card?

nice. i must say this whole idea has saved the post card industry...sales are sky rocketing...buy stock now...
cool post card....
Oooh, that's a wonderful postcard! This swap is so fun, isn't it? Looking forward to when Alan receives yours! :)
What a fun idea! I am going to have to check out Twitter for Gentlefolk. Love Alan's postcard to you.
i haven't had a postcard in so long- used to belong to a club and we sent to one another post to post it was called
I must have had my head in the sand to miss this postcard revolution...I love getting them, and usually send a bunch when I'm on vacation. Love the idea of exchanging them with bloggers and posting.
Tina @ Life is Good
Love it! I have a vintage postcard collection that really should be shared.
I'm all for bringing paper postcards back to life. Have a blogging friend in the USA who collects postcards from all over the world, so she gave me her address and when I see a fun card, I send it to her.
The card you got is beautiful and lovingly written. Sweet ;-)
that's awesome...prolly got some laying around i should send out...
maybe next year
I love this! Alan is SO sweet and SUCH a great idea! It is SUCH a treat to receive something personal via snail mail. Doesn't happen enough!
I love this idea. I'm must go look. The postcard from Alan is so retro. Very cool.
The "hand" written word. What a lost concept! I still like to write letters but I so seldom do. Once upon a time, I would write in the neighborhood of 20 letters monthly. We always lived away from our home state, family and friends so I had many correspondents. I kept track of them in a writing log and I still have the months & # of ltrs. Still have the records. Wild, huh?

Beat oil and sugar together, and add the eggs one at a time. The dry ingredients go in next, followed by the fresh and drained dry fruits, lemon zest and nuts. Spoon the batter into the tin and cooki for at least 1 hour – I find it normal takes at least 15 minutes longer. Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack.

As the author of The Healing Powers of Olive Oil and The Healing Powers of Vinegar, gotta love this recipe! It’s the ingredients from the Mediterranean diet–super to keep you heart healthy, lean, and living a longer, happier life! So lucky to have lived in Tuscany. (I only write about it. So far. Will go one day.)

This sounds wonderful – going to try it out this weekend. I’m guessing you’d need to cook it in a solid base cake tin? Does it lift out quite easily?

Anne Moshier
Sanderson resident Anne Moshier fled Homestead, FL as a young girl to escape the wrath of Hurricane Andrew, which devastated the city and much of South Florida 20 years ago.
Last week on August 24, the anniversary of the hurricane’s landfill, Ms. Moshier updated her Facebook status to say, “Hurricane Andrew changed my life forever ...”
That day would have been her first day of 5th grade at South Dade Baptist Church and School. But the day before, she recalled this week, her parents, Terry and Howard Moshier, were in a frenzy.
Hurricane Andrew had reached Category 5 intensity and would become the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, that is until Hurricane Katrina hit some 15 years later in 2005.
But in the days leading up to impact, the hurricane was forecasted to make landfall further south, so the Moshiers, who lived in a sturdy home on the Homestead Air Force Base where her father was stationed, had not prepared.
“All the TVs in the house were on,” recalled Ms. Moshier, a Macclenny photographer. “The military police were on their loud speakers ordering everyone out. It was very surreal, like a bad dream. We started packing the truck with important papers, our pets and so forth. My dad was concerned about his Harley, so we brought it into the kitchen. I thought it was the funniest thing, but then again, I was a child and Daddy’s bike was never allowed inside.”
Ms. Moshier, 10 years old at the time, and her mother evacuated while her father stayed behind as ordered. Their destination: the home of her aunt, Wilda Heppner, in Sanderson. They slept in a spare room with her cousin’s toys.
“The traffic was insane in both directions, north and south. Truckers on the CB were talking about hurricane parties and I didn’t have a clue what that was at the time,” she said. “The rest areas and fast food chains were slammed with people evacuating and pulling over for a quick break before hitting the turnpike and highways again. It seemed to take forever to reach Sanderson, but I remember pulling in her driveway. From that point on, we stuck to the TV like glue.”
Meanwhile, her father, who now resides in Ohio, rode out the storm on the base with his colleagues. The building they were inside lost its roof and they moved to another location in the middle of the hurricane.
Ms. Moshier’s childhood home was one of the few structures to survive the hurricane. It had only partial damage to the roof. Her dad and other men stayed in the house for several days after Andrew hit with limited food and water and no power. She’s remembers seeing a video they shot of the aftermath.
“It looked like a train wreck; it reminded me of a third world country,” said Ms. Moshier. “Everything was water-soaked, leaves and junk were scattered throughout the house. It looked horrible and I couldn’t imagine how that was the best home to stay in. I finally had a tree house though, as a playhouse had ended up in a tree in our backyard.”
Since leaving Homestead for Baker County two decades ago, Ms. Moshier has never been back.
There was nothing to go back to, she said.
Her school was gone. The base, as they knew it, was lost. Her father was re-stationed to Virginia. Her best friend and her family ended up in South Carolina.
“A couple of years ago, I took a trip to the Keys. As we approached South Florida, I saw the exit signs for places I remembered, as well as signs for the base which is now used for veteran’s affairs. I held my breath as we drove by ...” Ms. Moshier said. “Maybe one day, I’ll go back.”
Though she was just a girl when the hurricane wreaked havoc across South Florida and forever changed her life and those of many others, Ms. Moshier has vivid memories of that time, including her first day at Keller Intermediate School where she would return years later as a substitute teacher.
“I don’t have fond memories of that school year. I can still remember the smell, the classrooms, the gym; everything. For years, those memories would make me nauseous. They were directly linked to Andrew and all that entailed,” she said.
With another hurricane, Isaac, heading toward the Gulf Coast and bringing with it the ghosts of Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Moshier said her best advice for hurricane preparedness is knowing when to evacuate.
“When the big one hits, you can’t stay. You just can’t,” she said.
Northeast Florida and Baker County in particular have been largely spared by the worst impacts from hurricanes. But that’s no reason to become complacent, according to Ms. Moshier.
“We get lots of rain, which causes horrible flooding, but we seem to skirt the worst ones, and thankfully so,” she said. “I’m not sugar coating anything though. We have as much possibility of welcoming an Andrew or Katrina as anyone else on the Atlantic or Gulf. We have been lucky.”
Keeping supplies of bottled water, flash lights and batteries should be standard operating procedure for all Floridians, she added.
“Don’t leave too early, don’t leave too late, but always be ready and willing to go. Your home, my home; no home or property is worth risking your life and no home is ‘hurricane code.’ That’s a joke — both Andrew and Katrina will testify to that,” said Ms. Moshier.
One more tip: always grab your photos before evacuating.
“That is one thing that brings me to tears whenever I see the aftermath of storms, fires, etc. on the news; when someone is sifting through what is left and finds a family photograph,” she said. “I don’t know why but that’s the saddest thing to me.”

Cool Springs Golf Reopens
The popular center closed suddenly in mid-March.
A drive by the Cool Springs Golf and Family Recreation Center on Hamilton Road in Bethel Park on Tuesday afternoon showed the center's miniature golf and upper driving range areas to be open for business. The lower range and batting cages were closed. The center closed suddenly in mid-March when Cool Springs senior management met with some employees to tell them they would close until—tentatively—mid-April. Bob Salera, the head professional and director of instruction at Cool Springs Golf School, said that that was the first time that Cool Springs had closed since he started working at the facility in 1997. Despite the reopening, Cool Springs' website——is out of service as of Wednesday morning. --- Sign up for…

Oh Really? NFL Baller Justin Durant Says He Would Still Eat ‘Chick-fil-A’s’ Chicken Even If They Supported Slavery! (Open Discussion)
On Wednesday, NFL Detroit Lions linebacker Justin Durant weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding Chick-fil-A and the restaurant owner’s public opposition to gay marriage.
The NFL baller ended up saying in so many words that he would still support Chick-fil-A (because of their tasty chicken sandwiches) even if they came out in support of slavery.
Durant took to his Twitter account yesterday and asked his followers “what happened with Chick-fil-A?”
As several replies came pouring in, Durant expressed his disbelief that there was any controversy at all.
He Tweeted:
“Chick-Fil-A not even open on Sunday how people shocked that the owner feels that way?”
He also questioned why people would let someone’s personal beliefs factor into their meal decisions.
“So people not gon get the best chicken sammich and lemonade on the planet because of a personal belief? Word?”
Idk maybe it‘s just me but I could care less about what people choose to believe in as long as I’m good
At one point, someone asked him if he would boycott Chick-fil-A “if the owner came out and said slavery was a good idea.”
His response:
“Chicken too tasty.”
Is this guy serious, or maybe he’s joking around?
We have eaten at Chick-fil-A many times, but their chicken is not that good for us to keep supporting their business if they hypothetically came out in support of slavery.
Some people just don’t know the impact that slavery had on the past and present state of African-American families.
ANY THOUGHTS ON DURANT’S COMMENTS?

Justin is no dummy. He knew what he was saying and I totally get it. The fact that anyone would try and equate gay marriage with slavery is ridiculous and insulting so Justin called their bluff and said he would eat the chicken anyway. His point, as I interpret it, is that the ghay community has an agenda that is about trying to make every other community and establishment kiss their behind. They want to be the number one minority and eventually the majority and I say bump them and their wack philosophy and immoral lifestyle. Leave chic-Fil-A alone. If you aren’t boycotting Khols which has an openly racist CEO then why should black folk care about boycotting a chicken spot?

Pell’s Quadrant essay is sooooo wrong
Posted by Dave Bath on 2007-09-05
The current (2007-09) issue of QuadRant has more pieces deserving challenge than usual, but Archbishop Pell’s encomium of Constantine I is a particularly dangerous essay, providing arguments for those who call for cataclysmic overthrow of the state and the introduction of a world-wide Caliphate.
His selective marshalling of facts and interpretation of history in "Constantine: The First Catholic Emperor" are barely less twisted than the holocaust-denying David Irving. Like Irving, Pell cannot fall back on the lame excuses of poor education or lack of intellectual capacity.
The essay really should be dissected line-by-line, but I don’t have the time.
It is unsurprising that a key member of the CDF, the rebadged Spanish Inquisition, would produce such a piece, desirous of the necessary and sufficient preconditions for a new Dark Ages, replacing liberal democracies with autocratic theocracies.
What is surprising is that QuadRant editors agreed to publish it, unless they see praise of Constantine as implying praise of Howard’s manipulative entangling of religion and politics.
First I’ll discuss the political aspects of the work, then it’s flaws regarding the history of moral philosophy and theology.
Apologist for terrorist literature:
Pell states (p55):
The cult of the "divine" emperor was also an explicit buttress for the unity of the empire, so that Christian refusal to offer sacrifice to the emperor and the traditional gods also brought undesirable political consequences and helps explain the persecutions. … Christians were not violent revolutionaries, like the Jewish Zealots not terrorists or anarchists, and repeated persecutions had not eliminated or radically diminished their numbers.
Persecution? More Christians died in the arena under emperors that were "Christian" rather than pagan. The worst emperors who persecuted Christians terrorized the entire population regardless of religion.
Pell knows that the more "important buttress for the unity of the empire" was the policy of religious tolerance, of anything but human sacrifice. Pell, like many Latin students, would have pored over the letters between Trajan and his governor in Bithynia, Pliny the Younger. He would know of many reasons why Romans were deeply worried about Christians while Jews were readily accepted (even if considered "weird"):
- Christians refused to take a loyalty oath, a sprinkle of incense on an altar and a form of words little more than "God save the Queen", little less disrespectful of a single deity than the way modern Roman Catholics pray to saints.
- The secrecy about Christian rites did not stop hints of human sacrifice and cannibalism: blood mixed in wine, bodies mixed in bread. Combine this with worship of the "Christ Child" and we can see why rumors spread that Christians killed and ate babies, and why feeding Christians to the lions was considered poetic justice.
- Roman authorities, just like all biblical scholars, recognize that the Book of Revelation of St John of Patmos revels in the thought of the cataclysmic downfall of Rome thinly disguised as the "Whore of Babylon". Christians promoted this and similar works as scripture.
Any state is justified in prosecuting those who refuse to accept the rule of law, who are proselytes for literature that is frankly seditious. Ruddock’s censorship, in the name of "anti-terrorism", of far less inflammatory literature (such as that praising East Timor’s struggle for independence) is far more restrictive than the Roman intolerance of apocalytic texts.
Thus, Pell is an apologist for those who not only refuse loyalty oaths, but call for the violent overthrow of the state.
Pell, a critic of Islam because of a minority who hope for the overthrow of our system of government from unwarranted confidence in the wisdom of power-hungry clerics, praises exactly the same excesses of Christianity.
Apologist for a Caliphate:
Pell gives almost unalloyed praise of Constantine’s institutionalization of co-dependent political and religious power. This is the same political structure as the world caliphate desired by radical Islamists.
Constantine did not bring religious freedom, but promoted one religion, and manipulated it to achieve mastery of its doctrine and adherents, without explicit prohibition of other religions.
Constantine was not "disappointed by the lack of Christian doctrinal unity", but exploited it. He gave favors first to one group of clerics, then another, ensuring that none remained confident of patronage, keeping them all subservient, ensuring that all promoted doctrines served the political imperitives.
The tame clerics were ordered to produce a canonical bible and creed, one that necessitated state-sponsored church intercession between god and human. Non-canonical scripture could then be treated as heresy, especially Gnostic scripture that allowed individuals to commune directly with their god.
If you held heretic views, you were (if lucky) exiled.
The shaping of convenient Christian doctrine under Constantine is one of the reasons why more remnants of early Christianity are found in Islam, inheritor of Christian traditions that moved south and east, out of Constantine’s domain and into less-prescriptive Persia’s.
Far from bringing religious "peace", Constantine implicitly incited violence between Christian sects in the same way Howard implicitly incites xenophobia and racism in modern Australia while keeping hollow deniability.
Indeed violence between Christian sects became so prevalent that Christians were angered when a later pagan emperor, Julian the Apostate, created stiff penalties for religiously-motivated violence against persons and property, many Christians regarded this as persecution, a constraint on their religion.
While there was nominal religious freedom, Constantine had de facto power to channel the private religious belief of citizens using self-seeking clergy as proxies.
Pell’s praise for this system demonstrates his view that independent religious thought is invalid, and rejects the ideal of separation of church and state. This is consistent with the way Pell threatens parliamentarians with excommunication if they vote according to private conscience.
There is little difference between Pell’s ideal world and the world caliphate desired by radical Islamists other than his choice for one Abrahamist book over another, and his preference for one clerically-determined legal system (Canon Law) over another (Sharia).
A 21st Century Spanish Inquisitor, Pell has always sought authoritarian consolidation of religious and political power – providing he is a prince of the dominant clergy. Pell’s antipathy to democratic political structures developed before the Dark Ages or since the Renaissance is dangerously clear.
It’s OK to slaughter first, see a cleric later
For someone who has criticized "moral relativism", Pell’s recounting of the history of morality is particularly twisted.
"(With Christianity) … Humility became a virtue rather than un-Roman weakness."
Pell conveniently forgets nearly a thousand years of non-Christian philosophy that stressed duty to the common good rather than selfishness. Hubris, the antonym of humility, had been recognized since Homer as a major vice that would anger the gods. Even ignoring the Greeks, we can see strict morality in the many works of Cicero. We cannot read the journal of the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Philosophus*) without sensing his deep humility, his desire to serve not rule.
Ever since Aristotle tutored Alexander, the classical world believed that rigorous training in ethics was a key element of any education, particularly for the ruling classes.
If humility is a virtue, it’s hard to praise Constantine, who introduced so much pomp into the imperial court, and wanted himself called "The Thirteenth Apostle".
Pell continues to rewrite the history of moral philosophy:
The capricious and disinterested gods, who never made any moral demands on their human subjects, were rejected and destroyed to be replaced by the one God who was rational, loving, and judge of everyone.
Even the peasants who held to the myths of the hellenic pantheon understood that Zeus/Jupiter imposed moral demands on humans. Homer’s Odyssey has as a major theme the moral duty to treat strangers with charity. The evolving nature of justice, from the unthinking revenge of the Furies to the more rational justice of Athens that took mitigating circumstances into account (justice in a Zeus-like mode) is the theme of the Orestian Trilogy… and that’s just the stories of the anthropomorphic pantheon!
The pantheist hellenist philosophies, whether of academy, lyceum, stoa or kennel, all described justice, charity and compassion to fellow humans as a duty owed by all mortals to a more numinous god, not anthropomorphic, but still given labels such as Zeus Pater, Jupiter, or Deus Pater.
Pell should admit these linguistic truths: it was the hellenist tradition, not the semitic, that gave rise to Deus Pater, God the Father. Pell should admit that anything of moral or intellectual rigor and subtlety in Christianity was not inherited via Jerusalem but via Athens. Pell knows this, as he has without doubt read early Christian thinkers such Augustine, Origin, Boethius, together with the works by victims of Christian intellectual parricide such as Porphyry and Plotinus.
Pell also makes the following amazing statement:
After Constantine, one did not have to be a moral hero to follow Christ, and this is a blessing for most of us; indeed for all Christians.
This is not a minor quote, but a sentence printed in double-sized letters. In my opinion, heroism is not defined by what you achieve, but what you try to achieve. Unless you make a serious attempt at what Thomas à Kempis called "The Imitation of Christ", you have no right to call yourself a Christian without adding "hypocrite".
I’d perhaps go further than Pell: moral heroism can be an impediment to following Pell’s Christianity, and vice versa.
Pell goes on to say how wonderful it was the priests became able to absolve even the murder of innocent sons and family members, something very convenient for Contantine and the rest of his dynasty apart from Julian. Personally, I see much more merit in earlier positions: these barbarities were punished by the Furies in Greek tradition (even if you killed your mother because she killed your father), and in Christianity before Constantine, no earthly representative, but only God in heaven, could provide absolution of acts that contravene such fundamental human values.
I can see why Pell would follow this logic of allowing bureaucratic mortals to inherit divine powers of absolution. It becomes possible for two pederast priests to absolve each other under seal of the confessional. How convenient! Pell has found his way of reconciling Papal Infallibility with the ability of a Borgia pope to screw both a mother and her pubescent daughter in the same bed, moving from one to the other without missing a stroke.
But then, Pell was a supporter of John Paul II, advocate of "Millenial Indulgences", forgiveness of sins past or future by paying money to the Church. Pell probably thinks imams should not promise heaven to suicide bombers unless they first sign all their money over to the mosque!
Bringing on the Dark Ages
Pell over-simplifies Gibbon’s analysis of the fall of the Roman Empire as due merely to Christianity, and then rejects this hollow thesis. Pell forgets that Gibbon also blamed other mystery religions for intellectual decline, the problems when soldiers support individual politicians, increased military expenditure at the expense of infrastructure … the list goes on.
Meanwhile, Pell praises Constantine as the saviour of empire because of short-term fiscal and monetary reforms that gave the appearance of economic probity while running down infrastructure. The treasury may have been full (a budget surplus), but the empire bled silver to Parthia and on to China in continuing trade and current account deficits. Such practices ensured the economic ruin of the empire. Again, there are similarities to Howard.
Gibbon may have been unaware of the effect of plague on the economy, but Gibbons analysis of the intellectual stultification demanded by Constantine’s form of Christianity is spot on when we think not of the fall of the political entity that was Rome, but the fall of classical civilization.
Athens, Sparta, Alexander, Pontus, Ptolemaic Egypt: all rose and fell without causing western civilization to fall. It is probable that without Constantine’s version of Christianity, Rome would have fallen, but civilization would have continued without a Dark Age.
Conclusions
Pell asserts Constantine is the enabler and progenitor of the Roman Catholic Church, and that both are praiseworthy. I’d agree about the relationship between the two, but consider them equally odious.
Pell points out the relevance of Gibbon’s subject matter, and I’d agree, but add we are ignoring Gibbon’s lessons and risk another fall.
While we can enjoy the similarities between the cynical manipulation of religion and politics by Constantine and Howard, the similarities between short-term appearance of economic probity that destroyed the long-term viability of the economy, the danger from this essay is Pell’s metaphor that is as transparent as the "Whore of Babylon".
Hellenic, rational, scientific, religiously-tolerant pre-Constantine Rome represents secular, rational, scientific, pluralist liberal democracies. Pell is happy to see such polities destroyed, replaced by a co-dependency of temporal and spiritual power that can constrain the development of moral philosophy and metaphysics, make the population and intellectual elite subservient, twist religion for political gain, and lay the groundwork for another Dark Age where religion, not science, holds sway.
What can you expect from the Sydney Inquisition: Fear, surprise, a fanatical devotion to the pope, and a relaxing and comfy chair?

That was pretty good. I’m going to re-read it and I think you’ve earned quote of the week.
I found the quote “to be replaced by the one God who was rational, loving, and judge of everyone.” deserving of a bit more scorn though, considering that Pell and current Pope have explicitly railed against reason. Add to that the opinion from a WA clergyman that people should surrender their intellect and you have a movement within Catholicism that doesn’t value the rational.
I reckon if you cleaned up a couple of the whole-word typos “than/that” and you could have one of the best blogosphere posts of the year here.

Frenchville’s Shawn Martin had a busy winter.
The Late Model driver at Oxford Plains Speedway said the time was right to build a new racecar and that’s exactly what he did.
“I built a brand new chassis. It’s an [Chevy] Impala body. The old car is still pretty good but it was time for a new one,” explained Martin. “An interesting note is that Austin Theriault built a car identical to mine. They’re sister cars.
Theriault is the 16-year-old driver from Fort Kent who will be racing in the American-Canadian Tour and Pro All-Stars Series features.
Martin, who now lives in Turner, obtained the chassis from Race Basics in Andover.
The 31-year-old, who works for Oxford Networks, a communications provider, will debut in his new car on Sunday when the ACT 150 will be held at OPS.
It will be opening day at OPS and racing will begin at 2 p.m. Oxford Championship and Oxford Acceleration Series features will also be held.
He said he has made a bunch of adjustments on his new car based on the knowledge he obtained from driving his previous cars.
“This one is easier to work on. It’s more user-friendly,” said the Wisdom High School of St. Agatha graduate.
He has tested his new car and said, “It felt pretty good. It was a hot day so the speed wasn’t super fast. A lot had to do with the track conditions. The real test will come with the other cars on Saturday.”
Drivers will be able to practice on Saturday.
Martin, who started his racing career at Caribou’s Spud Speedway, has strung together some solid seasons.
He won the Late Model points championship at OPS in 2004, has back-to-back top five finishes in the TB Bank Oxford 250 and was fourth in Late Model points at OPS last season.
He finished fifth in the 250 after starting 29th. Two years ago, he was fourth after starting 25th.
“I had a fairly good year last year,” said Martin. “I started off really well. But I had a lot of horrible luck in the second half. It seemed like every week I got a flat tire.”
His main focus this season is to qualify for the ACT race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, N.H. on Sept. 18.
“That can be accomplished two ways: win the [points] championship at Oxford or win an ACT-sanctioned event,” said Martin, who prefers longer races.
So he will run in the weekly Late Model class at OPS and also race selected ACT events.
“I’m ready for another [points] championship,” said Martin.
He enjoys racing with the ACT drivers, saying, “I love it. Those guys are some of the best racers in the region. And they’re some of the most respectful drivers you’ll find. You can race side-by-side with them and never get a dent in your car.”
He said it is more challenging than the OPS Late Model class.
“Instead of having 10 drivers capable of winning the race, you have 30 in the ACT race. You definitely have to step up your game,” he said.
Martin is looking forward to Sunday’s race and is confident.
“I feel like I can win every time I’m in a race car,” said Martin who also recognizes that it will take a little time at adapt to his new car.
He does intend to return to race at his home track in Caribou as he has the past two years.
“I try to keep the tradition by racing there every year. It’s exciting to go back,” said Martin who also has sponsors with ties to Aroostook County.
Unity gets under way Saturday
Unity Raceway will kick off its season on Saturday at 4 p.m.
There will be nine classes of racing and George Fernald Jr., who leases the track from Ralph and Nancy Nason, said he is optimistic.
“We’re looking good,” said Fernald, who is in his third season leasing the track. “We have 200 cars signed up. I figure we’ll get between 100-120.”
That would mean an average of 11-13 cars per class.
“And the way things are looking, we’d have 15-20 cars in each class by June,” said Fernald. “We’re looking for ways to find room so we can park everyone [racecars] in the pits.”
In his first two seasons, Fernald held his races on Friday nights, but that will probably change.
With nine classes, Fernald said the biggest complaint he heard is it “goes too late” on Friday nights.
His Friday night race cards began at 6:30 and he had to finish racing by midnight due to a town ordinance.
“We went [past midnight] a few times,” he admitted.
If he moves to Saturday night, he would start at 5:30.
He couldn’t start too early on Friday because drivers and fans have to get out of work.
He will make a decision within the next few weeks after talking to drivers.
“I don’t think I have much choice [but to move to Saturday night],” he said.
If Fernald goes to Saturday night racing, he would be in direct competition with Hermon’s Speedway 95, just 40 miles from Unity.
Speedway 95 holds its races on Sunday afternoon before switching over to Saturday nights on June 12.
“I’m friends with Del [Speedway 95 co-owner Del Merritt] and I don’t want to tick him off. But I’ve got to do what I have to do to survive,” said Fernald. “I’ve got to pull out all the stops to make money. My wife [Sherry] said if we don’t make money, we’re out of here.”

BELFAST, Maine — The stretch of Herrick Road now under construction at the Little River is decidedly bucolic, with llamas grazing peaceably in nearby green fields and the river flowing gently to the city reservoir.
But the bridge that started to take shape across the river Wednesday to replace the worn-out 1921 structure is at the cutting edge of technology.
When completed, the 48-foot-long arch of concrete-filled carbon-fiber tubes will be the largest “Bridge in a Backpack” constructed in Maine. It should last much longer than a typical steel or concrete bridge and essentially eliminate bridge maintenance, according to Project Manager Nate Benoit of the Maine Department of Transportation.
“Right now, we’re in the process of further developing the technology,” he said. “With experience, we expect to come up with more innovative ways to use the tubes and to decrease construction time.”
Wednesday afternoon, the construction crew from Stetson & Watson contractors of Pittsfield appeared to easily maneuver the long but light tubes into place across the river to make perfect arches. Altogether, 16 of the tubes will be placed and filled with concrete to make the bridge, according to Bob Schmitt, a representative of Advanced Infrastructure Technologies, the Orono company that is licensing the new composite technology invented at the University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center.
The Bridge in a Backpack, which was introduced by center director Habib Dagher.
Officials have touted the technology as being cheaper, easier to install, longer lasting and better for the environment than traditional bridges, but Benoit said that the Belfast bridge is “cost competitive” with a traditional structure.
Between the $873,167 low bid from Stetson & Watson and the $245,000 needed to purchase the tubes from AIT, the project will cost a total of $1.1 million, he said.
It won’t be completed until June 15, 2011, but the road over the river should be open to traffic by Thanksgiving.
The bridge is the third of six backpack bridges to be constructed through the DOT, which is responsible for all bridges longer than 20 feet on local roads in the state. The project began after a Minneapolis bridge collapsed in 2007, and Gov. John Baldacci signed a bill to increase Maine’s bridge funding. An increase in vehicle registration fees has added an extra $40 million per year for four years to the state’s bridge budget, Benoit said.

(I've been looking at a lot of 1930s pattern leaflets lately and the language is catching.) What I mean is, I have finished the cotton/linen mesh cardigan I wrote about here.
I finished it a couple of weeks ago, in fact, and have worn it a few times already. But I have been busy since then with my next knitting project, which I hope to wear tomorrow, so not much time for blogging. But that's nearly finished now - more later.
The finished cardigan is in a slubby cotton/linen yarn from Stylecraft, now discontinued. It is very rough to knit with, but nice to wear. Knitting the mesh pieces was quite fast and easy, but finishing was tedious. The button band took a long time - you would think that knitting a strip only 13 stitches wide would be quick, but it wasn't. And then a lot of sewing. The buttons are mother-of-pearl squares off an old duvet cover - I put them on as a temporary measure but they look good, and seem to take up the green of the yarn (they are actually a natural creamy colour), so I will stick with them.
I was a bit disappointed that the button band stands up higher than I expected at the back. I should have anticipated that, because there is no back neck shaping - you just cast off the middle stitches after doing the shoulder shaping. But in fact it looks exactly right with a shirt underneath.
And that's how it was shown in the original pattern. It's from a Wendy pattern book, for a cotton/linen yarn (Pampas) that they produced in the 1980s, I guess. The pattern had a dropped shoulder and I changed that to a set-in sleeve, and the yarn I used is thicker and nubblier, so the overall effect is chunkier, but I think it has turned out well.
Looking at the photo from the book makes me wish for some sunshine to wear my cardigan in. Although we have not had floods here, as they have in many parts of the country, it has been cold and wet. Some proper summer weather would be nice.

An attorney says a group known as T-Rex St. John LLC (nice image, isn't that?) plans to build a marina, condominium and commercial development on Moravian Church property in Coral Bay, according to the St. John Source. David Bornn was quoted saying while plans are preliminary, "We just finished documentation with the church." Bornn added, "It's a community-oriented project and will benefit Coral Bay." The church-owned land is a waterfront strip that runs behind Guy Benjamin School, the fire house, and Skinny Legs, the Source reported.

Barnegat Settles with County Over Menk Homes
Ocean County to pay $250,000 for cost of inspections of hundreds of Four Seasons at Mirage homes
Barnegat Township has settled a long-running lawsuit with the county over home inspections in the Four Seasons at Mirage development, though officials say ongoing litigation with the developer responsible for the flawed construction may continue for some time.
The township will receive a $250,000 cash settlement and “other considerations” from Ocean County, ending a 2010 lawsuit over who was responsible for Uniform Construction Code inspections of Mirage homes that had a number of structural issues. Barnegat also filed suit with developer Menk Corporation, which built the homes with what the township said were UCC violations.
By 2006, many Mirage residents in Menk-built homes were complaining of leaky crawl spaces and other problems. Then and current mayor Al Cirulli and Committeeman Jeff Melchiondo promised the issues would be fixed, said township administrator David Breeden.
Ultimately, 467 homes had UCC violations, which were remedied, said Breeden. But the issue of who would pay for the fixes still wasn’t resolved by 2010.
“The initial goal of the effort was to abate the UCC violations,” Breeden said. “Having safe homes along with a deserving quality of life for the Menk homeowners was the priority, and once that was accomplished, then the township could turn its attention to seeking reimbursement from responsible parties.”
Barnegat maintained that it was the county that was responsible for conducting the UCC inspections, and should have picked up the tab. The settlement resolves that issue, Breeden said.
But reaching a settlement with Menk could be a long road, officials said.
“Menk looks like it will go all the way through with litigation,” said Cirulli. “Luckily the county did the right thing."
“Even though Menk has made the needed repairs required to abate the UCC violations, the Township is of the position that Menk has an obligation to reimburse Barnegat taxpayers for cost associated with forcing Menk to render necessary repairs,” said Breeden. "Barnegat is pleased that we were able to reach a resolution with the county. The Township strongly believes this agreement will re energize our relationship with the county which will be beneficial for Barnegat residents. We appreciate the willingness of the county to work with the Township and resolve this matter."

They threw alot of figures around last night about this lawsuit. From what I remember, the mayor said a year ago that we had spent almost 1.25 million on the lawsuit in professional fees. This was primarily the counties fault for their inspectors passing this sub-par work. So they give us $250,000 and other considerations that can't be disclosed at this time (?). The repairs were done at Menk's expense. So it seems like the county settled for less than half of what we spent and we have to go after Menk for the rest. I guess something is better than nothing.
Oh, and by the way, what we heard about the Lower Shore Road Ballfield turf fiasco, (backed up with proof from Ralph Adorno and Jake Taylor), I would propose we make that crap disappear. Accept the fact that we got screwed and start from scratch, how bout grass?
Hopefully the video from the meeting last night graciously shot by Morris Flory will be up on the Township website (along with the previous meetings video that never made it), so the town can see and hear the turf story.
A good point about last nights meeting was a positive report from Marty Lisella and David Breeden about their meeting with the commissioner in Trenton about our assessment problem. They seem to be making headway, with another meeting in three weeks, we will hear more results.

Mr. Effron, you are free to speak, so please tell everyone in Barnegat why you fear my words so much that you have them removed from the Patch. You are not the editor, but you think you have the right to remove what YOU DON"T AGREE WITH. It is that kind of weak, fearful, intolerance that "We the People" reject. How dare you try to silence others while you promote yourself for political office. Brave people have fought and died for YOU to have the freedom of speech, while you hit the "Flag as inappropriate" button to deny others of that right. That sir is wrong!

Ok, we sued for 1.2 million that the town said they spent on the menk inspections. We sttled for 250K , less then 1/4 and "little Napoleon" is happy with that. How about the homeowners in the Mirage suing Menk? That's what should have happened.

Menk and Hovanian should have paid for it all, when homeowners sell a house they have to sign a full disclosure statement. Why not Menk. Hovanian bought the development and should have inherited all liabilities also. Ocean County did the inspections at the time, not Barnegat, we shouldn't be held responsible. There should have been a class action lawsuit by the homeowners involved, Barnegat shouldn't have invested 1.2 million on follow up inspections.

I also don't think that "the site" should be used as a platform for political candidates to push their own personal agenda while the taxpayers have their posts deleted. Freedom of speech should be more important than personal agendas. If a post is a violation of your TOS, then it should be removed by the Editor. The people removing posts should be "banned", not the people who follow the rules and want to voice an opinion. Sorry, I did not ignore any emails. I do not use email and rarely check it. I only wanted to voice an opinion on the Barnegat Patch. Your apology should be to those of us that feel strongly about fairness and the freedom of speech.

go to to read the comment removed above from the Patch. The Editor should step in and restore the posts that "someone" wants to hide from the people of Barnegat. The censorship here on the Patch is un-American. If this is allowed to continue, I will consider boycotting any advertisers on the Patch that support this behavior with their ad dollars.

i guess we all forgot the print out that shocked the public when the costs were presented. when in fact the town did not have to intervene per the state. the reason was to fold 1. it was
a payday for hess-birdsall and dasti. 2 this lent credence to all the inspectors we hired remember?

Mr. Cirulli expressing joy over a settlement that recovers barely 23% of what Barnegat spent speaks volumes. Mr. Cirulli simply lacks what it takes to be mayor.
Until and unless people wake up and take a moment to see what is in front of their noses, Barnegat will never, ever see improvement. Every project this town undertakes seems shrouded in controversy. Presenting plaques to a group of cheerleaders (all good kids) does not hide the countless failures of the five department store dummies that masquerade as town leaders.
Notice how Mr. Effron mentions that not all of the videos of committee meetings are on the township website. Gee, I wonder why?
No one can save Barnegat from apathy. If the people who have a financial and quality of life stake in Barnegat choose to keep reelecting incompetent dolts to public office then I guess they enjoy being a laughing stock. Hey, they get reelected time-and-again so someone must think what they are doing is just peachy.

Eric, The reason for the delay of the Videos is technical. I have been trying to get them up within a reasonable timeframe 24-48 hours. But between computer crashes and now having to split the videos due to size has taken a little more time than foreseen. Also what we have learned is the Barnegat Township web site seems to slowdown with the loading of more videos probably due to size. I think 21 Feb is up now and hopefully next week 5 March will be also.

The mayor acted like we had just struck gold when we won 23% of our own money back, plus some other "STUFF" that he could not talk about. You can't talk about our money? Maybe some of that STUF" is the waste of our money by installing either a water fountain or bird bath in the Park at Bay Ave.and Rt.9. Or maybe some of that"STUFF" is the use of Barnegat Township equipment to sweep the County road infront of the ex Mayors business and the Italian eatery in that same area. Maybe the extra "STFF" from the County will be the replacement of the two tree that were removed from infront of that same eatery over a year ago. Guess the trees block some signs.

For the person that comments, “To cry that you can't do something simple because of something "technical" is a weak excuse” , should learn to speak the truth regarding the video tapings and posting. You have no knowledge of the inner workings on how this is completed and thus without knowledge you speak.

If there are professionals here that would like to volunteer their time, equipment, software and expertise they are most welcome.

Thank you for proving my point. It is simple. The funny thing is that when Mr. Effron was asked what he has done for the people of Barnegat for the past 20 years he said "NOTHING". All he did was attack our towns leaders and the website saying he could do better (only if he is elected, I guess). The question for you Mr. Flory is why didn't Mr. Effron do anything?

10:39 am on Saturday, March 10, 2012
Mr. Cataldo is correct. Voters do not care. Or perhaps, Mr. Cataldo, you and I are wrong. Perhaps the current state of Barnegat is all wine and roses.
Somehow, I don't think so. The scores of abandoned homes, homes that cannot be sold even at rock bottom prices are a significant indicator that our town is not the #1 place in Ocean County - no matter what paid-for magazine awards proclaim.
The five department store dummies on the committee adore photo ops with cheerleaders, hero cops, etc. But that does not overshadow their abysmal failure to oversee the management of Barnegat with effectiveness.
I used to believe strongly in Mr. Morano. However, other than his knee-jerk "NO" votes on many resolutions, what alternatives has he offered? It is easy to sit and criticize when you always have the fallback of "I'm the lone democrat so they won't listen to me." Identify one plan, one strategy Mr. Morano has presented to the public. He is the same as the other four. Smile for the camera - nuts to the problems.
In her recent editorial, Ms. Clemente suggested that a taxpayer organization be formed. Not a bad idea. It would take a shelving of egos and an education as to the meaning of "compromise." I hope she pursues it.
Censoring Mr. Wise or anybody else is cowardly. Whomever is doing it needs to grow up. The burden of democracy is to give another person equal opportunity to be heard even if you detest what they say.
Bob Wise
11:14 am on Saturday, March 10, 2012
You and I both know who the censor is Mr. Thomas, and thats the problem. The truth is not spoken in Barnegat. How many good men stand up and speak it? When they do they are attacked as everyone else sits back and watches in silence. Yes, the editor threatened to ban me for being the victim that dared to ask a politician a question. So, everyone can go and wish her luck as she leaves town, while we and our children will stay and pay the price of the what the distortions, propaganda, lies, and censorship on the Patch have cost Barnegat. The ones in power stay in power, the way the shills want it. At least some of us had the courage to say something before our words were deleted.

Even though Tropical Storm Debby may not be coming ashore near us, she's already causing problems for our nests.
The Ft. Pickens campgrounds were evacuated last night due to high surf/flooding. I arrived at the gate around 4:40 this morning, earlier than usual, so I could get my patrol in and exit the Park before the rain hit us. But Park Rangers were already at the gate to make sure no one entered, informing me that salt water was already covering portions of the road. They had made their last run at midnight and barely got out before the Gulf water started washing across in some areas.
I was bummed that I couldn't do my patrol - the second time in two weeks - but much more so because this almost certainly means the nest of "Mama Mia", the sea turtle I video-taped last week, will be washed out by the time Tropical Storm Debby is finished. Nest FP 6171 (Mama Mia's nest) was only 40' from the water, although it was on a bit of an elevation. It's surely in jeopardy.
Maybe it's a reminder than sea turtles know more than we do. This time last year, Ft. Pickens area of GINS had ten nests; to date this year we only have four. There's a similar situation with Perdido Key. This time last year Perdido Key already had fifteen nests; to date this year they have had seven.
By contrast, at Santa Rosa this time last year they had eleven nests; to date this year, Santa Rosa GINS has 19. Pensacola Beach has two more nests to date than they had this time last year.
Keep your fingers crossed for this to move past quickly and cause minimum damage. I'll keep you updated as I learn more.

SE3 Condenser Microphone from SE Electronics
Sonic Distribution is now handling the SE Electronics line of imported studio condensers. The SE3 caught my eye at the Summer NAMM Show in Nashville and is their flagship "pencil" microphone with a fixed cardioid pattern and 48V phantom powering. This mic uses Class A FET amplifier electronics and has both low cut filter and -10dB pad switches.
I had the opportunity to try this mic out on several sources while recording a band and was impressed by its natural sound and all around usefulness. I used it for acoustic guitar overdubs where the low cut filter helped to tame a jumbo bodied guitar's boomy sound. The gentle presence lift added a sparkle without using EQ. I also tried it on drums and cymbals and it (using the pad) didn't fold up (overload) at all. I even tried it on vocals with good results although it does 'pop' easily and required a couple of pop screens.
Housed in an elegantly finished new body design, it comes with a sturdy shock mount and packaged in a deluxe wooden travel case. Significant specifications are: frequency response rated at 20Hz-20khz; sensitivity is 10mV/Pa +/- 2dB; noise level is 17dB (A weighted); and Max SPL for 0.5% THD @ 1kHz is 135dB.
I certainly found a 'Swiss army knife' of a condenser with the SE3 and I completely recommend it for any studio task especially acoustic instruments such as guitar, violin, cello or string bass. The SE3 sells for $349 MSRP and for much more contact Sonic Distribution at 617-623-5581 or go to:

Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland said it’s “99.9 percent” certain that SP Zach Miner will not be the team’s fifth starter, according to Tom Gage of The Detroit News. This means there are three candidates remaining for the position – Rick Porcello, Nate Robertson and Dontrelle Willis.
Our Instinct: Miner is likely heading to Triple-A, he was horrible this spring, but then so has Dontrelle Willis, who is all but through. Robertson has been effective and should be the 5th starter, while Porcello who has looked good will go to the minors as to not start his service yet.

tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-155666572013-05-18T00:37:37.658-05:00Baseball ThinkingBaseball Thinking is a blog site dedicated to the spastic thinking of a longtime baseball fan. Thanks for stopping in and sharing your thoughts while reading his.Tommy Dee is the Red Sox catcher of the future?During the 2010 Red Sox spring training, there were open discussions regarding a contract extension for Victor Martinez. Many speculated that the catcher slash first baseman might sign an extension. When asked in February, Victor told the Boston Herald that he wants to remain in Boston. And his agent, Alan Nero of Octagon, told Gordon Edes of ESPN that even though he wants to stay, the Red Sox must pay him to stay. Martinez wants to be paid as a catcher. But do the Sox want him as a catcher? <br /><br />As a catcher, Martinez has thrown out approximately 23% of base runners, below the average of 30%. In 2008, he did catch 37% of potential base stealers, but only 22 stolen bases were attempted against him, by far the lowest. In 2010, he is beginning the year in a 1 for 12 slump. <br /><br />Defensively speaking, Martinez is not a very good catcher. The Sox feeling is that he might have one or two years left as a starting catcher and they are looking for him to become their 1B/DH. Very few teams will give a 32 year old catcher a large, multi-year contract. But Martinez wants to be paid as a catcher. Negotiations will become tense, for sure. <br /><br />The Red Sox have no potential starting catchers in their minor league system. Dusty Brown is not the answer. They gave up the rights to George Kottaras and Milwaukee quickly (in minutes) plucked him off the waiver wire. Former farmhand Kelly Shoppach was recently traded to the Tampa Bay Rays and the Sox certainly could have used his services. Shoppach for Crisp – what a trade! <br /><br />Moving forward, Martinez wants to catch and the Sox want him at first base. While negotiations will be honest, they will not be fruitful. Victor Martinez should sign with another team once his $7.7M contract expires at years’ end. Then who will the Sox sign to catch?Tommy Dee Tanguy Fired from Sports Hub!There is a God!<br /><br />A lot of times it seems like the inevitable is, well, inevitable. Sometimes the inevitable takes a lot longer than anticipated. On Friday, April 2nd, 2010, the inevitable arrived for Gary “Muffay” Tanguay. The beleaguered mid-day radio host of Tanguay and Zolak was fired from his cushy gig at the Sports Hub, Boston’s number one sports radio station (opinion, not fact). Tang Gay is now free to beat the meat with Pete “the meat” Shephard, who is also unemployed after being tanked by WEEI recently. <br /><br />Tanguay will be replaced by Andy Gresh, which is the equivalent of going from a 1972 Ford Pinto to a 2002 pickup. Sports Hub program director Mike Thomas was irked that the story was leaked by brain dead intern Courtney Fallon, whose career in the Boston sports scene is over before it started. What a tool! She was ordered to remove the Tweets within the hour. She was also told to head directly to Mass General for a complete brain scan. <br /><br />Although this can’t be verified, it is being reported that Scott Zolak, his former partner, is ecstatic that Tanguy has been replaced by his old friend Gresh. It isn’t that Zolak has refused comment; he just can’t stop laughing long enough to speak coherently. A going away party is being planned by the staff of the Sports Hub but it isn’t known if Tanguay has been invited. <br /><br />Chad Finn, a paid blogger for the Boston Globe, (who closely resembles a middle-aged lesbian I once knew), wrote that Tanguay was devastated by the fact he was fired. Really? He received this information from a second brilliant Tweet from Fallon. ( ) <br /><br />Apparently, Tanguay didn’t see this coming, but no one is surprised. Listeners tuned out months ago. His constant yells of “Jesus” and “Christ” on the air ruffled the feathers of many, including his superiors. His ignorance was clear. His character was weak. <br /><br />His lack of vision became evident during his infamous broadcasts of college football games for Comcast SportsNet. During one college football game in 2009, Tanguay reported to viewers that it was third and short. Andy Gresh, who was his analyst, corrected him and told him it was third and eight. Unbelievable! During the same game, he reported the first two point interception in football history! Historic! After a UMaine football game, he reported that the head coach of the Black Bears bled green, even though the school colors are blue and white. Moronic! And when he reported that a team was going for it on fourth down, Gresh once again corrected him and told Tanguay that the team was actually punting the football. Brilliant! My question is what took so long in getting rid of this clown? Even though he is close to fifty years old and grew up in New England, he knows absolutely nothing about New England sports. <br /><br />Best of luck, Gary, as you will need it beginning of the end of the New England PatriotsWhat happened to the legendary New England Patriots? They are a just a shell of their former selves. During their Super Bowl win of 2001, they chose to be introduced as a team. Their roster consisted of relative unknowns, players with some athletic ability but mostly intelligence. Their defense was tough and they won the close games. What has happened?<br /><br />During their dream run, they never lost two games in a row. That has changed. BB never made mistakes. Wow, has that really changed or what? Their defensive schemes were smart and difficult for the opposition to figure out. Not any more. They can’t get to the quarterback and their secondary gives up a ton of points to the worst offensive teams in the NFL. The offense had some surprises and made big plays. There is no guessing about the pats offense these days. They have become very one dimensional and there is no question who will receive the ball on offense. They were a team which got better as each month passed. Now they are the opposite, losing more games in November and December than they have for some time. They can’t win on the road, except London. They are as predictable as the tides. During the prime years, they didn’t beat themselves. They played sixty minutes of football and each player knew their job. Their secondary was outstanding. <br /><br />This is now Patriots Lite. Gone is the mystique, the swagger and the results. BB is being second guessed by everyone, as well he should be. Guys with the name Banta-Cain and Guyton are the best players on defense. That alone is scary. These guys were barely bench players recently. This is the beginning of the end.Tommy Dee ratings continue to slideTony Massarotti of the Boston Globe and The Sports Hub recently wrote an <a href="">article</a> stating that New Englander's, as well as Red Sox management, have become complacent. He also asked New England to root for the Yankees in the World Series. LOL. Why would any true New Englander root for the Yankees? In any situation? When you are done reading this, check out the comments section to his article. Anyway, I wanted to express my views as to why NESN ratings are down and if there is real complacency as far as the Red Sox go. <br /><br />NESN ratings are down for a few reasons. One, their format is very stale. Their pre-scripted pregame/postgame shows can be recited, word by word, by any Red Sox fan. They also have no real, live shows, like CNNSE. Every single word is scripted and stale. There is no off-the-cuff commentary and I find that boring. Every fan knows what will be discussed at 6:38 of any pre-game show. If Tom Caron has any skill and real historic baseball knowledge, I am not aware of it. I do know he is an excellent reader, though. <br /><br />Two, we have become complacent as a Nation. The Sox are on the wrong side of the bell curve at this point. Real fans are shut out from games due to prices, wine and cheese, pink and corporate. Just try nailing down a Sox Pax when tickets go on sale. I used to have a fair chance of getting opening day tickets 7 or 8 years ago. I had a solid chance ten years ago and longer. Now, there are fewer tickets for me due to corporate big wigs and I can never, ever get them the first day they go on sale. Our ticket chances become reduced to lotteries and eBay. A real turn-off. <br /><br />The initial attraction for the newer fans (corporate, pink, cheese, wine, and most girls) was the personality of the team. The Sox have lacked any type of specific personality over the past 2-3 years, which has reduced the initial attraction for the newbie’s, thereby reducing interest and the NESN audience. The Sox have become a team of well-behaved professionals with no visible character. NESN, a reflection and part of the Red Sox, has grown very stale. Add to the fact that the Celtics and Bruins are back playing winning sports dictates that the consumer dollar is spread out over 4 sports instead of 2. No longer is this just a Red Sox and Patriots town. If ratings are down for the Sox, then they are up for someone else.Tommy Dee night football fan kicked out of stadiumThis country is based on a solid foundation of principles. One of these principles is known as freedom of speech, where every American is allowed to express their opinion. This includes holding up signs at sporting events around the country. <br /><br />During the recent Redskins against the Eagles, a man held up a sign which simply read “<a href="">Bingo Night Football</a>”. This was in reference to new offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis, who came out of retirement to lead the Skins offense. In retirement, he was performing volunteer work, which included calling bingo numbers to senior citizens and working with Meals on Wheels. During the ESPN telecast, announcer Mike Tirico mentioned this fact. The fan remains anonymous, but he was escorted from the stadium, asked to leave for such a harmless act. <br /><br />What is wrong with this country? In no way did this fan violate any laws or violate any rules of the stadium. His sign was not offensive to anyone, except those who might have lost at bingo when Lewis was yelling out numbers. I think Skin fans should rally around this fan and support him. If every columnist and announcer in the country can make light fun of this, why can’t a fan voice his opinion if it isn’t offensive to anyone? I hope this fan comes forward and provides details of exactly what happened. The Washington Redskins also have a lot of ‘splaining to do. I smell a lawsuit in the making. Don’t you?Tommy Dee Brady is on the wrong side of thirty ...What is the big deal about turning thirty years old? I am asking because I don’t know. I have heard lots of stuff, but haven’t lived it yet. Tom Brady is over 30. Is it a big deal to him? I think so, and here is why. <br /><br />“Tom Brady sucks!”. I have actually heard that from some panicked fans. It must be true. Five games into the 2009 NFL season, he’s got 6 TD passes to go along with 2 INT’s. During 2007, he had 50 TD passes to go along with only 8 pics. His completion percentage is just below 62%, well below the 69% from 2007 but right along with his career average. He was below 60% two of the past three weeks. His QB rating is about an 86, right around his career average. So what is the big deal? <br /><br />Tom Brady is 32, in his 10th season, a very long time for any football player. He is uncharacteristically missing wide open receivers, unlike the past. He has exploded at teammates on the sidelines, unlike the past. And he is married with children, unlike the past. Tom Brady is becoming normal. <br /><br />But he is on the wrong side of thirty. This might be the best Tom Brady will ever be. Think about that. This could be the best he has to offer. And nothing more. Tom Brady is on the wrong side of thirty.Tommy Dee "Tang Gay" Tanguay is not a truck guyDear Gary “Tang Gay” Tanguay,<br /><br />I hope your having a great day. It’s almost the weekend and its football season! I do want to express my frustration, however, at your “truck guy” commercial. Gary, I am a truck guy. I live in the butt-crack, rifle-rack six-pack state of New Hampshire. Originally from Massachusetts, I was forced to purchase a truck due to the local terrain, But Gary, I am a tall, big and strong man, traits you do not possess. The truck really suits me. Based on the daily spankings you receive on-air, I am just not buying you as a truck guy. When I hear your truck commercial on the radio, credibility is that last thought that crosses my mind. You are at the bottom of the sports talk food chain here in New England. You are the little kid everybody picks on. Among the horses in the <a href="">Sports Hub</a> stable, you are the Shetland pony. <br /><br />So when I hear the radio spot announcing Tang Gay is a truck guy, I don’t buy it. Neither does <a href="">the rest of</a> New England. Perhaps you should do a commercial for Mini Cooper, Dodge Neon, VW Beetle or for the Toyota Rav4, a real chick’s ride. Ever think of doing an MG or Miata commercial? Perhaps you could do a voice-over for the Smart Car. It’s light, small, weak and picked on as well. The credibility just isn’t there for me. You sound very foolish explaining to the global community how cool you have become because you drive a truck. It’s like comparing you to John Madden. Gary, you are not a cool truck guy, regardless of what lies your family tells you. <br /><br />In light of this, have yourself a great day and best of luck with your future endeavors. <br /><br />Love,<br /><br />The sports fans of New EnglandTommy Dee Felger says "tits" on-airDuring the live broadcast Wednesday, October 21st, Mike Felger said “tits” during the Felger and Massarotti show on the <a href="">Sports Hub</a>. At first he was surprised when B Real, his producer, told him he couldn’t say that on air. When you work in the media, you must be 100% sure of all fine-able cuss words. That is part of the job. But he was genuinely surprised. So was I. <br /><br />What is wrong with "tits"? I think it goes along with ass, which is acceptable on air. Ass can be used freely (as in Tang Gays case). Tits and ass. Ebony and ivory. Peaches and cream. They go together. So why is “tits” so offensive? Do you know what I find offensive? <br /><br />Gary Tang Gay and is constant negative connotation of Christ and Jesus. He uses the Lords name in such derogatory terms, yet it is accepted (well, not fine-able). I find it much more offensive when someone casually uses the Lords name in vain than when someone says “tits” or “ass”, or both! I haven’t been to church in years, besides the occasional wedding and funeral, so it is a stretch to call me religious. I have actually written to Gary Tang Gay and asked him not to use the Lords name in vain. He’s still a meat head when it comes to the derogatory use of words. But I have to side with Felger on this one. Why is “tits” a bad word these days?Tommy Dee, a breathe of fresh sports talk air ..New England is famous for many things, but is often associated with sports and their fans. Markets have grown from our love of sports. One of those markets is talk radio. Well, we can now call it a market since there is more than one competitor.<br /><br />In mid-August, the <a href="">Sports Hub</a> was launched, taking over the old Mix 98.5 signal. Finally, in New England, there is a station without static. The Sports Hub provides listeners the opportunity to voice and reflect without interruption or annoying .wav files. The Sports Hub is an intelligent alternative to “static station”. With a full lineup of familiar talent, the Sports Hub is gaining weekly in the ratings and providing intelligent listeners with the long-desired alternative to “static station”. Many stopped listening to “static station” long ago, for many reasons (stale?) Others tried to duplicate it but quickly fell by the wayside because it was an identical product. Finally, New England, global and local fans, has the alternative to “static station”. Finally, a format that cares. Best of luck, Sports Hub.Tommy Dee wish list for Red Sox 2010 lineup ...Here is my wish list for the 2010 lineup of the Boston Red Sox. Leading off will be Tacoby Bellsbury, followed by Pedey, then VMart, Adrian Gonzales, Matt Holliday, Youkilis, Lowell, Drew and Alex Gonzalez. Lowell will be strictly the DH, with an occasional turn by Ortiz. Youkilis moves to third with Holliday in left. The Seattle Mariners land Jason Bay, forcing them to deal Felix Hernandez before he reaches free agency. They can’t afford both. The Red Sox send prospects including Buchholz, Casey Kelly and Michael Bowden. Thankfully, they send Papelbon as well. Papelbon still has market value, but his mouth (redneck bad teeth and all), along with a historically bad shoulder, paves the way for his departure from Boston. The guy is almost 30 but acts 19 years old. And he will go to the highest bidder when he is a free agent. The Sox then have some prospects left over to land Adrian Gonzalez. <br /><br />Starting pitching on Opening Day consists of Lester, Beckett, Hernandez, Wake and Matsuzaka, that is if Dice-K doesn’t show up as the same bloated pig he was this year. (Oh, oh, is 2010 the year of the pig in Japan?) Lowell splits DH 60/40 with Ortiz, but Ortiz spends most of his last year in Boston on pine. Papi is only here to honor the final year of his contract before being nudged out of the picture by Theo at seasons’ end. Bard and/or Billy Wagner fill closing void. Wagner gets his 400th save while showing Bard the ropes. <br /><br />Changes need to be made and this is a step in the right direction. This is my wish list for the 2010 season. And it is very doable!! Of course, if neither Gonzo or Holliday comes to Beantown, that might mean a late push for Chone Figgins, which would totally screw up the lineup!Tommy Dee Boston sports becoming mediocre?Is Boston becoming a mediocre sports town? I would like to hear what you have to say about this. <br /><br />The Boston Bruins could easily be 1-4. They were picked by many to be the top team in the NHL. It looks like they believe their own hype because they aren’t playing like the top team. The Patriots could easily be 2-3 or they could be 4-1. Are they just an average NFL team now? Is Tom Brady showing signs of aging? It certainly appears that way. The Sox were the second worse team in the playoffs, behind the Twins. Sure, they had 95 wins and all, but most of those wins were due to the home crowd, due to fans like me. Atlanta, Milwaukee, Florida and more had better road records and that is not a recipe for championship baseball. The Celtics are yet to be seen, but they could be the best team in Boston over the past 18 months, by far. <br /><br />Is mediocrity taking over Boston?

2012-2013 Boys'
Basketball Focus
For the second time in seven days, Kaneland found itself scrambling to make an improbable second half comeback against a formidable Rochelle squad.
This time around, the never-say-die Knights finished the job.
Kaneland scored 8 unanswered points in the final two frenetic minutes of regulation, then tacked on the first 6 points in overtime to secure an emotional 65-61 victory in Friday night's Rochelle Class 3A regional final.
The Knights (17-10) advanced to Tuesday's Sycamore Class 3A sectional semifinal, where they will face the winner of today's Marengo regional title game between Rockford East and Belvidere.
Senior Marcel Neil calmly connected on 15 of 17 free throw attempts and finished with a game-high 21 points while sophomore Thomas Williams caught fire late, with 17 of his 19 points coming in the second half and overtime.
"We always have that fight," said Neil. "That fourth quarter we always dig deep, and tonight we hit some big shots and big free throws down the stretch."
"It was just a collective group of guys who kept fighting and fighting and fighting," added Kaneland coach Brian Johnson, who only utilized a seven-man rotation.
Kaneland trailed 30-12 in last Friday's 59-57 Northern Illinois Big 12 East loss to the Hubs and dug itself a similar 37-21 hole early in the third.
The Knights' deficit stood at 56-47 when Rochelle's 6-foot-8 defensive anchor David Newton fouled out with 2:52 left in the fourth.
Williams completed a 3-point play when he was fouled banking in a tough shot off the glass. Neil followed his own miss for another conventional 3-point play to shave the deficit to 57-55 with 1:29 left.
After a Rochelle turnover, Williams was fouled after rebounding Neil's miss and dropped in both free throws to tie the score. Rochelle (21-9) held for the last shot, but Matt Rosenwinkel missed a last second off-balance jumper.
"When we got them in foul trouble, we felt could take it to the rim for easy baskets and free throws," Williams said.
Williams' driving basket to start overtime gave Kaneland its first lead since 8-6. Drew David and Williams both hit a pair of free throws for a 63-57 lead, but Will Widick gave the Hubs life with a 3-pointer.
Kaneland was called for traveling with 11 seconds left, but Grant Prusator's potential game-tying 3-pointer from the corner came up short and Neil grabbed the rebound and was fouled with 1.1 left.
David and Tyler Heinle chipped in 8 points each for the Knights, who made 29 of 35 attempts from the line. Neil and Williams grabbed 11 rebounds each as Kaneland enjoyed a 40-27 edge on the boards.
Prusator's 14 points led the Hubs while Derek White and Newton added 11 points each.
"Kaneland saved their press for the second half again and our smaller guards had trouble with that," said Hubs coach Tim Thompson. "Then when Newton fouled out we lost our low post presence and size shifted to their favor.""

Draft Day: Feel the Excitement!
The day Kings’ fans have been looking forward to since the regular season ended is finally here. Draft day. The day when legends are made and spirits broken. I know I woke up with a little bounce in my step. A lot of people like to denigrate this great sport of ours, but I feel no shame in saying that draft day is one of my favorite days of the year. It's like Valentine's Day (but without me crying as much). Rejoice, hockey fans.
Of course, I can't say that my spirits weren't dampened a little bit by today's news that the Sharks traded Vesa Toskala. The Sharks and Ducks are supposed to be getting worse while the Kings get better, but with the Sharks possessing a first-round pick now (and the Lightning giving up a #1 pick to the Ducks for Shane fucking O'Brien), it looks like the Kings are going to be #3 in California for a little while longer.
No matter, though; today's draft day, and I'm still excited. I have a feeling the Kings will do something shocking tonight during the draft. It just seems like it's their turn to set the hockey world abuzz. But first, I wanted to ask a question: how the hell is Greg Oden only one year older than Kyle Turris? I mean, look at them:
I mean come on, Oden’s like 50 and Turris looks like he’s 12.
Anyway, the Kings continue to mystify your noble correspondent, because I have absolutely no idea what they are going to do. It is especially difficult because what the Kings do is dependant on what the three teams picking ahead of them decide. As I am wont to do, I’ll post a few scenarios that are plausible and then my bullshit idea.
The Kings Play it Safe
The Kings hold onto their pick and draft Karl Alzner, the top-rated defenseman in this year’s draft. This is more of a need pick, as it is not believed that Alzner is the 4th best prospect in the draft. However, it would fill a hole in the Kings’ system and give them a solid defensive prospect that could eventually be paired with Jack Johnson. I have a problem with this idea because it seems like the Kings would be wasting a top draft pick on a player that could be picked later. I’m not against drafting for need, but it seems foolish to do so this early in the draft. If you’re just going to play it safe, you might as well trade down. Which brings me to…
The Kings Trade Down
Rumors abound that a number of teams are looking to trade down, including the Vancouver Canucks (who currently sit at 25). As I mentioned before, the Kings have a pretty elite farm system and it could be argued that they don’t really need to improve it. They would be better off improving the current team with a younger, NHL-ready player that could step in immediately. Maybe the Kings could wrangle someone like Kevin Bieksa or Alex Burrows and the #25 pick from the Canucks in exchange for the #4 pick and one of the Kings' many other picks in this year’s draft. The problem with this idea is that there’s always the risk the Kings would miss out on a great talent by giving up a pick this early in the draft. I don’t think I could bear to watch Jakub Voracek or James Van Riemsdyk light up the Kings knowing that they could have been on the team. This brings up my next point…
The Kings Take the Best Player Available
This is my favorite option. I think the Kings would best be served by just taking the best forward they can, depending on who’s taken earlier. I personally think that the best player available in this draft is Alexei Cherepanov, the ultra-talented winger from
I know my fellow Kings fans are wary of developing another inconsistent winger from
I’m going to wait until Monday and then give a run-down of who the Kings drafted, so I hope to see you guys again then. Here's a list of prospects as rated by TSN to reference through the first round tonight. I’m not going to the Kings’ draft party (I have a feeling blogging about the Kings is sad enough), but I’ll be having my own little draft party at my apartment. (It’s not so much a party as me drinking alone, but that’s just semantics.) Have a good time tonight. This is the time of the year when every team gets better; enjoy it.

I know there are knocks on him, but that’s what makes him so intriguing to me.
Sounds eerily like what happened with Kopitar. Every GM talked himself into "yeah but he's Slovenian so clearly his stats are inflated."
I'm with you. Go with the highest upside. You can never have too many scorers.
If you think there's a chance the Canucks would trade Bieksa for a pick, you're smoking better stuff than I've got.
hahah. Oden does like 30 years old, and Turris looks like a muppet.
Bieksa is overrated.
Well, if we hold onto the pick, there is a good chance of one of those top three guys slipping to 4. PHI or PHX may decide Voracek is a better bet. If van Riemsdyk or Turris slips, I think you have to take him.
If that doesn't happen, I like Cherepanov. Either him or Voracek might be more appropriate for that high a pick than Alzner.
If we trade down, I think the hope would be to stay in the top 15 or so and try and land a defender (Alzner could slip down a number of spots, and then there's Ellerby, McDonagh and Shattenkirk still out there likely in that range). I would assume the additional return in a deal like that would likely be an aditional later pick (like a third rounder).
You mention that it's the Kings turn to "shake up the NHL", but what exactly do you think we have that anyone wants of consequence? The first is pretty much it, and I don't know if that's going to be earth shattering. We made the big draft day deal last year with Demitra.
Pretty much anyone worth a damn on our team now is either nigh untouchable or...actually that's pretty much the only option. Blake? Who would want the salary in return for declining play? We're pretty much only up for that because he has a future in the front office here and as a tutor for Johnson.
I'm getting the feeling DL is after a defender and a forward in terms of young veterans to build with. Auccoin going to CAL today could signal Stuart signing with LA as a UFA and there has been talk of Souray also (I'd prefer Stuart).
Maybe we send that first somewhere for the forward he's looking for (heard some crazy rumors we were talking to ATL about Hossa today), but it's probably more likely he's looking at Gomez or Briere as a UFA. Considering the strength of the draft and it being widely considered three players deep on the top end, I'n not sure how attractive that pick is to bring in real talent.
I'm anxious to find out how it plays out tonight. F'in Versus better not pull another boner like they did with the awards show, because I'm counting on my DVR.
Man, I'd galdly have dealt our first rounder for Vokoun...
Who the fuck is Thomas Hickey? Goddammit...
Thomas Hickey? I mean, he's a great pick around 20-30th... but why the hell did they not trade down? Wow.
Interested on hearing what you think of this pick.
DL did try and trade down but was unable to get a spot high enough to get the guy they wanted, so they went ahead and took him at 4. He says he talked to another exec with a pick between 10 and 13 whose team was planning on taking him there, so trading down too far would have meant missing this kid.
Hey, it's easy to say "who's Hickey", but two weeks ago you likely would have said "who's Kane". And after the first three picks, the field was pretty much wide open. Some teams had Hickey in their top 10, some in their top 20, some out of the first round. It wasn't just the Kings going off the consesus rankings to take the guy they thought was best. I think 4 first rounders weren't even in TSN's top 50, and plenty of guys fell pretty far.
This was a wide open draft. Everyone's first reaction is going to be about how little the earth shook, but the proof will be in the tasting of the pudding. It wasn't the safe pick, but we can't really make a call on this being good or bad until Hickey develops or one of the guys we assed on does.
I do think DL has an underlying failure here in not being able to trade down, but he probably had to trade down to no lower than 10 or 12 to get the guy he wanted (which would have made for a similar failure if he missed the guy). STL moved their pick at that position, but they were looking to move down. TOR moved their pick at that position also, but they did it to get Toskala. It doesn't look like the option was really there.
I geuss we'll see how fans react to DL as GM come July 1.

An entrancing surprise during my sojourn in Northern Italy:
After an early-morning ferry across Lake Garda from my hotel in Bardolino, on the eastern side, I set my sights on the lovely town of Gardone Riviera.
Strolling up the hill from the waterfront, I dodged raindrops in anticipation of my

Engaged as well...
Last night Jonathan Rethorn asked our daughter, Elizabeth Bayly, to marry him. We're blessed by God's provision of Jonathan for Elizabeth--he's become a dear friend to our family. Jonathan's parents, Peter and Lena Rethorn, have been friends for years and now we have the joy of sharing Elizabeth and Jonathan with them.
We rather hope for several reasons that Jonathan and Elizabeth take more than six months to arrange their wedding. If they don't, well, we have four plane tickets to Europe to sell for cheap....
It became clear that Jonathan and Elizabeth were likely headed somewhere beyond friendship last winter when Elizabeth's MacBook died in Peru and Jonathan FedExed her a new, formatted hard drive with the latest Mac OS already installed, as well as all tools for pulling the old and installing the new drive and a complete step-by-step pictorial guide to replacement.
Congratulations! How much for the tickets?
Wonderful! Love from all of us,
That is great news! Congratulations to Elizabeth and Jonathan.
Great news. Happy for both of you.
Very excited, what a great couple!
Congrats!

Before any programming, try debugging using a SOAP tool… it DEFINITELY helps save sanitiy. I got it working using SOAP UI:
You need to do the following in SOAP UI:
- File –> New SoapUI Project
- Name it “SchedulesDirect” or something the like…
- Paste in the WSDL location “”
- Check “Create TestSuite” and “TestCase”
- Expand the project, Under “xtvdBinding” there should be a “download” Web Service call stub, expand that and open Request 1
- Click the little “Auth” tab at the bottom of the Request window (easy to miss… look down next to “Headers” and “Attachments” tabs)
- Enter your SchedulesDirect username and password, then click the little green “Run” arrow at the top left of the Request window
With the initial testing out of the way as a “sanity check” on your SchedulesDirect account, you can now get started on the coding.
TMS Direct Download script
In the meantime, here’s a modified version of “tmsfetch.php” which was initially provided by SchedulesDirect as one of the official examples:
<?php $username='username'; $password='password'; $wsdl_url=''; $start=gmdate("Y-m-dTH:i:sZ",time()); //today $stop =gmdate("Y-m-dTH:i:sZ",time()+3600*24); //tomorrow (now + 24hrs) $client = new SoapClient($wsdl_url, array('exceptions' => 0, 'user_agent' => "php/".$_SERVER[SCRIPT_NAME], 'login' => strtolower($username), 'password' => $password)); $data = $client->download($start,$stop); print_r($data); ?>
-or-
Conclusion
This script provides a basic way of downloading TV data in Tribune Media Services (TMS) format. It can even provide a translation into XMLTV format (which is slightly different than TMS, but conveys all the same data); however, it won’t help much with the display of the data on the front-end. For that, I would suggest looking into one of the approved applications for actually viewing your XMLTV listings in the familiar grid/list styled EPG. While most of the software there is designed to run on the desktop, I would highlight XSLTV for web-based applications. There is not yet a mobile-friendly XMLTV application but stay tuned for my new jQuery plugin (not yet available), which should hopefully be compatible with jQuery Mobile.

New board to uncover rogue traders
The Government has announced plans to make the new Citizens Advice Service a champion for consumer information across a range of sectors and a new National Trading Standards Board.
The new Citizens Advice service will take on the responsibilities from Consumer Focus to represent consumer interests in unregulated sectors, while a new technical Regulated Industries unit will work with the energy and postal services sectors.
Despite the introduction of a new service, Trading Standards will continue to play a critical role in protecting consumers and businesses, and a Government investment of £10.5 million will help to build on local expertise and strengthen cross-boundary working mechanisms.
It is hoped that the new system will make it even easier to catch unscrupulous traders.
Consumer Affairs Minister Norman Lamb hopes that the new reforms will ensure that the UK has the right system of help, advice and protection for consumers.
He said: “For too long people have been faced with an array of different bodies for advice and support, but its not always clear who to turn to first.
‘The Citizens Advice service will become the publicly-funded voice of consumers, championing their needs and empowering them to make the right choices for themselves.
“A new National Trading Standards Board is exactly what we need to combat priority areas such as loan sharks and internet scams.”.
Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice said: “This is good news for consumers. With consumer advice, advocacy and education all under one Citizens Advice service roof, consumers will get a service they know and trust. One that helps them resolve their problem, learn how to avoid similar issues, and get involved in making sure the same thing doesn’t happen to other people.
.”
Competition authorities are set to play a key role in protecting consumers, following changes announced last month. The new Competition and Markets Authority will now be responsible for ensuring that effective competition is present across all markets in the UK economy for the benefit of consumers, whilst also allowing more effective co-ordination with Trading Standards.

Mixtapes Now A Standard Strategy
Releasing free mixtapes may have been a novel strategy a few years ago, but today, they’re standard for the rap music industry. The question is, “Can rap music artists still build and retain fan followings without releasing mixtapes?” Some artists don’t question the strategy much; mixtapes are simply part of the business and a way to put out some music outside of a full album release. Others have deliberately maneuvered around mixtapes and major labels, and have still built a solid fan base.
So, are mixtapes strictly necessary? If you talk to artists like Lil Wayne or Drake, the answer is clear. They both release mixtapes religiously and they’re massively successful. If you talk to artists like Tech N9ne and Odd Future, they don’t release mixtapes and they’re arguably very successful, too.
Part of the answer depends upon how you define “success.” From a business perspective, success is measured in dull fashion, by counting product sales and performance revenues. From a critical perspective, success is harder to define. Do you put on a good show? Do you get a lot of airtime? Is your music standard on the club circuit?
Tech N9ne and other independent artists prove that releasing mixtapes isn’t necessary to build a fan base or keep fans interested. Mixtapes provide a great way to introduce a new artist. For established talent, mixtapes are a good outlet for music that’s stylistically good, but not good enough to be featured on an album. They can also be used to promote upcoming albums without a lot of effort.
Ultimately, the mixtape comes down to this: do you want to swing for the fences on every track, or is a base hit good enough? If you want to be a home run king, it’s best to consider each song’s potential as an album and make sure it’s as good as it can ever get. If you don’t want to work that hard, the mixtape is a good way to publish music that’s better than average and keep the fans interested, but you’ll still need to deliver on your album work.

February's question of the month is inspired by Valentine's Day: "What are your favorite pink items?"
Once opposed to it, I now love pink! Well, hot pink and a soft peachy blush in particular.
Beauty
1. Viktor & Rolf La Vie En Rose - More citrus and in my opinion, much softer than the original scent. This is my second bottle and I really hope I'm never without it. This will be my wedding day perfume.
2. Revlon Colorburst Lipstick in Fuchsia - Bright and bold, but very pretty if you want a statement lip and bare face.
3. MAC Hot Gossip lipstick - I wear this on a regular basis and highly recommend it! It's a very flattering, neutral pink.
4. Orly Fancy Fuchsia nail polish - My absolute favorite nail color for hands and feet. Ever.
5. China Glaze in Shocking Pink - The ultimate neon for Summer.
6. Essie Cascade Cool - One of my favorite bloggers introduced this shade to me. It's a cool-toned pink with hints of lilac. It's very wearable.
Fashion
1. J.Crew Factory Bag - I love this for a pop of color. It's starting to get a bit stained and the natural suede does discolor after wear, but I'm still in love with it. So much so that I want another one in a different color!
2. J.Crew Mona Suede Pumps - They are an identical shade to the factory bag, but you do get what you pay for. The suede is much better quality. I've never worn the two items together, but maybe I will this Spring :)
Are any of you obsessed with pink? What are your favorite pink items?
- Alison*Elle - Alison finally found her perfect pair of boyfriend jeans.

I love all the pink!! I would rock the shoes and bag together, but make sure there are others colors in there so you're not focused on the colors being too matchy-matchy.

Things I Love
A smattering of some things I LOVE…
- Elana’s Pantry - This is a great site for Gluten Free recipes. I’ve learned so much from Elana, although I’ve never met her. She’s taught me that you can make delicious treats that are low glycemic and gluten free and still VERY delicious. I don’t know what I do without her Almond Flour Cookbook or her Gluten Free Cupcake cookbook. Thank you Elana! Maybe someday I can thank you in person!!
- Justin’s Chocolate Almond Butter - Gluten Free and Dairy Free almond butter on top of a perfectly ripe banana…who could ask for anything more. If my daughter ate a banana all by itself her BG (blood glucose) would skyrocket but adding this high fat (good fat), high fiber goodness slows the effect of the carbs.

My wonderful friends Aunt K and Aunt Texas threw me a shower last weekend. It was lovely- alphabet themed and colorful and fun.
And Aunt Texas did double duty as hostess and photographer. So the best pictures of the day are definitely hers.
And here they are!
Thank you, awesome friends! If I ever get the opportunity, I'd like to shower you in style someday!
(For those of you who either couldn't make it, don't know me "IRL," or just feel particularly generous, we still have need of a few baby items- they're on the Buy Buy Baby registry {#6231682}.)

Coconut pancake rolls/Dadar gulung is Traditional Indonesian snack that genuinely well-liked to most people in Indonesia, especially in Java. Dadar literally means “pancake” while Gulung means “rolls” (to roll).
A thin layer cake made of Pandan-flavored batter and then filled with the sweet grated coconut. The snacks are normally green color which comes from pandan leaves as it added as natural food coloring. The combination of the coconut milk and Pandan extract that hold in the batter are make the snacks extraordinary exotic!
Above all, we have so many different kind of traditional Indonesian snack which particularly called as Jajan Pasar. I made my effort and promise to my self-my family to always be presenting them as precious after the meal, as a companion to our tea/coffee or as our snacking ritual.
My husband and I both grew up with these delicious and beautiful traditional snacks.
His most wanted sweet rolls that forever charming, he says, however I should keep them go on as our sweetie which absolutely would beautify our days.

Frankly, it isn’t hard at all to make it home, perhaps if you run short of time, you could make the filling of the coconut pancakes rolls ahead, so in the next day, it would easier for you to call up a work and presenting the snack to your loved one.
I flawlessly write up the recipe of my mother’s one, as you may notice that most parents or elderly would give you a completely different measurement, such a bit of this, a bit of that, just half from quarter, somehow not to make it too thick, that should be enough for you to hold the dough and some other unique quantity, roughly timing and funny tipsy.
Well, strangely their food no doubt be the best flavor in the world, its magic!

As I only have thick coconut milk in hand so I just diluted with plain water to make specific light batter while my mother calls for only a thin coconut milk for the batter.

Cook’s Note
If using dried coconut flakes for the filling, you will need to add more water.
Truly beautiful snack, I would have difficulties eating, as it is that beautiful. Coconut filling, mmmmmm, sounds so good.
Wow thats a lovely and beautiful recipe. Very tempting
The pictures are stunning.

I love this recipe, thanks.
Have saved for another day. I just need to be able to get Pandan leaves.
Ira - you seem to know what I will be missing! We are leaving for the States in two days and seeing all the wonderful treats make me all nostalgic already. Hopefully I will get to make them once we settle in, so thank you for the recipe in advance. For now, I will have to run to the opposite street to grab a few rolls of these delectable treats!
Lovely traditional dessert! I so much love the coconut filling that I can eat non-stop!
I completely forgot to comment although I've been to this post many times drooling over this coconut & pandan dessert as well as your gorgeous photography (I was studying your styling. :-)). I am such a big fan of your work... =)
We also have many traditional sweets and fillings made from jaggery and coconut in Sri Lanka. It's truly a match made in heaven. One of my favourite Malay/Indonesian sweets are dodol. Although I haven't tasted these, your beautiful pictures perfectly convey how delicious those dadar gulungs must be.
Your photos look stunning! Wish I knew how to take photos like you. The recipe sounds fantastic as well, love the colours and love coconut!
Your photography is simply amazing! So glad that I came across your blog.

Those rejecting a future independent Palestinian state as an Iranian proxy must have missed the history lesson of the establishment of a strikingly similar small country not far away.
By Ron Ben-Tovim
In "The Revolt," his seminal depiction of the Jewish resistance against British rule in Palestine, Irgun chief and future Prime Minister Menachem Begin often returns to his interrogation at the hands of the Soviets. These references apparently are intended to counter a contemporary communist argument raised during these interrogations, that the Zionist movement was a hoax, a "puppet show," meant to divert attention from the Jews' revolutionary role in Europe and turn them into a tool for British imperialism in the Middle East.
"This talk of a State conceals the true purpose of Zionism - which is to divert the Jewish youth from the ranks of the revolution in Europe and put them at the disposal of British imperialism in the Middle East. This is the kernel of Zionism. All the rest is artificial shell, deliberately made to deceive."
Begin, of course, repeatedly balks at these claims, referencing centuries of Jewish craving to return to their historical homeland and flee from the kind of persecution and massacre made manifest at that time by the camps and furnaces of Europe.
Later, Begin repeatedly cites the deep chasm running between British imperialist objectives – for which, he said, they were more than willing to sacrifice the Jews – and the very real, heartfelt Jewish desire for freedom from both persecution and foreign rule.
In one famous metaphor, Begin tells his Soviet interrogator that the need to establish a Jewish state was not a purely theoretical ambition, one motivated by either a revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary movement, but was like saving a family from a burning house. In other words, urgent and real.
Begin is asking his Soviet interrogator to disregard for a moment the political powers at play, undoubtedly necessary for the creation of Israel, and look the hopes and dreams of real people: People that care for their children, that cry out against injustice, that find life hard, if not sometimes impossible, when lived under the specter of constant foreign occupation, exile, and persecution.
Real people that crave real self-determination.
Yet as convincing as Begin's arguments were, the tendency (typified here by the Soviets) to subjugate human needs with purely geopolitical considerations have far from disappeared from the Middle East. Indeed, they have become the official line of the State of Israel.
Objections to the creation of an independent, viable Palestinian state often run the gamut of the kind of conspiracy theories realized by Begin's interrogator, opinions made strikingly evident since peace talks with the Palestinian Authority lost momentum (if indeed such momentum ever existed) late last year.
"A Palestinian state would function as an Iranian proxy," one version of this argument goes. In another: "A Palestinian state would in effect act as a place holder, allowing weapons and terrorist groups to flow uninterrupted, putting larger cities such as Tel Aviv in range of rocket fire and closing crucial buffer zones protecting central Israel from bombing attacks."
These arguments have).
The Palestinians, they say, seek a stronghold - one erected by faceless Arabs. And once completed, one which could be filled with the kind of faceless Arabs that seek Israel's destruction, if not the annihilation of the entire Jewish people.
The beauty of Begin's nuanced commentary on the criticism of Zionism, what I would term his turn toward the human, seems completely lost on proponents of the aforementioned positions. The consequence of this blindness to a facet of nationhood so close to our own is - as the unshakable leader of the dream of an Israel on both sides of the Jordan River must have understood - tantamount to a loss of humanity. It is a faceless doctrine that crushes individual lives..
The dangers of foreign influence, whether Iranian or other, are of course real. They are, however, as real to us as the fear of Western imperialism and exploitation was real to every other country in our region over Israel's creation.
To understand that, finally, is to let go of the fears of an Iranian outpost. Not because those fears are unfounded, but because they are not what should determine how Israel treats its neighbors. To mistrust those who, in good times and bad, live alongside Israel and share its fate is to perpetuate those nefarious motivations for Israel's foundation, to prefer blind dogma over the real and the human.
This is something Begin understood, and his nearsighted followers of today do not. We must live with those who share our fate, not rely on a culture that while instrumental in establishing Israel, should have been discarded immediately after. And that is why the former prime minister remains the only Israeli leader to sign a peace deal that actually had substance, both in terms of Israel's integration in the region and its security.
Begin's vision should help us understand that as long as we refuse to come to terms with both our own desires and those of the people around us and among us, we shall never be fully here. That to be fully here is to sever the umbilical cord of dogma and start - as Begin himself did in 1979 - to live with our neighbors, whether they are truly the proxies of the Islamic Republic of Iran or not.

Facts:
Ritchie claimed injury at work. The first providers to treat him, including a Dr. Robinson and a chiropractor, requested an independent orthopedic exam authorized by Paula Insurance, the worker's compensation carrier. Orthopedic surgeon Krasner, the examiner, opined to Paula that Ritchie had suffered only a strain and needed no more treatment for any industrial injury. Paula terminated worker's comp benefits, and Ritchie failed to seek further care for 8 months despite continued symptoms, until he qualified for medical insurance, when his own physician, a Dr. Solomon, diagnosed spinal cord injury and recommended surgery. Residual symptoms were blamed on the delay, so Ritchie sued, first for malpractice, but then died of "accidental" overdose, so his family added wrongful death. The jury verdict awarded $5 million to the plaintiff against several defendants, including Krasner, who appealed. The Arizona appellate court affirmed the verdict (appellate opinion).
Duty:
Ordinarily doctors who conduct independent examinations for employers and insurance companies are not considered to owe a duty to the examinee, who is not their patient. In fact, often the questions asked of the doctor have little to do with practice of medicine. For example in worker's comp cases like this one examiners are routinely asked whether the cause of the illness or injury was work related. Such a question is rarely if ever relevant in medical practice.
In its opinion the court acknowledges that in many cases of independent examination a duty to the examinee may not exist, but upheld the finding of duty in this case apparently because Ritchie claimed that he relied upon Krasner's opinion in "deciding" not to pursue treatment with his own providers. According to the opinion "Krasner’s report prevented Jeremy [Ritchie] from seeking treatment either because he relied on Krasner’s report or because Paula relied on the report, causing it to terminate Jeremy [Ritchie]’s workers’ compensation coverage.(¶28) But it appears that Ritchie's ultimate diagnosis was delayed, not because he did not seek treatment, but because he delayed seeking treatment either because coverage by AHCCCS was delayed (because he did not qualify financially) or because Ritchie chose to spend his money on something other than a physician or health insurance. He did in fact seek another medical opinion, this time from his own physician, as soon as he obtained medical benefits under AHCCCS.
Ritchie's failure to obtain benefits was not the responsibility of Kranser or any other physician. If Krasner was negligent in opining that there was no industrial injury, for that aspect of his services his only duty, and his only dereliction of that duty, was to Paula. Only Paula should have cause of action against Krasner for such negligence. One wonders why Ritchie did not name Paula in the suit. ERISA? Some other sort of immunity?
Although the opinion may not have addressed the issue directly it appears that the appellate court allowed that Krasner's duty flowed through Paula to him by way of denied benefits. This was wrong. Doctors have no duty to obtain benefits for an individual, regardless of the nature of the relationship. The role of a physician is to diagnose and treat illness. Krasner's liability should have been limited to what would have occurred had Ritchie had access to care. This issue has become a problem in states where treating physicians must claim that a condition was work related in order to obtain reimbursement. Even though most states exclude mental-mental or stress claims, physical-mental claims (mental disorders arising out of physical injuries) commonly arise creating role conflicts for psychiatrists. Independent examiners, not treating psychiatrists, should determine causality.
Damages:
The jury may have erred in finding that Krasner's presumed negligence was the proximate cause of Ritchie's death. Ritchie's history of alcoholism and other substance abuse suggests that he had already established a pattern of ignoring directions in taking drugs he knew or should have known would be dangerous in overdose. He may also have been able to obtain the same drugs illicitly. Furthermore, it is likely that he used the drugs, or used too high a dose of the drugs, not to treat injury-related pain, but to get high. Once more this could not reasonably be blamed on Dr. Krasner. The logic in the appellate argument applying a foreseeability test is flawed. It is in fact also foreseeable that "from time to time" anyone to whom opiate agonists are prescribed will lie to physicians to obtain drugs or use the drugs to get high. This does not require negligence on the part of the prescribing physician. It is also of course foreseeable that any individual with or without a history of addiction will "from time to time" (¶26) overdose on any of a variety of drugs (obtained from any source) and die. What is particularly unjust in this case is that Ritchie's family and attorneys should receive a $5 million award while others whose family members died of overdose of the same or similar drugs receive not a penny simply because the decedent did not have the consideration to visit a doctor beforehand.
Implications for independent examiners (Good news and bad news):
The good news: HIPAA requires covered entities to provide records to examinees. Insurers often demand that examiners refrain from releasing reports, and some state statutes support that position. Examining physicians are caught in the middle. This appellate opinion suggests that independent examiners should inform examinees of important findings. In my experience most examinees obtain copies of reports eventually anyway. Making release of such records standard practice would simplify the work of independent examiners.
Of course while this sounds simple in theory, attempting to establish policies for putting this into practice raises more questions. Physicians may no longer be caught in the middle, but given that a physician intends to share a finding with an examinee, how will this be accomplished without establishing a physician-patient relationship, further muddling the line between the two roles? This could lead to reduced credibility and objectivity in examiners and, worse, sloppy attempts to fulfill the role of treating physician. Will it be sufficient to provide a copy of the report to the examinee? Standard of care may require that the physician meet face to face with a patient to deliver bad news about diagnosis, and answer questions. How will examiners accomplish this? Who should pay for the contact? How should it be documented? Will this create added duty? and added liability? Will it suffice to recommend that the examinee seek follow up care with another physician who may have access to the examiner's report?
The remedy for independent examiners:
- Warn all examinees not to rely upon the opinion.
- Warn all examinees to obtain second opinions from their own physicians.
- Professional liability premiums and worker's comp insurance premiums will increase.
- The cost of independent examinations will rise.
- Physician's fees will increase.
- Physicians will seek to avoid entanglement in similar cases by whatever means they can.
Had Mr. Ritchie applied for insurance after his injury and described his symptoms on the application, the insurer might deny coverage because of the preexisting illness or, if he concealed the symptoms, argue that he should have sought medical care for his symptoms in canceling his policy or denying coverage for a preexisting condition. Is it fair to apply a different rule where Dr. Krasner is concerned? Hardly.
As I write this Congress moves toward health care reform which could prevent cases like this. This case might never have occurred were it not for the fact that Ritchie lost his coverage, presumably while losing his job. He would not have had to prove an industrial cause of his symptoms in order to obtain care from his own physician.
Independent examiners for worker's compensation should not have to determine whether a worker will have medical insurance or not. They should determine only who will pay: the industrial fund or ordinary health insurance.

Whatcha ya'll think of this idea?
Like it. Do it. I would totally participate.
Just the other day I was thinking that I want to bring back the phrases "cool beans" and "cut. it. out." a la Full House.
I was also sleep deprived at the time.
Coincidence? I think not.
"how rude" and "have mercy"!
I would participate especially if you keep the rules kind of loose. I do some link ups when I can match a post to their topics but I'd really love something that was just a good frugal ideas without it being so strict. Besides I truly enjoy your blog and would love to share.
Loose and easy is my nickname!
Wait. No. That's not right.
But yes, it wouldn't be a strict kind of link party.
What are some of the natural food blogs that you enjoy? I have been searching for some good ones and can't seem to find a whole lot. Thanks!
I can send you some via email if you'd like to email me. Basically there aren't a lot that I "enjoy". I do get information from them, but I always feel like a piece a shit most of the time because I don't chug cod liver oil and I occasionally buy Annie's bunny crackers.
I would link up! I love link parties :)
And yep... I totally remember Jesse and the Rippers.
I didn't realize there was a cost involved with hosting...
I've done a few "link up" posts using Simply Linked and never had to pay a fee.
Just created my own button and asked my readers if they participate to include my image in their post. I must be missing something here (or I've been doing it wrong!)
With the company I was looking at, there is a cost ($24 per year). I'll look in to Simply Linked. Thank you!
I'm in. Trying to get more involved with linky parties... considering hosting our own "whole foods" weekly party as well. Or possibly just things related to natural living.
I'm in! :)
I'm IN! I think! I'm pretty new to this so as long as it doesn't require me having to actually know HTML...I'm IN!
I remember Jesse and the Rippers, but I have had to block out most of my Full House memories after seeing the movie "Half Baked" and hearing Bob Saget shout, "I've sucked d*** for coke!". That's the kind of moment that can retroactively spoil a childhood.
If you can copy and paste, you can participate in a link party!
You don't make your own olive oil?!?! O_O
I'd link in! :)
I love linky parties. Im in
I would link in!
You use OLIVE oil??? I press my own coconut oil from the organically grown trees in my yard. It's the ONLY healthy way to eat. :-) Oh wait...I live in Alabama. Nevermind....
I would love to participate in a less intimidating link party! I'm pretty sure I would be blocked from most of the sites that you mentioned. I sometimes even use things that come out of a CAN! lol (I do bake my own bread now though, so it all evens out...)
You use stuff from a can?! There must be a block feature somewhere around here...;-D

So how big was it?
Watching the attached YouTube video will tell you more than words about this giant yellowfin tuna caught off Baja, California, and Phil Friedman Outdoors has the full story. He reported the weight as 445 pounds, and writes:
"Art Soriano drove all the way from Los Angeles with his three children to watch the weigh-in.
“'How often do you get to see history being made?'” he remarked to Friedman. “'What an awesome day.'”
Other bloggers such as Pete Thomas report that local anglers and charter boat captains have been buzzing about it ever since that Dec. 3 weigh-in, which drew a crowd that chanted and cheered. But an updated weight, based on a 'tape' measure, puts the fish even heavier: 449 pounds.

Why Verizon Should Be In Your Portfolio
Joel is a member of The Motley Fool Blog Network -- entries represent the personal opinion of the blogger and are not formally edited.
Verizon (NYSE: VZ) reported yet another quarter of spectacular revenue, proving its consistency in terms of growth and performance. Its Q2 revenue is commendable at $28.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.64, up 3.7% and 12.3% respectively from the comparable quarter last year.
To talk about the future of this New Jersey based company is to talk about strong long term goals:
The company has added 134,000 fiber optic internet and 120,000 fiber optic video subscribers. Verizon has not only invested in its FIOS network, but has also cracked a precious spectrum deal for $3.9 billion after negotiations with the FCC. Spectrum, a precious and scarce resource is the key to success in the coming years for any telecommunications provider.
Verizon has been considered as the best telecom service provider given that its churn rate has dropped from 1.2% in the year-ago quarter to 1.1% .
With the advent of the tablets and with the surge in sales of smartphones, the crowd has gone berserk over doing virtually everything on the go. From downloading and surfing the internet to streaming multimedia content.
Consumers with data hungry tech devices are creating an ever increasing pressure on service providers to offer higher quality services at faster speeds.
Verizon finds itself in a favorable position as it now has a nation-wide chunk of prime spectrum which it bought from cable companies recently.
But that’s not all…
Verizon is also competing with Canada based ‘on demand’ internet streaming provider Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL) (iTunes services) by partnering with Coinstar. This deal brings additional revenues considering how big the online movie business is.
With the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, Verizon has entered into manufacturing wireless devices for vehicles. The growth prospects are huge and this deal will open up a world of opportunities in vehicle GPS, safety and entertainment and help it compete in the fields of satellite system operations, telecommunications equipment manufacturing, satellite & broadcast network, equipment manufacturing and telecommunications services.
No, it doesn’t stop here. For all those investors going gaga over dividends, the company has been gradually increasing its D/P ratio: from $0.46 per quarter to $0.50 per quarter. Verizon has been rated as one of the highest dividend paying companies.
What about the competitors?
While Verizon managed to get its paws on prime cable spectrum, AT&T (NYSE: T) was busy floundering with the T-Mobile deal which ultimately got disapproved by the FCC. Hence, Verizon is able to effectively compete today, in providing 4G LTE services.
Now I’d like to highlight Sprint Nextel (NYSE: S), which has experienced a speculative 121% rise in its share since May this year because of the billions of dollars of debt ($10 billion in net debt and almost $38 billion in total debt) that it has to service leading investors to believe the company is heading for a probable takeover. Furthermore, it has actively invested and partnered with Clearwire (NASDAQ: CLWR) which has a lot of spectrum to spare. But the problem is that Clearwire's 2.5 GHz spectrum is not of the highest quality and is a lot more prone to service disruptions.
The Foolish Takeaway
It is true that Verizon’s stock has been dipping for the past 2 months. But there’s no concrete reason to see why that should happen. Over the last 10 years, Verizon has only had 4 unsuccessful quarters. The company has shown consistency in earnings and a profit margin of over 5% in most quarters. Having said that, Verizon’s future looks great as it continues with its 4G LTE ambitions.
Verizon is definitely a good buy. Firstly because the company has a lot of growth potential, and secondly because its stock is trading at low valuations, that too topped by an annual dividend yield of 4.7%.
Sounds interesting? Well, what do you think about Verizon?

Android 4.1 extends language support, and this developer loves it [video]

You have served us well. You’ve given hope to Earthlings of all shapes and sizes, ages and interests for almost 30 years. You are the third spacecraft to join the Space Shuttle fleet, and the first to be retired. You were born on August 27, 1979 and took four years to roll off the assembly line.
You were named after two exploring ships of old. One of your namesakes carried Henry Hudson to explore the Hudson Bay in the early 1600s, searching for a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Your other namesake carried British explorer James Cook on his adventures to the South Pacific in the 1770s. On this voyage, he discovered the Hawaiian Islands.
Discovery, we thank you for taking us back to space after both our Challenger and Columbia tragedies. You were the first US spacecraft to meet up with the Russian Mir orbiting space station, and the first to be flown by a female pilot, Eileen Collins — who later became the first female commander. You returned Astronaut John Glenn to orbit as the oldest human to fly in space.
You traveled 148,221,675 miles in space for a total of 365 days off the planet. You orbited Earth 5,830 times, and gave 242 humans the ride of their lives. I’m sorry I wasn’t one of them, but I was with you in spirit as you soared through the heavens at 17,500 miles per hour.
I look forward to seeing you fly over us today as you piggyback your way to Dulles for your final retirement home at the Smithsonian’s Udvar-Hazy facility in Chantilly, Virginia. Look down. I’ll be waving wildly and snapping your photo with my iPhone.
Discovery, we love you. We’ll miss seeing you break the Earth’s gravitational boundaries. But, I know you’ll continue to break hearts (in a good way) as long lines of Earthlings come see you for the first time. Enjoy your retirement. You deserve it.
Final Godspeed to you, old girl!

Ordered 4 pairs of heels from Charlotte Russe two weeks ago after seeing a pop-up window promoting its shoes sale and received my orders this Monday. Guess what, none of them fit, either my size or my expectation. It's not my first time buying shoes online but first time shopping with Charlotte Russe, an U.S. clothing retail chain that shares the same target consumers as Forever 21 (but I personally like F21 slightly better), and I think this will be an once-an-for-all thing, won't order anything online from Charlotte Russe anymore.
Gonna return them tomorrow and right now, I'm only hoping that I'll get full refund (fingers crossed) although I already paid US$15 for the shipping & handling fee, which is definitely not refundable T____T
Since they are here with me still I might as well show you what I've bought. They may look okay in the pics but they kinda look cheap in reality...
#1
#2 Expected these to be more like a striking neon green though :(
#3
#4 Placed high hope in these. I mean, how could you probably go wrong with such simple peep-toes pumps? I was so wrong. Poor quality and the platforms are uneven, how to walk? @.@
#5 So ugly and super pasar-malam-ish! A complete eyesore. They have to go for sure!
#6
#7 Super into fuchsia color lately, I'm still thinking whether to keep this one or not. They are the most comfortable ones compared with the rest, but still I'm not totally sold...
Sigh. Really don't mind paying for the shipping fees at all but it's such a bummer that none of these heels work and thus my 15 bucks just unfruitfully went down to the drain. Maybe I'll just keep the fuchsia wedges then, argh, dunno lah.
Anyway, lesson learned. Never ever, ever buy anything online when you are shopping deprived, you will end up making impulse decisions you'll later regret.
Banging my head against the wall,
Bev

The fuchsia ones look really good. You should keep them ;) And you're lucky they accept returns in the US.
I think the Fuchsia ones look really good as well. :D
I always experience the same. Either poor quality or the shoes are not comfortable at all. But one thing is different in U.S. - things can be returned for refund.

Flowers For An Edible Garden
Posted in Garden & Gardening on April 27th, 2012
A garden that produces food does not only mean that it is growing fruits and vegetables. Planting edible plants and flowers can add color and life to your garden without reducing the number of your fruits and vegetables. It will also provide something new for your appetite. You can include them in your desserts, soups and salads.
- Nasturtiums. Nasturtiums are quick growing flowers that require little maintenance. They are completely edible that you can eat the seeds, flowers, leaves and stems. The leaves and blossoms are perfect for salads because of its somewhat spicy taste. It is packed with iron and vitamin C. The buds can be utilized as capers. Beginner gardeners can grow this flower easily because it can survive even a poor soil and can grow in little or full sun exposure. This flower needs regular water and can thrive in bare area in the garden or plant container.
- Violets. Violets are considered weeds and they grow in yellow, white and purple flowers that can be used for dessert such as jelly and salads as well. Because it is a weed, it spreads fast and easily and is perfect as ground covers. Violets are delicate flowers that need shade. It can survive full sun exposure with regular watering. There are other flowers that look like violets and are poisonous so you better be careful in eating them.
- Daylilies. This is common in almost all states in the U.S. and is considered as a happy flower. Regular watering and ample sunlight is all they need to thrive. They may grow in your garden without you knowing they exist. It is like squash blossoms that have delicate but tasty petals which is good when deep fried or battered. It is commonly used in Asian dishes but can also be included in your soups and salads. Make sure to consume them right away because they can be bad when left for so many hours. You can sauté the young buds with oil and garlic and the tuberous roots is as great as potatoes. Most lilies should not be eaten because they are not edible so make sure that what you are eating are daylilies.

The Christian bible describes a behemoth as any huge or powerful animal or thing. It is very safe to say…Well, maybe “safe” isn’t the way to put it… It is very “reverent” to describe the band, Behemoth, as a huge, powerful beast. More powerful than we have seen in a long time. Yet I’m sure that this Behemoth will not be mentioned in any Christian tomes, nor spoken from any Christians’ mouths any time soon.
As one of the acts featured on the Mayhem Festival Tour, alongside bands such as Slayer, Marilyn Manson, and Job For a Cowboy, Behemoth has opened the eyes, mouths and ears of many crowds. Their stage performance is stunningly accurate. Their music is as potent as pure LSD. Mainman Nergal is ferocious in his guitar attack, and even fiercer with his throat. Orion’s bass thunders with pure demoncy. Inferno is crushing, yet technical on the drums. Even (touring guitarist) Seth has perfect fretwork. As an added treat, they look creepier than Linda Blair at the height of her exorcism as she growls, “I can smell your cunt.” No, you will not find this type of blackened death metal as true to form, nor will you soon find a band that is as talented, as you will find with Behemoth.
Workhorses on the road, Behemoth were at an off-date in Omaha, Nebraska featuring other Mayhem acts God Forbid, The Black Dahlia Murder, and Cannibal Corpse. I caught up with Nergal to talk to him about the new album, Evangelion, and the response from the crowds on the Mayhem tour.
I want to thank my wife, Danya, for taking pictures, and John Eddy for his assistance.
[powerpress url=""]
Thank you!
Great fucking interview! I like how you asked about the art since I am a fan of wood cut artists like Gustave Dore and Albrecht Durer…I wanted to ask Nergal about the Hex-7, his signature axe from ESP but had a great conversation with Orion instead. Hails!!!

I think I'm getting addicted to the power aspect of all this!i love these aspects for sure! i got it from the same website. we need to actually talk sometime. here is the link:, so that's pretty advanced for me right now. I'm guessing I really need to focus on my technique before jumping into that or I'll hurt myself. I agree we do need to actually talk sometime! Mike's website is my new favorite!definitely! i use it more for repetition of the oly lifts to get that form down. let's talk this weekend or something and we can chat about all of this. i have done so much research on all of this, i would be happy to share :)sounds great!!

added video proof of my stubbornness and humility. i did actually get one rep of 160, but it wasn't pretty and my squat wasn't full depth...therefore, no rep. Disappointing day.well, i sorta subscribe to the same addage fishermen do. A bad day at the gym beats a good day at work anyday!!! Still amazing.Ok, I will admit, Austin and I actually started laughing at your stubborness. Loved the effort and it was WAY more than I would have given. Still great job and you looked great doing it!!lol! i know right?! i was so close i just couldn't get it done....so frustrating. 155 was no problem at all...160 has to be in my head.Yeah, that's frustrating when it's just 5lbs. You know what they say about the proverbial "straw?"

3. Bake cakes: mine all come out flat
4. Sit still (and wouldn't you know, I'm a secretary). I should be a carpenter or something

The heart of the new camera is a 33-megapixel, 48 x 36mm, 16 bits/channel CCD, which is mounted on a revolving back, which enables you to switch from portrait to landscape mode without having to reposition the camera. If you currently own an RZ system, you’ll be pleased to know the RZ33 makes full use of all existing RZ lenses, prism finders, waist-level finders, and other RZ imaging accessories.
Because the RZ33’s imaging sensor is smaller than the camera’s native 6x7 design you have to consider a 1.48x magnification factor when choosing lenses. As an example Mamiya’s 50mm/4.5 ULD wide-angle lens has an effective field-of-view of a less-wide 74mm lens, a 150mm portrait lens has the effective field-of-view of a 222mm lens, etc.)
The RZ33 records 16bits/channel RAW files that open up to 190MB, 16 bit TIFF files that display little if any artifacting and/or moiré patterns. This capablilty makes it an attractive tool for shooting beauty and fashion, jewelry, textiles, or any other subject matter that requires sharp, clean detailing. IOS levels can be set from a native 50 through 800, and frames can be captured at a rate of 1.1 frames per second.
Images are captured onto CF cards (the faster, the better), and the resulting images can be viewed and edited using the camera’s 2.4 x 2.7 inch (6 x 7cm) LCD touch screen, which is also used for selecting camera and menu settings. For processing your image files, the RZ33 comes with both Capture One DB and Leaf Capture, which are two of the finest image processing programs available today.
As with earlier generation RZ optics, you have a full range of shutter speeds from 8 to 1/400-second (and ‘T’ for time exposures up to 32 seconds) with full flash sync at all speeds, which makes the camera equally ideal for studio and location shooting alike. Another RZ feature pro shooters take advantage of is the close focusing abilities of the RZ-system with all RZ optics. And yes, the RZ33 also accepts Mamiya RZ 120/220 film backs for those who still swing both ways.

With a header like that, I have to start and say I am not so conceited as to call anything I blogged ”The One Egal Article You Simply Have To Read.”
Nope. But I want to link to a great one, by Kristen Rosser. Here is a quote from it:
…But what does it actually mean, that a woman must be restricted, under male authority? Why must she be?
Either women are not equal to men, because God created them with a certain lack of authority over themselves, or ability to lead others, that men do not lack… This makes women, in their essence as women, inferior to men…
Or women are equal to men, but God simply decided that women, because they are women, despite lacking nothing that He gave men for authority over themselves or leadership of others, may not use that authority or leadership……
I first wanted to quote the penultimate and ultimate paragraphs which are even better, but those should be read as a powerful conclusion, and I do not want to take them out of context.
Please, those who restrict women for Bible reasons, go to that short article, and think about the simple idea of justice and ”do unto others” presented in it.
Comments on: "If you read only one egalitarian article ever, read HERE" (1)
Wow, I’m honored. Thanks so much for this.

Stybar, Vos win World Championship at Tabor
After taking the World Cup, Czech Republic’s Zdenek Stybar wins the Cyclocross World Championship. Dutch rider Marianne Vos wins her third Worlds victory.
Elite Men
Racing in his home country in front of 30,000 spectators, Czech Republic rider Zdenek Stybar earned his country its first World Cyclocross elite title Sunday by conquering icy conditions and tough competition on the frozen course in Tabor, Czech Republic.
Stybar, 24, took the rainbow stripes for the first time in the third Cyclo-cross World Championship after second place finishes in 2008 and 2009. His strong performance comes only one week after a second place finish in Hoogerheide earned him the World Cup.
Runner-up Klass Vantornout finished 21 seconds behind and Sven Nys outsprinted Czechis Bina for the final spot on the podium. Stybar was unable to hold off his tears coming down his face.
“It is something incredible to win here in Tabor. It is a lifetime experience. I think that the fans were amazing. They were along the whole track and I really enjoyed,” Stybar said after the medal ceremonial.
American Jonathan Page, who took second place in the World Championships three years ago, had a promising first lap until getting stuck behind a crash involving Niels Albert, then suffering back-to-back mechanical problems in the second lap left him playing catchup for the remainder of the race, finishing in 30th.
His American teammates fared better. Tim Johnson used shoes equipped with sheet-metal screws that helped him pass other riders during running section, finishing 14th. James Driscoll finished 19th.
UCI course officials added large amounts of sand on top of the frozen course to try to make the course safer to ride, but the resulting conditions were now muddy and slippery. The icy course challenged some riders more than others, with defending champion Niels Albert dropping out of the race half way through.
In the first lap, Stybar took off, with Vantornout chasing. Stybar lost his early lead when he had to deal with a flat tire, but he caught up quickly with race leaders after exchanging his bike at a pit stop.
After three laps, Stybar jumped out of his saddle and broke away from a group made up of Vanotornout, Christian Heuele and Franics Mourey. His efforts brought him an 18-second gap that he was able to sustain for the rest of the race.
“I was fairly calm throughout, and even when I lost time and places because of a tire problem in the first lap, I stayed calm and came back without too much problem,” Stybar said in a statement. “After that, everything went very well up until the last few hundred metres: when I saw the finish line and my country’s flags in front of me, I experienced sensations that I will never forget, and I nearly lost control. ”
From the fourth lap on, a group of four riders formed behind Stybar: Nys, Vantornout, Heule and Martin Bina. Halfway through the race Stybar had the advantage of 20 seconds and the Swiss rider Heule was dropped from the chasing group.
Vantornout took off in the seventh lap, shaking BÌna and Nys, who spent the remaining lap fighting for third place. Nys managed to take the third-place finish from Bina in the final straightaway. Bina, who won the World cyclo-cross title in 2001 in Tabor, attempted to outsprint Nys but he safely held off his pressure.

Elite Women
Marianne Vos’ victory was as clear-cut as that of Stybar. After just a few meters, the Dutch rider began her flight toward her third World Championship title, after her victories in Zeddam and Hoogerheide.
In doing so, she again relegated the German Hanka Kupfernagel to second place, and her compatriot Daphny Van Den Brand – who has just won the UCI World Cup – to third.
Despite crippling leg cramps, Katie Compton, who hadn’t raced since Zolder three weeks ago, decided to attempt competing at Worlds. The pain ended up being too much, and she dropped out after just one lap.
American teammate Meredith Miller led the U.S. effort, finishing in 12th place. Amy Dombroski finished 14th.
Vos jumped ahead to an early lead on the frozen course, setting a quick pace and soloing for the remainder of the race. Kupfernagel followed and sustained a similar strong effort for a second place finish.
Her Dutch teammate, Daphny Van den Brand, had to deal with constant attacks from behind for third place.
Czech Rider Katerina Nash was one favorite to win the race, but was involved in a pileup on the first corner. She moved up throughout the race, but was unable to overtake Daphny Van den Brand for the final spot of the podium.

In other words, how many of the teams whose records are in the top five of 54-game winning percentages go on to the playoffs? How many of the teams in the top ten slots wind up in the post-season?
When we take it down to the top ten, 71% of those teams make the playoffs.
The team that has won the World Series over the past sixteen years has had an average won-loss record in the first third of the season that is just a hair under .600. Only one team (the 2003 Marlins) has posted a sub-.500 record over the first third of the year and gone on to win the Fall Classic.
But there are some other interesting tidbits. Teams that have the best 54-game record but fade away and don't make the post-season (as shown in the column marked "+54, -162") actually play a tad bit better than the eventual World Series winnners during the first third of the year (.603 to .599). Teams that languish in the first third of the season and rebound from that point onward (as shown in the column marked "-54, +162") break out into two distinct groups: those who make the playoffs play a good bit closer to .500 (.463) than those who don't (.414).
So it clearly doesn't pay to fall too far behind in the first third of the season...only the 2009 Rockies and the 2005 Astros had truly rough starts and were able to lift themselves into the playoffs.
What about the rest of the season? How does the "last 108 games" look in terms of this formulation? Well, it's probably not surprising to find out that the level of certainty for teams in the Top Five and Top Ten of WPCT over two-thirds of a season is extremely high.
Teams with a WPCT in the Top Five over the last 108 games make it to the playoffs in just under nine out of ten cases (89% to be exact). Teams in the Top Ten are a bit better (91%). The aggregate winning percentage, however, declines a bit, down to .587--which makes sense given the long haul of the season. We've been on a streak of sub-par performances for World Series winners in this area over the past six years--only one team (the 2009 Yankees) has played really well in the last 108 games.
Conversely, you might wonder what type of indicators are in place when we go down into smaller sample sizes. We took a look at slices of the season at the one-sixth (27 games) and one-ninth levels (18 games). Those results can be seen below.
What we see is that the level of correlation drops a good bit, but it seems to stabilize when it gets down into these smaller slices. Yes, we are going only on one year's worth of data for these, but the aggregate percentage of Top Five and Top Ten teams in any given "sixth" or "ninth" slice seems to stabilize at or around 55%, though the totals do move around a good bit from slice to slice.
There's an interesting little reversal in the WPCT distributions for these slices. 27-game slices tend to tip toward teams that play a bit under .500, while the 18-game slices go the other way. The distributions are not uniform in nature, since the average WPCT in each category isn't necessarily that orderly, but it's still striking that the tilt in each slice is so dramatic between the teams that play .500-.599 ball and those who post WPCTs between .400-.499.
It's interesting to know that a team that makes the Top Five in WPCT over an 18-game period has more than a 50% chance of being a playoff team. We wouldn't necessarily think that to be the case, but there it is. We'll take a look at the teams who fit that definition in 2011 in just a few days from now.

Texas Rangers Comb Through Hailey's Belongings-->
By: Priscilla Luong
Updated: January 7, 2011
"It's frustrating that it's been nine days," said Billie Dunn, Hailey's mother, "but I know that they're working hard, and they're working long hours."
But still no sign of the missing girl.
"I want Hailey to know that I just want her to walk through the door," said Dunn.
Texas Rangers also spent the day giving several polygraphs to people including Shawn Adkins, Hailey's mother's boyfriend who was the last person to see her alive.
"Those tests are going to be helpful, and the if the investigators trust them, I trust them," said Dunn.
Nine days ago, Adkins says Hailey told him she was going to her father's house, then to a friend's house down the road, but on Tuesday night's episode of the Nancy Grace SHow, it was revealed that bloodhounds, traced Hailey's scent to the Western Suites Hotel.
"I heard that they traced her to the front door of our hotel," said Bonnie Lane, who works at the Western Suites Hotel, and once coached Hailey in softball.
Many people believe a hotel so close to the highway poses a red flag, but Lane says it's still a lead.
"It shows that there's hope," she said, "I just pray that someone will come forth and say something,"
As authorities narrow down the persons of interest in the investigation, all eyes turn to Colorado City.

Child Dislikes Riding Bus because of Bullying Off School Premises
By: Marlisa Goldsmith
Updated: November 8, 2012
Some, however, are running to get away from problems on the bus.
"He's real hesitant to get on the bus and real hesitant to leave out the door in the morning. You know, just real hesitant to do anything that has to do with the bus, and he used to love buses," says one mother.
Five-year-old Michael says he has been getting bullied on the bus ride to and from his elementary school.
"They're big kids," Michael explains.
He is scared because the kids he says are picking on him are twice his age and twice his size.
Megan continues, "I've talked to the principal several times and it's just not working. It keeps going on, it keeps going on, it keeps going on."
Michael says he's not the only one.
"They say bad words to other people and they hit them," Michael continues.
Micheal's grandmother says she wants the best for her grandson but is running out of options.
"I just get frustrated. I just want to take him and not let him ever go anywhere but I can't do that realistically.They have to go to school, they have to learn," says Kim Hosier.
The family says something needs to be done about the issue of bullying... And it needs to be done soon.
"Maybe there will be less kids committing suicide because of bullying. Maybe there will be less kids coming home crying because they got hit," says Kim Hosier.

Smart Woman: Heart Healthy Meditation
By: Maxine Ridling
Updated: November 14, 2012
Study participants who meditated for 20 minutes, twice a day, over a five-year period were 48 percent less likely to have a heart attack, stroke or die as compared to African American heart patients who did not meditate.
The non-meditating group attended a health education class. They were told to engage in heart-healthy behaviors at home for at least 20 minutes a day, such as exercising, preparing healthy meals or relaxing.
In the end, those who meditated also lowered their blood pressure, along with their levels of stress and anger.
Researchers say transcendental meditation appears to be a "technique that turns on the body's own pharmacy to repair and maintain itself."
While this study was looking at African Americans specifically, anyone can benefit.
Experts say that transcendental meditation may reduce heart disease risks in healthy people as well.

Bulldogs Prepared for Close Games
By: Eric Boynton
Updated: February 25, 2013
Now they have their sights set on the regional quarterfinals. Wylie has been blowing past just about every team this year. Since district, they are winning games by an average of 35 points a game, but head coach Russell Perkin's team knows it's going to get tougher as the playoffs continue.
"Those are the games we look forward too. We don't look forward to the teams we know we're better than. We're looking forward to getting better than the teams we know are ranked, and are good. That's something we look forward too," said senior guard Patrick Walker.
"I think that starts with coach and bringing the intensity, and knowing it's not going to come easy. I mean everybody is going to show their best in playoffs and especially against us," said senior forward Duane Hopper."
The Bulldogs take on Seminole next in the playoffs. The Indians beat Monahans by 5 points to advance. Wylie and Seminole meet in Big Spring at 7.

Now how bad can it be for a president to be criticised by a monarch who is alleged to have asked the Americans to bomb Iran and whose countrymen are still thought to be one of the leading donors to terror organisations like Al-Qaeda? Well, that's what the recent US intelligence documents uploaded on WikiLeaks suggest.
To a lot of Pakistanis, the leaks were a big fat disappointment. For example, a colleague of mine was wagging a finger at me saying, 'NFP, these new leaks will expose your president in the worst way possible.' He was 'my.

I was riding my Specialized Sirrus down Lovejoy a few months ago when my front fork snapped on both sides. I was thrown forward landing on my right arm. i had a bad compund fracture, after two surgeries they were able to secure the bones with a couple metal plates, but i haven't been able to return to work since, and don't know if I ever will be able to. I realize that anything can be faulty, but I have to say my next bike purchase definitely won't be a Specialized!!!

Nadine Dorries, poster-girl for the Christian Right, and hate-figure for just about everyone else, has been attracting even more flack than usual in the last day or so, always supposing that such a thing is possible, for her success in persuading the Department of Health to to back the campaign to ensure that women seeking abortions are offered advice that is “independent” of agencies that also conduct terminations. The claim is that there’s a financial conflict of interest if an organisation which charges for abortion services (charges not to the woman in question, usually, but to the health service that purchases the care) is also giving advice to women wondering what to do about an unwanted pregnancy. For a government generally committed to “one-stop shops” and critical of disjointed service provision in which several agencies are taking on different parts of a single service, this conversion to a sort of “fire-wall” between advice and subsequent care is a little odd.
But it’s not odd, because it’s a smoke-screen. The debate is not really one about formal independence, but one about the rights and wrongs of abortion per se. And insofar as independence comes into the debate at all, the independence in question is not financial, but ideological. Anti-abortionists want advice to be independent of those who believe that abortion is a right, a matter only for individual women and the choices they wish to make. Pro-abortionists want advice to be independent of those who believe that abortion is morally wrong. Both sides are dissembling, engaged in a skirmish about a technicality because we’re not able to have an open debate. It’s simply not possible to think about the rights and wrongs of abortion, its tensions, its moral and social dilemmas, without being accused either of moral decadence, or (if you’re a man, at least) misogynistic and reactionary authoritarianism.
That’s not all. The debate about abortion has become embroiled in other debates, most notably about homosexuality, that the Christian Right are also obsessed about. The antics of Nadine Dorries and her crew are for Christians what the Stalinists were for communists. Anyone who, like me, is open about their Christianity has to spend most of their time distancing themselves from a variety of crack-pot notions that are not only unpleasant, but very unchristian to boot. So, for the avoidance of doubt, I do not believe that homosexuality is a sin, nor that abortion is always wrong. Which doesn’t mean that it’s always right.
And there’s the rub. Absolutism is pretty much always wrong, dangerous and unhelpful. I don’t distinguish between the absolutism of the Roman Catholic Church, and the absolutism of those who claim that in abortion it is only and always about a woman’s individual right to make whatever decision she sees fit. Absolute truths are generally absolutely mistaken. The idea that a fertilised human egg is already a person is fanciful, and to pursue that fancy in the face of a woman who does not want to continue the pregnancy no matter what the circumstances (abusive relationship, rape, foolishness even) is entirely unreasonable. On the other hand, to suggest that an individual woman has no responsibility to wider society, is entirely free to do whatever she likes, is to flirt with an individualism that is reminiscent of Thatcher’s infamous denial that society exists at all.
We are all members one of another. We have responsibilities to one another that transcend our individual desires. To be sure, the desire of a woman not to have a baby requires a very high standard of proof indeed if it’s to be over-ridden, but that doesn’t make it impossible in principle. Ultimately it is not a woman’s right to choose. It is society as a whole’s balance between competing rights that must prevail, in this as in anything else that affects others beyond the individual. By making it impossible even to question, for example, the maximum legal limit on abortion without accusing the questioner of being some kind of oppressive ogre bent on crushing women and returning them to back-street abortions, we disable debate on things that matter to us all.
I have no right whatsoever to impose my religious commitments on you. None. But I am a member of this society, and I’m entitled to raise questions without being abused, or accused of supporting things I do not support. So, for the record. I support abortion in principle. I worry about the balance between foetal viability and the legal maximum for abortion. I do not believe that the balance is a matter only for the woman in question. There. I’ve said it. A woman’s right to choose is not an absolute right. String me up if you want to. And Nadine Dorries is still an idiot.
I think you’re going to have to justify your entire penultimate paragraph if you want to avoid being labelled as an oppressive ogre.
In what circumstances would you over-ride a woman’s desire not to continue with a pregnancy? What standard of proof would you need?
What is the “competing right” that society has to balance? You’ve indicated it can’t be the foetal right to life which is the standard for the pro-life movement, so you need to articulate this right, and from where it derives.
The major problem when moderates and liberals say that we’ve got to be able to talk about these things is that we do it so nebulously we give the extremists carte blanche. By raising the possibility that a woman’s right to decide whether to undergo a legal medical procedure is not actually her decision but society’s, you leave an open goal to Dorries and her ilk.
Rather than society, how about we let biology decide? The current legal limit on abortion is predicated on natural viability and foetal development. If medical science created an artificial womb that could develop a foetus from conception to term, would that mean the limit for abortions should be 0 weeks? I think not. There is a difference between natural viability and intervention by medical science; we cannot alter the length of gestation, and the time limits as they stand reflect that.
On the topic of smokescreens, what thoughts on the likelihood that the “independent counselling” is simply a delaying tactic to ensure some women hit the time limit?
At the risk of being pedantic, as an individual I would not presume to be able to “over-ride a woman’s desire not to continue with a pregnancy”: such a constraint must be mediated by society at large. However, I think you mistake the source of “rights” when you imply that only individuals can have them. There are many people who are discomforted by late abortion, and lots of us do not support Dorries in this or in anything else. Society has already set limits, and I think that those limits are open to change as viability changes. The issue of natural vs artificial womb is irrelevant. Even an artificial womb is not going to produce a viable 10-week foetus. I believe that if society at large were to find abortions earlier than the current legal limits to be unacceptable, than society’s right to determine those limits would over-ride an individual woman’s right to choice. To establish what “society at large” finds acceptable we need a debate that’s more open to challenge of all kinds than we currently have. Just because some very undesirable characters want to join in the debate is hardly a cogent reason for not having it.
I have not disposed of foetal rights in what I wrote: I’ve disposed of the person-hood of a bunch of cells derived from a fertilised egg. I do think that foetal rights are a very difficult problem, and one which can’t be dealt with simply by denying that they exist. At some point between conception and birth we have, I think, to accept that something qualitative has changed. You say, “Let biology decide.” I agree, but biology is not independent of human intervention. A moment’s thought exposes that argument as ridiculous. Left to “nature” many people would die who, as a result of medical intervention, do not in fact die. We’d hardly be justified in killing them because biology left them unviable, would we?
Finally, if independent counselling is merely an expedient to make abortions illegally late, then it’s pretty obviously wrong on every count. I can’t see into the souls of its proponents though, so I can’t help you there!
Why are we debating abortion? The number of abortions remains stable whether or not they’re legal. The only difference is more women die when abortion is illegal. The decision to abort or not is made in private. I should think that, short of a medical emergency, very few women choose to abort late in their term. Logic would lead one to believe that the decision is made soon after they find they are pregnant.
I find it arrogant that some seek power over the decision against the woman’s wishes especially since children are not well treated in this country and mothers have little support. I don’t recall anyone celebrating all motherhood or every childhood in any meaningful or egalitarian way. A lifetime of criticism awaits.
The only impact abortion law can have is whether we protect women or kill women. That is the debate.
For the record, because of the above, I find the “pro-life” tag offensive and misleading in the extreme.
You won’t find the expression “pro-life” in this or any other thing I’ve written, so whilst I agree with you, I’m not sure it’s relevant here.
If you can find the merest scintilla of a suggestion from this post that I support the idea of making abortion illegal, I’d be interested to know where. I do not. And to imply that I do is exactly the kind of misuse of argument that I’m trying to point out. It may well be true that women would not choose to have a late abortion, and certainly I’m not suggesting otherwise. It seems to me that if we had better abortion services more readily available earlier in pregnancy, then late abortion would be less of an issue. Presumably women would welcome that too.
All I’m arguing for is the right for society to determine the limits, and to change them for lower limits if medical advance changes the point of foetal viability. And my right to have the temerity to raise the issue without people accusing me of wanting to criminalise abortion, to oppress women, or any other fantasy about me.
Is that OK?
No Billy, it isn’t OK. Changing the limits downwards will only drive more women to seek illegal abortion. It still doesn’t have any impact on the abortion decision.
You have yet to explain how you would have the state stop women from seeking abortions if that’s their decision. How exactly would the “rights of society” be enforced? Place all pregnant-above-the-legal-limit women in special prisons? Or just some women? What would the criteria be? Explain yourself.
Also, it seems you apparently have zero conception of the pressures on women or you wouldn’t be wanting to add another. Did you know the leading cause of death for pregnant women is murder? Or that, as it is now, in some states, if a woman doesn’t deliver a perfect baby, she may be arrested in the maternity ward because she must have done something criminal, careless or desperate: taken drugs, had too much to drink, fallen down, tried to kill herself, etc. Women who miscarry are equally at risk. Motherhood carries with it the threat of prosecution for all manner of things until the child turns 18.
It’s not much better for children. They’re funneled into the military or private prisons or some other service to the the global financial elites as the environment crumbles around us. No real jobs but fodder is always needed. The federal guarantee of a “free, appropriate education” is a horrible joke. Our tattered education system is nonetheless under attack from all quarters. How many children have you adopted or fostered? Does the ‘right to life’ end at birth?
I really think you are seriously out of your depth. “Ultimately it is not a woman’s right to choose” is where you come unstuck. I also think your argument is in reaction to a non-problem. I am not aware of a crush of women demanding late-term abortions. If you have the statistics that reveal such a problem, please publish them. I do think your post is “rubbish”. If you choose to believe that opinion is “easy” and “abusive” as you tweeted earlier, then we have a difference of opinion. Trying to narrow the reactions to your post to those that make you feel comfortable is what limits the debate. Trying to discuss the issue without awareness of the larger societal issues women face limits the debate.
If you spent your time and energy achieving the goal that every pregnant woman, all mothers and their children have, not just real support and safety, but are celebrated in this society I would listen to your abortion rights arguments. But I think you’ll find that they have become moot.
You seem to want to take issue with everything except what I’ve actually written. You put up a series of arguments that I haven’t made, and then knock them down again. This has nothing to do with what makes me “feel comfortable”; you needn’t be so concerned on my behalf!
It just so happens that I agree with almost all the points you raise, which isn’t especially surprising since I never disputed them. And just to be absolutely clear, I’m not recommending prison; I utterly abhor conscription; and I’m not remotely sympathetic to the right-wing would-be theocrats that seem to infest the United States, where fortunately I do not live.
Your argument with me seems to add up to this: because I have raised one issue amongst many in the abortion dispute, my position must be false because I haven’t discussed every one of the other issues. And where I’ve not offered a view, you’ve kindly filled in the blanks with a caricature of some crazy people’s views, and then ascribed those views to me. Forgive me if I don’t accept that attempt to smear me.
You do raise one very fair and important point. What is to be done if the legal limit for termination is exceeded? Of course, that problem exists now since there’s already a limit. I have not created that problem simply by pointing out that if the gestational age at which a foetus is viable falls, we should not simply ignore the moral dilemmas that raises merely because it’s inconvenient. In any individual case, we need to proceed with compassion, and that may well include not pursuing the letter of the law, just as we currently do with “mercy killings” which are technically murder. As in most legal development, I suspect it would need to proceed by case-law and precedent. So no, remarkably enough, I don’t recommend special prisons. What would you do? Just ignore the problem and hope it goes away?
And of course the best answer, as it is now, is to ensure free, easy, compassionate access to quality counselling and abortion care as early as possible to minimise the issue of late abortions that no-one in their right mind wants to see anyway.
It is possible to have a reasoned debate, albeit that you think it’s an unnecessary one. In focusing on the issue of maximum time limits for abortion, I do not pretend that there are no other issues. I’m also sorry that if, in raising this issue, I have one small area of overlap with people that in every other respect I have no time for. It’s embarrassing, I accept, but it hardly makes me one of them.
not sure how an individual woman has a responsibility to wider society to carry a child to term that she doesn’t want?
I don’t think that’s quite how I’d express it. Society has already set limits to abortion (in lots of areas, but here I’m specifically talking about the limit to how far a pregnancy can continue and abortion still be lawful) and I think society has the right to do that because this is both an intensely personal issue and a public one. The admittedly narrow point that I’m making (but I believe an important one nonetheless) is about how society should respond to medical advances, specifically in the case of foetus viability. I think this is a legitimate matter for public debate, and that there are matters other than “a woman’s right to choose” that come into play.
My concern over the Dorries furore is that the reaction from some quarters seems to be saying that even to raise questions about abortion is somehow an affront. I don’t agree with that. I’ve made it clear that I’ve no time for Dorries: but equally I’ve no time for the notion that because she is a pretty offensive and hypocritical person, anyone who dares to wonder about the current state of abortion law and care in this society must also be offensive and hypocritical. It feels like a kind of collective punishment!
Society has the right, and the responsibility in fact, to set the legal framework for abortion, and women have to operate within it, even if they might also seek quite legitimately to change it. Only in that sense does an individual woman have “a responsibility to wider society”.
aah, now I see. Thank you for going so fully into my point and yes, I agree that it is for society to set the time limits and for these to be observed.
Hats off to you for a genuinely brave post for someone in left leaning circles. Frankly I usually keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to be associated with the conservative right yet I feel so distant from the abortion on demand position…
I think that the tone of some of the response you have received here but especially on Twitter demonstrate the validity of your assertions.
Regarding unfettered rights how do people feel about only wanting a termination because the mother wants a baby boy? It’s hardly a mere hypothetical scenario either

I thought all 5 series have the alumimum calipers. Is the different brake setup in the 540iA and 540i a misprint?

An Italian Groundbreaking
Novozymes partner Mossi & Ghisolfi Group conducted the groundbreaking ceremony for a 13 MMgy multifeedstock cellulosic ethanol plant in Crescentino in northwestern Italy in April. Production is set for 2012. Novozymes, the world’s largest producer of industrial enzymes, has collaborated closely with M&G for the past couple of years and will supply the enzymes for the plant. Poul Ruben Andersen, marketing director bioenergy at Novozymes, says,  coproduct extracted from biomass during the ethanol production process, is burned in an attached power plant that also feeds excess electricity back to the grid. The plant will employ approximately 100 people and generate many more jobs in the local community.

I see less printing happening at my office as well. Partly it’s the inconvenience (my company has so reduced the number of printers that they are “far away” and you have to sift through everybody else’s stuff to find yours. (Which of course is an excellent way to find out what’s going on, but I digress… ) So using the printer at work wastes time. On top of that, printing less material is the new normal. It’s all what you’re used to, and we’ve become used to working paperlessly. JJC— Jil Cherpack
ray will it make sense to purchase a new printer every time the ink runs out because the ink is for more money than the printer.— kel
If printing pictures is not why you have a home printer, don’t forget that you can get a home laser printer (printing in black and white) for $100-$150. A toner cartridge for my home printer costs about $70 and lasts about a year. I don’t print very much, but at least the “ink” doesn’t dry out.
And, black-only laser printers are faster and usually have better resolution than ink-jet printers. I gave up on the only home ink-jet printer I ever had because the ink kept drying out since I don’t use it every day.
An inexpensive home laser printer is a better choice than an ink-jet for many people.— David Walker
I agree. The advanced technology brings us a lot of convenience also brings the environmental problem. We may use the electronic sources more often to reduce the use of printers.— lucie

As I mentioned yesterday, I accidentally left my current cartoons at home so I'm using stuff that is on my laptop, hence the date of this cartoon.
This is one that never ran in the papers because it was feared that people with OCD would rise up against newspaper editors all across the land and cause trouble for me. One might be tempted to say, "Don't give in, Dan. To hell with them if they can't take a joke." But editors don't like losing a day of work answering angry emails, letters and phone calls and may decide to replace Bizarro with a less controversial clone. That would be bad for me. So this isn't really censorship as much as it is my personal editor advising me against it and me agreeing.
I experienced a bit of this last week when I ran a cartoon about dyslexia. I didn't lose any papers over it (that I know of), but some folks complained. I have OCD and dyslexia in my family (and a touch of OCD myself) so I feel I have the right to poke a little fun at me and mine. Humor is an age-old human device for getting through tough times and situations, so I am not as sensitive about it as many people apparently are. God knows that vegans get regularly grilled in humor venues of all kinds, but I take it with grain of salt (or a salt lick) and laugh at myself and my kind. My folks taught me that. Laughing at ridicule and teasing takes the fun out of it for the other guy, and the sting out of it for you.
The blog is good for this kind of cartoon, which will likely never see wider publication. Glad I had this opportunity to share it with you, hope no one has taken time off from checking the door locks and stove handles to get offended.

Vegans getting grilled, heh.
I laughed! But then again, I have UPLS, uncontrollable pathological laughing syndrome.
Most cartoonists have OCD anyway
I think our society is getting out of control with people taking offense. Of course, I say that only until someone says something way offensive and then I think our society is getting out of control with people saying offensive things. Sometimes people are stupid and sometimes stupid people say stupid things. Apart from all that, though, I thought the comic was very funny and was not poking fun in a malicious manner.
It's weird, how people don't get humour. Or they get it until it's about them and they forget that it's not for real. I don't think anything is off limits, I might not like it, it might suck, I might even be offended, but it's not off limits.
I was offended once when I saw a black stand-up comedian making jokes about being black in Sweden and picking apart myth after myth. Then he went over to making fun of eastern european (like me) pilots, but only building the jokes upon prejudice (stupidity, illetarcy, alcoholism), and not conterclaiming them once. In contrast to his anti-racist theme I was offended by his hypocracy. The jokes themselves were only old.
Some of the best jokes are funny because they're true. And I think the more truth a joke has, the more (some) people get offended. Some people just can't handle the truth, I guess.
motto of the day - laughter is life...god knows in what order your cartoons they run...the sj-r ran a substitute cartoon today. BUT like i said i came to your cartoonery late so i enjoy the old one too.
I'm so weary of, "As long as *I* laugh, it's funny. If I'm not laughing, then you shouldn't, either."
Blarh.
This was funny. I've got mild OCD and I GET IT... as do my other friends with OCD. Some people are just strung waaaay tooooo tight. BOOORING! Sheesh! If only people put all that unused energy towards something worthwhile...
I've always appreciated your weekly reminder e-mails to check this blog, but now I don't even need them! Great blog, outstanding commentary, nonpareil cartoons!
i concur!
it made me giggle because i want to hang that sign in the bathroom at work hoping it will make more people actually wash their hands. (yuck!)
aside from not washing at all, my (gross) favorite is the person that answers their cell phone in the stall and, while still on the phone, they go to the sink and merely rinse the fingertips on their free hand. no wonder cell phones are so nasty, right?
i generally open the door with the paper towel and toss it to the trash from the door so i don't have to touch their yuckiness.
anybody queasy yet?
Strange how people can be so sensitive. Still, the line between humour and being offensive is very thin, grey and random.
Even if I have a hint of OCD I still find this cartoon very funny. :-)
I have major OCD and I laughed out at this.
Now ask me how many times I had to spell and respell the word verification before I accepted it and pressed "Publish Your Comment."
HAHAHA! Checking door locks and stove handles! Because that's what they do! HAHAHAHA! That's some low-level humor there, Danny. Try aiming for funny next time.
=v= I am terribly offended and must leave a comment. Hundreds and hundreds of times.
I have OCD and I loved this toon :)
Maybe it's all the soy protein that gives us such tough skin.
In any case, the idea of an OCD uprising in hilarious in and of it self.
Great Comic! You can get lost in it.
Ha! Just imagining all of the people who have OCD uniting and rising against makes me laugh.
"Oh no! I have to go back and make sure I put out food for my cat before I start this riot!"
BTW - I have OCD and this made me laugh.
I have OCD and thought the cartoon hilarious. Especially since my handwashing is the worst part of my compulsion.
I don't think the joke about OCD was done in bad taste at all.
Sometimes I think people complain about these things just because they want to make a noise.

I have been reading a lot about how OAuth works. For me, where my projects are in Java, what turned out to be the best way to learn about OAuth was articles by Xiaobo Yang. Here’s the link to the first of three: “Accessing social networking Web sites through OAuth“. I worked through the examples in the first two articles.
What I liked:
- The author explains OAuth very well, especially the overview of OAuth and why you should use the OAuth protocols.
- The examples are easy to follow. He builds just what you need to see it work.
- There are many screenshots, and that makes it easy to see when you’ve taken a wrong step.
The only thing you need to watch out for is the version of Twitter4j that you get. Since the time the article was written, Twitter4J has changed. I was worried that I might have to work out how to upgrade to the new version. I found that the sample code from Mr. Yang worked just fine even though some of the methods it used in Twitter4J were deprecated.
My thanks go to Mr Yang and the developers of Twitter4J.

WWE WrestleMania 28: 5 Reasons Why Triple H Will Crush Undertaker
One of the biggest matches going into WrestleMania 28 is Triple H vs. the Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. It would take several attempts by the Undertaker to even get Triple H to agree to this match.
But has the Undertaker bitten off more than he can chew? Triple H left him pretty beat up at last year's WrestleMania, and it would take the Phenom more than a year to recover.
Triple H on the other hand has been much more active since there last confrontation at WrestleMania 27. We know that Triple H is in good shape, but how much has the Undertaker actually recovered?
The Undertaker was able to get the victory over Triple H last year, but this time it will be much, much different.
Here are five reasons why Triple H will crush the Undertaker at WrestleMania 28.
Hell in a Cell Record
Triple H sent Cactus Jack through the ring in his first Hell in a Cell match.
Do you know how many times Triple H has lost a Hell in a Cell match?
Once.
Triple H has faced the likes of Mick Foley, Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels and even Chris Jericho in Hell in a Cell matches. He would defeat all of them, and would finally be handed his first and only loss by Batista in 2005, five years after the Game's first Hell in a Cell match.
Undertaker on the other hand has lost a total of four Hell in a Cell matches. Even though Hell in a Cell in the Undertaker's match (he would first debut in it going against Shawn Michaels in 1997) Triple H is clearly the King of Hell in a Cell.
When these two superstars clash at WrestleMania 28, Triple H is going to show the Undertaker why he thrives in the cell.
Triple H Is Not Intimidated
Try as he might, the Undertaker doesn't scare Triple H.
Every year around WrestleMania time the Undertaker plays the same mind games to try and intimidate his opponent. He comes out in complete darkness, rolling his eyes backward, and in general just tries to scare his opponent before their WrestleMania match.
It's a huge mental advantage going into WrestleMania. However this year it didn't work.
Triple H was not at all intimidated by the Undertaker's dark entrances or his promos. For a couple of weeks he was ignoring the Undertaker, and denying him the match he so desperately wanted.
The Undertaker would then try to get under the Game's skin by comparing him to Shawn Michaels, and telling him that he was afraid he couldn't do what Michaels couldn't do.
Instead of intimidating Triple H, the Undertaker enraged him.
With the mental advantage now lost, and a Triple H determined to prove he can do what Michaels couldn't, can the Undertaker survive this Hell in a Cell match?
The Sledgehammer
Triple H is extremely dangerous with his trusty sledgehammer.
The Hell in a Cell structure is a weapon in itself, but when you throw in other objects like chairs and sledgehammers, the match goes from dangerous to deadly. Being able to use these weapons effectively, and being able to take the pain that these weapons cause can be a huge factor in a Hell in a Cell match.
Triple H is no stranger to dealing out, or receiving pain.
In his first Hell in a Cell match for example, Triple H would have a 2-by-4 wrapped in barbed wire grind on his head by Cactus Jack (Mick Foley). He would however also use that weapon against Cactus, hitting the hardcore legend repeatedly with the weapon.
But that 2-by-4 is the least of the Undertaker's worries. As we all know by now the sledgehammer is Triple H's weapon of choice.
The Game was about to use the sledgehammer on the Undertaker at last year’s WrestleMania (before being pulled into the Hells Gate Submission), and more recently fought Kevin Nash in a sledgehammer ladder match at the TLC Pay-Per-View last year.
Weapons, more specifically the sledgehammer, will more than likely be used in this WrestleMania 28 match. Triple H has a high tolerance for pain, but what about the Undertaker?
Will the Deadman be able to survive a beating once Triple H gets his hands on his signature sledgehammer?
WrestleMania 27
Triple H may have lost the battle, but he won the war.
At last year’s WrestleMania the Undertaker was able to lock in the Hells Gate submission and force Triple H to tap out. He was able to push the streak to 19-0. The Undertaker however had taken a massive beating. He was left helpless in the middle of the ring when the match was over.
Triple H on the other hand, was able to walk away.
He went so far as to hit the Undertaker in the head with a steel chair, something that took a lot of us by surprise. Triple H was about to use a sledgehammer to put the Deadman down but was pulled into the Hells Gate submission.
The Undertaker still remembers the beating he took at last year's WrestleMania. He remembers the embarrassment of being left motionless in the middle of the ring. Now these two enter a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania 28, which is a much more dangerous environment than last year's match.
If Triple H was willing to go as far as he did last year, imagine how far he will go this year in the cell.
The Undertaker Is Running on Empty
How much longer can the Undertaker continue?
It would take a full year for the Undertaker to recover after last year’s WrestleMania match against Triple H. He is of course getting older, and it is clearly becoming an issue.
With that in mind, how much longer can the Undertaker really last?
Hell in a Cell is an extremely demanding match. Triple H himself is getting older, he is 42 compared to the Undertaker's 47, but we know that Triple H can still wrestle. Last year Triple H wrestled some demanding matches against CM Punk (no DQ match) and Kevin Nash (Sledgehammer match) and would win both of them.
But what about the Undertaker?
As mentioned before the Undertaker was gone for a whole year after WrestleMania 27. Hell in a Cell will be a much more dangerous, and exhausting match than the previous one these two superstars had. We really don't know what type of shape the Undertaker is in, and how much longer he can last.
Triple H still has a lot of fight in him; the Undertaker however might be running on empty.

Pittsburgh Penguins: Should They Have Overpaid for Jaromir Jagr?
The Pittsburgh Penguins get ready to face off against their hated rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, twice in the last four games of the regular season.
The way the playoff matchups are set up, the Pens and Flyers will most likely square off for another seven games between the two teams.
How sweet would it be for Jaromir Jagr to lead his new team to victory against the team he became famous with that refused to overpay to sign him this past summer?
Which leads one to think, with Sidney Crosby out most of the year, could the Penguins have won the division had they signed Jagr?
Jagr has 18 goals and 52 points with the Flyers, and he's missed 10 regular-season games. He has shown he still has it this year. Also, he loves playing against Pittsburgh. He's scored three goals against his former team in four games, and who knows what he has in store for the last two games and playoffs?
The Flyers are a solid offensive team with 251 goals on the season and it's been a conducive environment for No. 68. Pittsburgh might've been an even better situation for Jagr, considering all the stars they have on that team.
He would've most likely been playing with James Neal and Evgeni Malkin. There's no doubt he would've been able to replicate his scoring numbers with the Pens.
Although Steve Sullivan has been an awesome alternative for Pittsburgh, scoring 15 goals and 31 assists, there's no doubt that Jagr is the better player.
He would've had more scoring opportunities skating with Geno and Jordan Staal. And now with Crosby back, this team would be even more explosive.
With Jagr due for free agency once again this summer, the Pens would be wise to give him another shot—there is no reason why they shouldn't consider bringing him back.
There were questions heading into this season whether Jagr would be able to play a full season at the NHL level. He hadn't been in the league for several years and, it goes without saying, the Russian KHL is not on the same level as the NHL.
Would you consider signing Jagr this summer?
Jagr, however, has shown that he's barely missed a step. Sure, he's not leading the league in scoring, but he's 40 years old and he's providing positive offensive contributions for a playoff team. Only guys like Nicklas Lidstrom and Teemu Selanne can say the same.
Also, speaking of Lidstrom and Selanne, they're playing at a high level well past their 40s. Why can't Jaromir?
He's showing that he's good for another two or three years and that it doesn't matter how old you are. If you play with Sid and Geno, you're going to put up fantastic numbers.
Plus, he'll still be able to repair his legacy with Pittsburgh fans, as he tarnished it to a great extent this by signing with the rival Flyers.
Jagr has shown that signing him won't be just a PR move for teams.
The dude can play, and he's going to be around for a little while more.

Jon Jones vs. Vitor Belfort: What Can Jon Jones Do to Get Some Fans?
For the first time in his UFC career, Jon Jones walked out to a chorus of boos prior to his UFC 152 title defense against Vitor Belfort.
This wasn’t exactly shocking to the MMA world, especially after the debacle that was UFC 151, but for a fighter to go from loved to hated as quickly as Jones has over the last six months has been a rather extraordinary situation.
The fall from grace began for Jones shortly after his UFC 145 title defense against Rashad Evans.
Going into that bout, Jones was still a heavy fan favorite over nearly everyone in the UFC’s light heavyweight division, but you could feel the crowd start to turn against Jones for the first time leading up to that fight.
Most chalked it up to fans getting sick of the dominance that Jones had displayed during his recent destruction of the division, but it turned out to be more than that once the light heavyweight champion of the world was charged with a DUI just weeks after his successful defense against Evans.
The immediate public backlash following the DUI was harsh and ended up lasting far longer than a lot of people anticipated, but it seemed like the criticism of Jones had finally died down leading up to his scheduled title fight against Dan Henderson at UFC 151.
However, an injury to Henderson forced the UFC to go into panic mode just a week prior to the event, and when Jones deemed former middleweight challenger Chael Sonnen an unsuitable replacement for Henderson on just a week's notice, the card was cancelled and the hatred for Jones amongst fans grew considerably.
Now that Jones survived the initial blowback last night, it’s time for him to start attempting to rebuild his image.
After all, Jones is one of the most well-known fighters in the sport, and with the ink still drying on his contract with Nike, it seems doubtful that anyone connected with Jones wants him to remain the villain for long.
The UFC could set Jones up against Dan Henderson or Lyoto Machida and let him slowly gain back his fanbase by taking out a few more top-tier fighters, but if Jones is truly looking to get back into the fans' good graces, there’s only one fight that could set him back on the right path to be loved again.
This is where Chael Sonnen comes in.
No matter how many fans tried to make Chael Sonnen the conquering hero of the UFC 151 situation, the fact remains that Sonnen has used his mouth to become one of the most despised fighters in the history of our young sport and it will take someone of Sonnen’s skill set to help Jones rebuild his image.
All it will take is for Sonnen to take to the media and start going after a few MMA legends to get the ball rolling, and when he takes another cheap shot at Jones, the champion can respond with a challenge.
This makes Jones the good guy all of a sudden, the champion of the future stepping up and defending the fighters who allowed him to get to where he is today, and he’ll end up back in the hearts of fans just as quickly as he left.
This may sound a but too much like a pro wrestling-style “work,” and I can understand why a lot of hardcore fans would be able to see through the smokescreen and call the situation what it is, but in the end, the only fans that Jones needs to convince to side with him again are the casual ones.
Without Sonnen it will take a long time for Jones to win over the fans again, and while there’s little doubt that eventually the public will end up back in his corner, the sooner it happens the better it will be for Jones and the UFC.
Whether anyone likes it or not, Jon Jones is well on his way to becoming a superstar and all it will take to get the fans back on his side is a few verbal barbs from a “Gangster” from West Linn, Oregon.

Notre Dame Football Recruiting: Top Instant Impact Recruits for Fighting Irish
USA TODAY Sports
After an undefeated regular season, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish should remain near the top with a number of instant impact recruits projected to join Brian Kelly’s team.
Just four years ago, the Fighting Irish snagged 5-star linebacker Manti Te'o out of Hawaii. Although he came up short in leading his team to a national title, Te'o was a bona fide star as soon as he stepped foot on campus.
Fast forward to 2013 and it appears the Fighting Irish will have secured their first 5-star linebacker since they brought Te'o to South Bend. Let's take a look at the top instant impact recruits for the Fighting Irish.
Jaylon Smith, LB, Bishop Luers HS
Jaylon Smith, the No. 2 overall player in the class of 2013, is regarded as a can't-miss prospect. Blessed with an incredible 6'3", 218-pound frame and 4.44 speed, the consensus top outside linebacker is a physical freak. Anyone who watched the U.S. Army All-American Bowl realized just how special this kid can be.
Lining up at both outside linebacker and with his hand in the dirt, the best player in the state of Indiana displayed impressive pass-rushing skills and even blocked a field goal. With his frame and athleticism, Smith could fit at any linebacker position. While he should ultimately end up as a premier 3-4 outside 'backer, Smith should make an instant impact on passing downs.
His pure speed and freakish first step should make him a pass-rushing nightmare, while his fluidity and pass-coverage skills will make him a valuable third-down defender.
As he continues to grow into his frame, Smith will evolve into an All-American player, but he'll certainly make noise as a third-down defender as a freshman.
Max Redfield, Safety, Mission Viejo HS
The strength of Notre Dame's recruiting class goes far beyond its top player. With safety Zeke Motta graduating, the Fighting Irish are in need of a playmaker on the back end. Ask and you shall receive.
Fellow 5-star recruit Max Redfield should step in immediately at Motta's free safety spot and become a first-round pick.
Pound for pound, Redfield might just be the best athlete in the country. Checking in at 6'' 3'', 195 pounds, the California native could dominate at receiver or defensive back, but looks like a lock at safety. A consensus top-five safety, Redfield draws high marks for his hands, instincts and coverage skills. Combined with his fantastic frame and 4.50 wheels, Redfield should be an upgrade over Motta.
Like Smith, he could bulk up a bit, but he should find his way onto the field early in his career.
His incredible skill set should give Fighting Irish fans plenty to cheer about in 2013.
Greg Bryant, RB, American Heritage HS
While Smith and Redfield should anchor the defense for years to come, running back Greg Bryant should be a staple on offense.
And with leading rushers Cierre Wood and Theo Riddick both departing for the NFL, the time is now for the 4-star tailback.
Checking in at 5'11", 196 pounds with 4.48 wheels, Bryant clearly has the size and speed to be an excellent college back. When watching the tape, it's evident that the star out of Delray Beach, Fla., runs with conviction. He isn't the shiftiest back, but plays with power behind his pads and breaks tackles consistently.
Notre Dame hasn't been able to reel in a running back with his talent in quite some time, so the Fighting Irish shouldn't be coy in showing off their new toy in 2013.

NBA Midseason Awards: All-League First Team
Steve Nash is averaging 17.4 points per game and 12 dimes. Nash has won back-to-back MVP awards and should have won three.
Nash flies down the court with tremendous vision and blows past slower defenders to dish it to anybody who is open. It doesn't matter if you’re in the highest seat in the house, he could hit you in the nose with a no-looker.
And with a good supporting cast like Amare Stoudemire, Raja Bell, Shawn Marion, and Grant Hill, Nash is even more dangerous.
Nash isn't afraid to get flashy to deliver pin-point pass to the hoop for an alley-oop to any one of his teammates.
Shooting Guard
Kobe Bryant has been known for his clutch performances and his stingy defense.
He's dropping 27.4 points per game and 5.1 assists.
For a while, it was thought he was carrying the team, but with Andrew "Baby Shaq" Bynum growing up right before our eyes, Kobe has become even more dangerous.
Bryant will pull up a jumper from anywhere with complete confidence that he is going to knock it down. He will also take a defender one-on-one and break his ankles.
A veteran, Bryant is still one of the best, if not the best player in the league.
Small Forward
LeBron James, the only player on the Cavs worth mentioning, is averaging 30.5 points and 7.1 assists.
He may not be the best shooter but dang-it if he wants to win, he will.
After coming off a big performance in San Antonio, James is looking to do the same back home tonight against the Wizards.
He amazed us last summer in the playoffs and now I look forward to seeing how he plans on bettering this year’s attempt at a NBA title.
Power Forward:
Dwight Howard is a beast with 24 points and 9.4 rebounds in the past few games ; he is looking to send the Orlando Magic back into the playoffs for the second straight year.
Since being drafted straight out of high school, Howard has been an awesome player for the Magic as they look to build a franchise around.
But he is not alone on the team, Jameer Nelson is the second go to guy on the team and looks to be more of a factor in the offense this year.
Center
Amare Stoudemire is joining his teammate Steve Nash on this list simply because he is the future of the Power Forward/Center position; and with 22.4 points a game and 9.3 rebounds this season it’s hard to argue with that.
This kid has a bright future and he clearly is going to become one of the most dominant players of all-time if he stays healthy.
Put up a shot near him and he is throwing it into the 7th row of the stands … then laughing at you for your stupidity.
His versatility is what makes him so great.
Coach
What good is a team without a good head coaching staff.
At this point in the year, I believe the best coaching staff has been the Los Angeles Lakers.
Phil Jackson and Co. have gone from being just a annoying fly in the west to becoming the flyswatter. This year the Lakers have improved from seventh in the west last season to third this season.
Coach Jackson is looking forward to returning to the playoffs for the third consecutive year and hopes to win another NBA title.
Does he have enough fingers for all of his rings?

Presentation on Exploring 'Distributed' in DDoS
Exploring Distributed in DDoS - Social Engineering aspects of an 'Anonymous' style DDoS attack
Recorded 24 April 2013.
Abstract:
With the proliferation of social media and mobile devices to masses, protecting against distributed denial of service attacks has become an arduous technical challenge. Even though we expect much more sophistication, research reports show that majority of anonymous style hacktivist attacks originate from distributed denial of service. During analysis of the largest-known hacker forums with roughly 250,000 members, impervia's hacker intelligence report states that social networks today pose a major interest for hackers. In this talk we discuss the technical challenges and potential remediation of such denial of service attacks. The presentation will elaborate on key tenets of defense in depth, web application security and do's and outline potential threats for financial application domain.
The Cultural Knowledge Consortium (CKC) is a joint and inter-agency effort established to provide a Socio-cultural Knowledge Infrastructure (SKI) to help provide access and connect multi-disciplinary, worldwide, social science expertise and support collaborative engagement efforts in support of Combatant Command (COCOM) socio-cultural analysis requirements.

Hacking Web Apps - Book Review
Hacking Web Apps - Detecting and Preventing Web Application Security Problems - by Mike Shema is a contemporary guide on web application security. Mike's labor of love, as he likes to call this book, contains very relevant and distilled information on modern day web application attacks. The book is different from your garden variety web-application-top-n-style verbose texts with template vulnerabilities and hello-world solutions; Hacking web apps is a book with strong personality which shows in the eight chapters covering diverse topics from HTML5 security, XSS, CSRF, platform weaknesses to browser and privacy attacks.
Starting with HTML5, author discussed security issues surrounding "new" DOM, CORS, web sockets, web storage, web workers in a concise and concrete manner. This first chapter, however brief, makes this book quite unique since very few books in my knowledge have dealt with security issues pertaining to HTML5. The book provides a nice knowledge upgrade to exploits and vulnerabilities when it comes to web 2.0 technologies. Packed with tips, epic failures and notes providing security anecdotes from the real-world, this text keeps you involved and entertained throughout. Going beyond usual CWE-SANS/OWASP top x vulnerabilities, author elaborates on design issues and draw parallels on how to apply these issues to other similar problems. The text tends to be language agnostic and code samples are in multiple languages (python, php etc) but I do miss the examples with specifics of libraries such as AntiForgeryToken in ASP.NET MVC.
Since I have not read any of Mike's previous books, I cannot comment on how much is shared between his writings but for any web and server side developer interested in security, I'd highly recommend reading this book.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ Something just didn't feel right about that Purple Heart medal up for grabs in an Illinois garage sale.
The conviction led the buyer on an information quest that ended in Gurley last week when the medal was presented to the family of the long-deceased soldier.
The recipient. private first class Veer M. Krause, was killed in action in the Korean Conflict - often known as the Forgotten War.
Thank goodness the medal purchaser had the fortitude to track down its history so Krause's valor would also not be forgotten.
Such medals are earned, not bought in garage sales for a buck.
This one had been paid for in blood. A priceless keepsake for family members of the deceased.
Krause was killed in the Battle of the Naktong Bulge in South Korea on Sept. 8, 1950. The medal was awarded on Jan. 2, 1951. He was living in Norfolk County, Va. with his grandmother when he joined the military in 1949. How it wound up an east-central Illinois yard sale remains a mystery.
Judy Krause-Mobley of Gurley had been looking for information about her late father and her deceased uncle, Veer M. Krause. She had submitted an e-mail to the Korean War Veteran's Association newsletter last year after learning of their military service.
Meanwhile, a bargain hunter stumbled across some medals encased in a faded black box in a garage sale in Jacksonville, Ill.
Veer Krause's name was inscribed on the back of the Purple Heart. The other medal and a presidential proclamation also belonged to him,
The medal purchaser, insisting on anonymity, contacted a newspaper reporter for the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Jacksonville, Ill.
The reporter gleaned details about Krause's military service through a congressman. The buyer said he thought it "sad" that the seller had told him the box of military honors was from a family friend and didn't mean anything to her.
A further investigation by the Journal-Courier led to the newsletter inquiry by Gurley's Krause-Mobley. The newspaper sent the Purple Heart and other keepsakes in a package to The Huntsville Times, which set up an official handover last Friday from local officials with the Military Order of the Purple Heart.
So now, a Madison County family can relish in the valor of a loved one who served his country honorably.
Other items given the family include Veer's Good Conduct Medal, a box of family photographs and a proclamation signed by President Harry Truman that reads: "Freedom lives and through it he lives, in a way that humbles the undertakings of most men."
By most accounts, Veer, a member of the 38th Infantry, had been in Korea for less than three weeks when he died.
A salute to the garage sale purchaser who didn't want this Purple Heart recipient's service to go unnoticed.

Addressing the “summer break’s here” attitude!
May 8th, 2011 by Cathy Jo Nelson
I sent this in an email to staff, and shared via facebook too. This is a snippet from my reader (Jenny Lucca’s Lucacept–Intercepting the Web) about a recent Ted Talk (Formal Title — Ted: Ideas Worth Sharing). Ted is pretty much a favorite video blog, and I’m always playing catch up with it. The snippet below is where Jenny Lucca, who is from Melbourne, Australia, and (and a member of my PLN) blogged about it. Of course as soon as I read it there I had to go view.
Jenny wrote:
… personalized search, where organizations.
To add to this commentary, I am sharing with my staff that I certainly will be adding this to my instruction on searching, and also add it as a good reason to use the DISCUS (and now EBSCO,) the vehicles to databases we use as the primary source for information for research, and not the favored search engine. I am a Google FREAK no less than most students, but I understand that it is not the best source for authoritative research that is accurate, unbiased, often refereed, current, and reliable. Many of our kids do not yet understand this.
I wrote to certain ones on my staff this added comment as well:
Since I feel you challenge your students to think critically, this would be a wonderful ten minute video that could spur debate or more in your classes. The video is located at: (directly form the Ted Talks site)
as well as from Youtube
If Ted is blocked, we need to work to have it unblocked–it is that powerful (but that’s another soapbox for another day.)
Please share in your department where you think this is relevant.
At this time of the school year, when most standardized testing is done (the only thing left to my knowledge is AP Exams, and they are almost done) it is difficult to kindle interest in much schoolwork–among students and teachers. I think Ted Talks could drive our entire curriculum for these last fifteen days of school.

For businesses looking to implement their first supply chain integration systems, or those looking to improve that which they already have, the future of the methodology will remain of interest. The continued explosion of hosted systems (also known as Software as a Service – SaaS), has already begun to radically alter the supply chain integration landscape.
As discussed elsewhere throughout this short series of articles, supply chain integration is currently a job requiring extensive (expensive) expertise due to the complexities inherent in joining multiple computer systems. As with most technological advances, implementation of integrations should get inherently easier as on-site complexity is reduced. Suppliers will be faced with the choice of rolling out the exact same ERP system in each of their own businesses, or to outsource the EDI functions required to communicate between disparate systems to a third-party.
As cloud-based software and services continue to mature, the use of on-site systems becomes more expensive and effectively redundant. By outsourcing functions to the cloud such as invoicing and billing, businesses immediately benefit from a reduction in complexity and duplicated effort. An ideal Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) platform will take input from any ERP or accounting system, as Celtrino’s Smart Admin product does, and seamlessly convert and transfer the data to a receiving system. The onus for translation and EDI connectivity becomes the responsibility of the hosted service provider.
In such a scenario, the cloud service provider configures and maintains the EDI connectors for the systems of all of their service users, for the same subscription fee.

Story Provided by: Cleveland Engineering Society.
Engineers are in demand in NE Ohio, and more are needed. With more than 300 current openings for engineers and 86.7% of engineering leaders saying they plan to hire more engineers this year, the Cleveland Engineering Society (CES) and its member companies are working hard to find both the current and next generation of engineering and technical professionals needed in the local workforce.
CES announced today that it has completed its first annual "Pulse of the Profession" analysis of the NE Ohio engineering and related professions. The effort uncovered more than 300 engineering positions open today, and identified 200 positions that companies plan to hire for in the remainder of 2013. The needs span across all engineering disciplines, with the Civil and Mechanical disciplines leading the way at 26.7% and 20% of the identified future needs respectively. Although the NE Ohio region has its own subset of needs, these results align, generally, with a recent national survey published by Engineering News Record (ENR) which identified Mechanical and Electrical as the disciplines expecting the largest shortages by 2014.
According to the CES survey, 46.7% of engineering leaders in NE Ohio believe there is a shortage of engineers in the region with 38.5% of those believing that not enough young people considering engineering or technical based career paths is a primary reason for the shortage.
The survey also uncovered that the demand for engineers is not driven solely by retirements. Although the retirement of a generation of experienced engineers is a significant concern facing the profession as a whole, it appears that organizations in NE Ohio don't see this issue as an immediate near term concern or driver for their openings. 60% of engineering leaders indicated that they do not anticipate a significant portion of their engineering workforce to retire in the next five years.
So why the big demand for engineers? What do engineers do and what are they involved in anyways? The answer: everything. This week, February 17 – 23 2013, is national engineers week, an annual celebration that many corporations and organizations participate in to help promote the positive impacts engineers have on society and bring more recognition to the profession while also acting as an inspiration for outreach to encourage young people to consider careers in engineering.
"Engineers are a true catalyst to the economy and society, generally not a single product gets invented or produced, or a building or facility gets built, or a bridge or road is opened without some type of engineer, and often many types of engineers, being involved", said Brandon Davis, Director of Industrial Manufacturing at URS, Cleveland's largest engineering firm, and member of the board of directors at CES. "It is a profession that helps turn dreams into reality, and engineers are a key part of nearly everything we do in our daily lives", he continued.
He is right; engineers are involved in manufacturing, building, government, research & development, medicine, education, and even on Wall Street. They are everywhere, that car or bus we rode in today, the house or building we live in, that iphone or computer that has revolutionized our lives, the water we drink, the lights we use, that new medical device that saves lives, even the sports we watch, engineers are quietly at the center of it all and have been since the pyramids and before. No wonder there is such a demand for them.
"Engineering remains a good profession in NE Ohio, with something like less than 3% unemployment amongst engineers, it is clear that people who have an engineering background are in demand" said Ron Czaplicki, Principle at Barber & Hoffman, a local engineering firm, and current President of the CES board of directors. "Cleveland has a history of invention and innovation, and I think we are going to continue that tradition, but only with the help of great engineers", he continued.
The CES "Pulse of the Profession" analysis looked at current openings within a 60 mile radius of Cleveland's public square, and surveyed senior managers who oversee an estimated 3,000 engineering and related professionals in the region. The respondents were primarily members of CES, which includes manufacturers, contractors, technical consultants, and members of Build Up Greater Cleveland (BUGC), which represents public agencies in the region.
About Cleveland Engineering Society The Cleveland Engineering Society (CES) is a non-profit professional (NSPE), it is among the oldest of America's professional outreach efforts.

Who do Tanzanians have to bribe before they get a service? Which institutions demand the most bribes? What actions to citizens take if asked for a bribe? And do citizens think corruption is increasing or declining?
Last week the Kenyan chapter of Transparency International published the East African Bribery Index, to provide answers to these questions and promote debate on corruption within the region. They've certainly succeeded in the second part of this, getting a fair bit of coverage in the press and drawing responses from the heads of several of the institutions found to be most corrupt, including the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Blandina Nyoni.

Google Mars
Google launched a new service for their maps today: Google Mars
It offers infared views of a slect portion of the Red planet’s surfface. Kinda cool, allows you to zoom in quite a bit, and, unlike the moon, Mars is not made of cheese. However, if you zoom out all the way, you’ll notice that you’re really only looking at a tiny strip of Mars, probably one photograph just strung togther in a loop. Oh well, its cool either way.

Q3 15:00: Matt Prater is about to kick off, and Jordan Shipley is deep to receive for the Bengals. Shipley returns it to the 20-yard line.
Q3 14:45: Bernard Scott is chased out of bounds by Baraka Atkins, but there are two flags on the play. First, personal foul on the offense for a late hit. Second was a holding penalty on the offense, which was accepted by the Broncos for a 10-yard penalty. On first-and-20, J.T. O’Sullivan finds Shipley for a 5-yard gain before the receiver is brought down by Joe Mays. On second down, O’Sullivan sets up a screen pass to Scott, and the running back gets all the way to the Denver 39-yard line. Darcel McBath and Mays are down after the play.
Q3 13:38: Both players walk off the field under their own power, flanked by trainers. On the ensuing first down, the Bengals pick up another first down on an O’Sullivan-to-Jerome Simpson connection for a 21-yard gain. Scott picks up 2 yards on first down, followed by an incomplete pass intended for Andre Caldwell. On third-and-8 at the Denver 16-yard line, O’Sullivan finds Shipley, but Johnny Williams is there for the tackle short of the first-down marker. After the 6-yard gain, Dave Rayner kicks a 27-yard field goal to give Cincinnati the league.
CINCINNATI 20, DENVER 17
Q3 11:26: Matthew Willis returns the kickoff to the 22-yard line, and Brady Quinn jogs back to the huddle at quarterback. Of the starters, only Zane Beadles and J.D. Walton remain in the game. The rest of the first-teamers appear to be done for the day.
*INJURY UPDATE* McBath has an arm injury and is questionable to return to the game. Mays has a groin injury and is probable to return.
Q3 9:45: After a Bruce Hall run for no gain, Quinn connects with Willis for a 30-yard pickup down the middle of the field to the Cincinnati 48-yard line. After a Hall run for a loss of 3, Quinn looks deep once again, this time to Patrick Carter, but the receiver can’t quite haul it in and it falls off his fingertips. On third down, Quinn is sacked to bring out Colquitt for a punt. The Broncos are called for delay of game, giving Colquitt a little more room to work with. He gets the punt off on fourth-and-23, where Shipley fields it inside the 20. The rookie gets out to about the 37-yard line. It was a 44-yard punt and a 21-yard return.
Q3 8:41: The defense is on the field, and Tim Tebow is warming up on the sideline. On first down, James Johnson picks up a yard. On second down, O’Sullivan is sacked by Jammie Kirlew to bring up third-and-13. On the next play, O’Sullivan finds Johnson again, but Alphonso Smith takes down the back after a gain of 6. Kevin Huber is back to punt, with Perrish Cox deep to receive. The rookie muffs the punt and there’s a scrum to see who recovered it — it’s Cincinnati’s ball.
Q3 6:40: The Bengals will take over at the Denver 12-yard line, but Cox is down after the play.
Q3 6:39: After Cox walked off the field flanked by two trainers, O’Sullivan and the Bengals get their drive going again. With no one open downfield, the quarterback takes off before being taken down by Baraka Atkins. It was a gain of 3 yards. On second down, James Johnson is swallowed up after a gain of 2, bringing up third-and-5. On the ensuing play, O’Sullivan is sacked by a diving Atkins for a loss of 6. Dave Rayner is in for a field goal attempt, which is nearly blocked by Tony Carter. The kicker gets it off, however, and drives home the 31-yarder to extend the Cincinnati lead to six.
CINCINNATI 23, DENVER 17
**INJURY UPDATE** Cox’s injury is just cramping, and is probable to return.
Q3 4:39: After a 28-yard kickoff return by Cassius Vaughn, boos rain down from the crowd as Tim Tebow marches onto the field for his first play as a Bronco. He fakes a handoff before rolling to his right and finding Marquez Branson for a pickup of 5 yards. On second down, he hands off to Bruce Hall for no gain, bringing a large reaction from Bengals defender Michael Johnson. On third down, Tebow lines up in the shotgun. He drops back and fires deep to Willis, who has beaten his man. The receiver has the pass in his hands and drops it, bringing up fourth down.
Q3 2:59: Colquitt booms a 52-yard punt, which is downed at the 8-yard line, where the Cincinnati offense takes over. On first down, O’Sullivan fakes a handoff before finding Jerome Simpson for an 18-yard gain. The next play brings a run by Johnson for a gain of 4. Johnson takes another handoff on the next play, picking up 15 yards.
Q3 1:15: After an incompletion, it’s second-and-10, and O’Sullivan hands off to Johnson yet again. The back picks up a first down before being tackled by David Bruton. It’s now first-and-10 for Cincinnati at the Denver 43-yard line. After an incompletion on the following play, O’Sullivan appears to fumble the ball on a sack — but the ruling on the field is that it was an incomplete pass, bringing up third-and-10. The third-down play has O’Sullivan in the shotgun. The quarterback drops back and fires toward Daniel Coats, and the tight end hauls it in for a 16-yard gain, bringing the third quarter to a close.
Q4 15:00: A new Bengals quarterback has entered the game — Jordan Palmer, Carson’s younger brother. He hands off to Johnson for no gain, and on second down lofts a pass deep toward Simpson that flies out of bounds incomplete — but Tony Carter is called for pass interference, giving Cincinnati a first down at the 4-yard line.
Q4 13:32: A 3-yard run by Johnson to the 1-yard line is followed by a run for no gain — the back was tackled by Ben Garland — bringing up third-and-1 at the 1. On the next play, Johnson is drilled in the air short of the goal line, but one ref runs in late with a touchdown call. Rayner’s extra point is good, and the Bengals now lead 30-17.
CINCINNATI 30, DENVER 17
Q4 12:47: Cassius Vaughn is back to receive the kickoff for the Broncos. The rookie steps out of bounds at the 26-yard line after fielding it 2-yards deep in his end zone. Tebow is back in at quarterback. On first down, he hands off to Hall, who is brought down for a loss of a yard. Second down brings a pass from Tebow under pressure — a quick dump off to Britt Davis for a gain of 7. The attendance has been announced as 51,278 fans, by the way. On third down, Tebow is in the shotgun. The rookie drops back and fires toward Willis, who can’t haul it in. Colquitt is back in to punt, and he kicks it to about the 18-yard line. The Bengals have another productive punt return, as Quan Cosby gets out to the Denver 39-yard line after the 50-yard punt — it was a 43-yard return.
Q4 10:32: After a 5-yard completion, Jordan Palmer drops back and hands off to Johnson. The running back picks up 2 yards, bringing up third-and-3. On third down, Palmer drops back into the shotgun. He takes the snap and takes off when no one is open downfield, running for the first down himself.
Q4 8:57: Perrish Cox is in on the tackle on first down — a run for no gain. On second down, Palmer’s pass is tipped and falls incomplete. Third-and-10 brings a bootleg from Palmer after no one is open downfield. He sprints toward the sideline and leaps to dive up and over Alphonso Smith for a first down before giving the cornerback a tap on the helmet.
Q4 7:05: Chris Baker was shaken up on a run by Cedric Peerman for no gain, but he is walking off the field under his own power. Second down brings another run by Peerman for a gain of 6 to the Denver 11-yard line, setting up third-and-4. The following play is another run, but Jeff Stehle and Ben Garland are there for the stop short of the first down marker. On fourth down, Rayner is in for another field goal attempt. The 26-yarder is good, extending the Cincinnati lead.
CINCINNATI 33, DENVER 17
Q4 5:35: Vaughn is back deep to field the kickoff. He gets it out to the 16-yard line, where Tebow and the offense take over. On first down, Tebow is nearly sacked but he gets the pass off — it falls incomplete. On second down, Tebow drops back and gets a pass off to Hall for a gain of 6. That makes it third-and-4 at the 22-yard line. On the next play, Tebow lines up in the shotgun. The rookie fires to Alric Arnett’s back shoulder, and the fellow first-year player adjusts to make the catch for a 21-yard gain.
Q4 4:28: Hall picks up a yard on first down, and Tebow drops back on second down before rolling to his right and being taken down for a loss of two. On third-and-11, Tebow lines up in the shotgun and doesn’t see a blitzer, who hits him and forces a fumble. The Bengals pick it up and run it in for a touchdown — but Head Coach Josh McDaniels and the Broncos are challenging the call on the field of a fumble.
Q4 3:37: The refs rule that his arms was going forward, reversing the call and deeming it an incomplete pass. On fourth down, the offense remains on the field, but J.D. Walton seemed to think Tebow was under center when he was in the shotgun. The snap never gets to Tebow, who is forced to dive forward to pick it up and run for a handful of yards before being tackled for a turnover on downs.
Q4 2:00: The clock runs down to the two-minute warning after three Bengals running plays that has moved Cincinnati to the Denver 24-yard line — second-and-1.
Q4 1:59: The Bengals are called for a false start, making it second-and-6. Jammie Kirlew is there for the stop on the next play, bringing up third-and-3 after a run by Johnson. As the clock continues to wind down, Johnnie Williams sprints into the backfield to put an end to a fullback carry for a loss of 2 on third down, making it fourth-and-5. The Broncos call a timeout. The Bengals elect to go for it on fourth down, firing a pass toward tight end Chase Coffman inside the 10-yard line, but it falls incomplete, and Denver will take over on downs.
Q4 1:09: Tebow is back in under center at his own 27-yard line. On first down, he lofts a screen pass to Hall, who is taken down hard at the 44-yard line. On the following play, he dumps off a pass to Hall who picks up 9 yards before the Broncos call their second timeout of the half.
Q4 0:40: Tebow finds Branson for a first down as the clock continues to run. On the next play, he rolls to his right and fires deep to Britt Davis, who hauls in the pass and runs out of bounds at the Cincinnati 7-yard line. It’s a 33-yard connection. On the next play — with 12 seconds remaining — Tebow is in the shotgun. He buys time, rolls to his right and fires to Branson in the end zone — but refs rule that the tight end trapped the ball and the pass was incomplete. The booth decides to review the play, however.
Q4 0:03: The ruling on the field is confirmed, and the Broncos are left with one last play — second-and-goal — from the 7-yard line. Tebow is in the shotgun with Ball to his left. The rookie drops back before taking off and powering his way past two defenders into the end zone — one of which stays down after the play. Cincinnati is charged a timeout for the injury. Matt Prater kicks the extra point as time expires to give the Broncos 24 points in the game — a 33-24 loss to Cincinnati in Denver’s first preseason game of 2010. It was Cincinnati’s second preseason game. The Broncos will be back in action this Saturday at INVESCO Field at Mile High against the Detroit Lions. Look for more coverage from tonight’s game on DenverBroncos.com in the coming hours.

In order for anyone to play Saturday, I would think that they would have to be participating in this week practices, tomorrow through Thursday, if not I don’t see why McD would play them. So my guess is at least we’ll know by Thursday if those guys will play or not.
For all the Westbrook fans out here, he just signed with the 49ers.
And the Saints signed the one who just turned us down last week, Ladell Betts.
We don’t those guys. We have all pro running back lance ball. :/
*need
Bruce Hall is my favorite, last night, 5 runs, minus 3 yards, long 1 yard, but the guy caught a bunch, LOL.
I think the passes to Bruce Hall are the only ones Quinn could complete, haha.
bay – that was my response to the guys re: Hillis but you know how they can be… don’t want to hear any b.s. excuses. (In their minds anyway).
At any rate, we now know it’s just a matter of time for Tebow to climb the depth chart to #2. He’s only going to get better.
Won’t go there about Quinn, but maybe he’ll have a better outing next game. Orton sure looked great though…no doubt! It was clear on the 2nd TD that he audibled at the line of scrimmage on a called running play! Way to go KO!
So I am guessing we practice tomorrow?? I really hope Deck and Thomas are out there or at least them play in our next game vs Detroit!!
I love me some Broncos Country!!
Here is your answer:
Today,.
I hear you rbf1, enjoy your first game of the season at Invesco, with at least 9 to follow, football life must be rough for you, LOL.
No need to put any stock in the pre-season games. Only thing to pay attention to is how our first team plays against the opponnets first team, and even that doesn’t carry much weight. The coaches aren’t going to show anyone to much out of the play book. Really it is just a chance for the staff to weed out the weeklings, grt the rookies into some game type atmospheres and experience, and get out all the jitters. Now go kick some first team Detriot but.
Javis Best should be a good test for our first team D line and LB’s
Go Broncos
keep in mind folks that McD did state in a press conference before the cincy game that the team was going to work on the things they needed to work on and not worry about the score. evaluating talent and getting to practice against another team is the main focus of preseason. so i dont see anything to worry about! ask me again after 4 weeks of regular season play!
Go Broncos
“THE BATTLE IS WON IN THE TRENCHES”
What’s up my Broncos family? This is a non football question. Does anyone know where I can find the Denver Broncos silicone wristband bracelet? They are like the Lance Armstrong “Live Strong” bracelet excpet says Denver Broncos and are Orange, Blue, and Orange/Blue.
I’ve been trying to find these things for the longest of time. I saw a Dolphin fan with some on a few days ago and the chump wouldn’t tell me where he got his from.
posting to read
I got a question…. How come in all the articles I read about Tim Tebow they are refering to the over turned call of him fumbling and losing the ball as a fumble still? Is it they are trying to highlight something bad that he had done? I relize the guys throwing motion looks exactly the same as it did in college, but if it works…… Don’t fix it. Right? His release could be a little sharper and quicker…. But it hasn’t hurt him yet. I don’t think he is ready to start and yes I am a believer in Titanium Tim, but realisticly we are talking at least next season b4 he starts. Orton looks great and I will stand behind him this year! I believe his numbers can rival Romo…. I hate that guy!!! Well hate is a strong word and I am sure it has more to do with the fact that he is a Cowboy than anything.
Romo is a choke artist, hopefully Orton can be better than him, he has a more professional approach to the game and I’ll take that over Hollywood Romo.
As for Tebow’s throwing motion I go back to Elway who said the coaching staff is making too big a deal of it, that with the strength and speed that he throws at, that delivery of his is fine. I mention Elway because if I say it it might sound like crap to many, but when Elway talks people should listen, Tebow should throw however he is comfortable is my opinion, but McD so far hasn’t listened. Young man, a lot stubborn and hasn’t learned quite yet that his way is not the only way, he should take advice from Elway on this one.
Still can’t believe people are saying that Orton looked great….i saw again the same QB that cannot get the ball down the field, who is inaccurate, and relies on his receivers to make him look good. I saw a first team offense that underwhelmed against non gameplanned defense. I saw us get lucky to end up with 14 because the call on Hall was borderline at best. I saw Tebow, playing against guys that will be playing in the UFL. Also saw a defense, give up yardage like crazy and not even come close to pressuring Palmer. Maybe my tv is messed up…LOL, someone prove me wrong
Many experts such as Shanahan have said that the problem with changing someone’s delivery is that when in a tough position the QB will most likely reverse to his old motion, going by instint using his natural motion, so why in the heck would you mess his throwing motion to start with, just confusion is all it can bring to Tebow is the way I see it. Let the man worry about the field as he says himself, not his throwing motion.
thanks bay.. we’ll do our best to enjoy and support our Denver Broncos!!
And to the question why would articles keep bringing up the point of the Tebow fumble that wasn’t, most of the experts have said Tebow couldn’t make it in the NFL as a QB, they obviously are going to hold on to whatever they can get, just pushing back the inevitable fact that they will all be fools in the end.
I think from a football perspective, one of the things youteach is that you don’t put the ball on the ground. That is why they are calling it a “fumble” because that is what he did. The timing of the fumble is what got it overturned, but the fact that he did fumble is not to be diminished. It is just like when someone runs for a touchdown, but it is brought back, no the touchdown does not stand, but he did run for it. I don’t think it is an attack by the media.
Ok… Was just strang when it is ruled incomplete that it is called a fumble by everyone… On another note… Tebow had the best QB rating out of all the rookies…. Don’t know if Bradford started or was a back up in his first outing, but either way, it sounds as if Tebow had a fine first outing and showed his determination to win a football game with his last effort in the redzone!
granted just a preseason game, but could not help but notice a lack of receiver talent, but then again KO has no long ball so maybe it will not be an issue. I liked what I saw in Tebow, his first NFL (even though it was preseason) game, certainly looked better than Quinn, and I liked the way he just muscled the ball down field looking much like big ben, the lefty thing was weird to watch but I can see how that can develop into a real asset, specially with someone his size, it’s going to be fun to watch. With the Lions coming up this week I don’t expect much but I do hope to see the team solidify as we get closer to the regular season.
GO BRONCOS
Haha, a lack of receiver talent tends to happen when you trade away one of the best guys in the NFL and then lose your top two WR picks in the draft to injury. Did Royal ever play? I missed the first half. As far as Tebow’s throwing motion goes, I can see the “if it isn’t broke don’t fix it” argument, but it really does need to be a bit quicker. There were two plays that could have been made had Tebow managed to get the ball out just half a second faster.
Royal, 1 catch, 1 TD.

The important things to bridge the differences in the professional nursing practice in the United States are:
1. Develop critical thinking skills. Always ask how, what, when, where, who, and what-if questions. Seek to understand the need for what is not understood. It creates deeper and more meaningful learning when we ask questions and search for answers. It also expands knowledge and leads to future change with less frustration.
2. Be true to ourselves. Stay strong, positive, and use positive energy everyday. Do not fall into the trap of negativity. Keep eyes open, mind clear, and refuse to go into a negative pit. There is no room for negativity.
3. Limit negativity.
4. Plan to bridge the differences in our nursing practices in many steps.
Attachment I: Examples of possible solutions and preparation to bridge the differences in changing and adapting our professional nursing practice in the United States.
Differences
Our Possible Solutions
Assess and re-assess our patients
Report abnormal finding
Learn emergency responses – RRT, Code Blue with education in ACLS and PALS
Giving P.O. medications and medication reconciliation
Protect patients’ privacy and protect colleagues’ privacies

Attachment III – Read-Back
Read-back is a way to verify of the complete order by the person who receiving the verbal order. The receiving person will repeat the verbal order back to the ordering clinician, who will verbally confirm that the repeated order is correct. The purpose of “Read-back” is to ensure patient safety.

The following is a Diversity Statement written and signed by numerous colleges and universities and taken from the University of Virginia's website for their Office of African American Affairs. It provides good insight into the value that diversity adds in higher education, which almost always applies to professions, like nursing, as well.
On the Importance of Diversity in Higher Education
America's colleges and universities differ in many ways. Some are public, others are independent; some are large urban universities, some are two-year community colleges, others small rural campuses. Some offer graduate and professional programs, others focus primarily on undergraduate education. Each of our more than 3,000 colleges and universities has its own specific and distinct mission. This collective diversity among institutions is one of the great strengths of America's higher education system, and has helped make it the best in the world. Preserving that diversity is essential if we hope to serve the needs of our democratic society.
Similarly, many colleges and universities share a common belief, born of experience, that diversity in their student bodies, faculties, and staff is important for them to fulfill their primary mission: providing a quality education. The public is entitled to know why these institutions believe so strongly that racial and ethnic diversity should be one factor among the many considered in admissions and hiring. The reasons include:.
American colleges and universities traditionally have enjoyed significant latitude in fulfilling their missions. Americans have understood that there is no single model of a good college, and that no single standard can predict with certainty the lifetime contribution of a teacher or a student. Yet the freedom to determine who shall teach and be taught has been restricted in a number of places, and come under attack in others. As a result, some schools have experienced precipitous declines in the enrolment of African-American and Hispanic students, reversing decades of progress in the effort to assure that all groups in American society have an equal opportunity for access to higher education.
Achieving diversity appropriate for their missions. The success of higher education and the strength of our democracy depend on it.

This is the first of a 2-part article and is a follow up to the CAN (Chinese American Nurses) Sisters I published on our blog on August 23, 2011. Click Here to Read the first article in this series.
The article is the collaborative work of a team of Chinese American Nurses (CAN) sisters. It speaks as “foreign” nurses who have worked in America for a number of years. Our group is very lucky to have CAN meetings twice a month. We have each other’s support. We share our setbacks and clarify our things that might confuse us. Together we provide opportunities to think things through; to have a better understanding of ourselves, to not let fear paralyze us; and to add strengths to face tomorrow with positive thoughts and energy. Go CAN!! Go!!!Last month, a CAN nurse started to talk about the major differences that we are experiencing in the nursing functions and practices between China and the United States. Everyone joined in the discussion. Assess and Reassess Our Patients
In USA:Nurses are expected to know as much as possible about our patients. Nurses have a major responsibility in the assessment and re-assessment of our patients. Most nurses are doing a great job in assessing patients. Nurses are at patients’ bedside 24x7. Physicians are not. We may notice a change first, and take action as the law allows. We can initiate many nursing protocols, especially in an emergency, and then we report the changes to physicians. Physicians come to assess, verify, confirm the changes, and take additional actions.
In China:The nurse-to-doctor ratio is nearly 1:1 in China. Doctors are just like nurses, at patients’ bedside 24x7. When new patients arrive, doctors perform the first assessments.Report Abnormal Findings:In USA:Nurses report abnormal findings from our own assessments or from the results we receive from other departments or facilities. Most of our current practice is to report the results to nurses first. Nurses are expected and required to report abnormal findings to physicians. We can take actions that are legally allowed. Many nursing protocols are there for us to utilize, especially in an emergency, and then we turn around and report the results to physicians. Physicians come to assess, verify, confirm the changes, and take additional actions. In China:Doctors on the units get reports first. Nurses may not be aware of the results and reports. Therefore, nurses may not be aware of changes or actions needed.Emergency Responsibilities:In USA:Nurses or anyone who witnesses the need can call a code. A nurse is usually the initial emergency responder, until an organized team comes. Teams, including physicians, take over the emergency situation. Organized teams, such as the Rapid Response Team, Code Blue Team, and Trauma Team, have additional training in things like Advanced Critical Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support. In China:Doctors are at the patient’s bedside or nearby to respond and initiate emergency actions.Administering Medications:In USA:Nurses are responsible to ensure medications which are taken by mouth (P.O. medications) are swallowed every time, with no exceptions. In the Medication Reconciliation process in some facilities, nurses verify medications on an on-going basis. Verbal and telephone orders are seen often in some facilities.In China:In past practice, P.O. medications might be left at the patient’s bedside or with their families, trusting that the patients would take their medications. This is not the right thing to do. It is very dangerous. What if a patient purposely hides his/her medications, and then overdoses on them? China’s nursing practice is changing; now nurses are watching patients take their medication more often. Doctors are there to verify medications in the Medication Reconciliation process. No verbal orders.HIPAA Regulations:In USA:A patient’s health information is very private, personal property. It totally belongs to the patient. If we don’t have a patient’s written consent, or regulatory permissions, then we cannot give personal information to anyone except the patient. Self-imposed “kindness” such as initiating family or community support for a patient without the patient’s permission is no long allowed. For example, let’s say we go to work at the hospital and see our neighbor who is very sick. Our sick neighbor needs help, especially with child care. We cannot tell another neighbor who we think would be happy to help with the sick neighbor’s child. We have to plan ahead, talk about our intent, and ask the sick neighbor’s permission before we talk to the helpful neighbor. We would be violating the sick neighbor’s confidentiality if we talk to another neighbor without the sick neighbor’s permission. In China:Helpfulness and kindness are always welcome as long as it is a sincere act. Sterile TechniquePerforming and maintaining a sterile technique is a big deal in infection control to the nursing practice of both countries. Maintaining sterile technique saves lives, time and money.In USA:In some cases, CAN nurses had the perception that a few of their nurse co-workers’ practices were a bit sloppy. When you notice the lack of sterile technique, you must speak up. Express concern about contamination. This is a time to educate our co-workers in a kind way. Often the nurses who are doing the job may not be aware that contamination has occurred. Mentally, we know that it is difficult for us to point out any possible contaminations or any wrong doing. Culturally we were taught to pretend that we did not see; let others do whatever they want to do; we do what we are supposed to do to keep ourselves clean. “Mind our own business,” is what we learned. But in today’s world we need to prepare a simple and easy phrase or sentence that will help us to gently point out possible contamination. It will save lives. We have a lot to learn about how to be assertive and to be an advocate for our patients.In China:The fear of contamination and the strict self-monitoring of sterile techniques are emphasized more. CAN sisters feel that because of our past strict training, sterile technique is branded into our minds. PIV Insertions:In USA:Many facilities prefer to have IV Teams for Peripheral IV insertions to save nursing time, promote patient satisfaction, and decrease line infections. Therefore, nurses’ experiences in starting PIVs are very different. Some nurses do not have to start an IV at all and they have no skill in PIV insertion. For some nurses who start PIVs occasionally, their skill is hit-and-miss. Very few nurses are good at PIV insertion. In China: CAN nurses discovered in the support group meeting that most of nurses are good at PIV insertions. We found out that CAN nurses are the “go-to person” for performing PIV insertions. Personally, I have never paid much attention to this as a big difference. It was delightful to find out that this is one of our common strengths.Salaries & Bonuses:In USA:We make good salaries as nurses, even after about 40% is withheld in taxes, income taxes, and sale taxes. On the other hand, if we compare our salaries to physicians’ salaries, we find out a real gap. Physician pay is much higher. Of course, there are good reasons. Physician education and training are much longer and more in depth, and more physically and emotional demanding than nurses’ education. The demand for physicians is greater than the supply of physicians. We have many physician assistants and nurse practitioners who work under physicians and support some of our physician functions and responsibilities. In China: Nurses and physicians both have two types of incomes – regular salary and bonus. The nurses’ salaries are much closer to physicians’ salaries in China. Chinese doctors and nurses are equally compensated by the government. It is a perfect system for equal professionals. The differences in their earnings come from their bonuses, which are regulated and paid by the hospital. Currently, no nurse practitioners are working in a hospital or clinic in China.Nurse to Physician Ratio:In USA:The variety of job choices for nurses is huge, including acute hospital care, clinics, nursing homes, home health, insurance, occupational health, schools, law firms, etc. The nursing functions and responsibilities are varied, and it is very different in different health-care and non-health care settings. The physician to nurse ratio ranges from 1:4 to 1:8 or more, depending on the type of facility and the time of day or night. Some nurses function independently.In China:Most of nurses are working in hospitals and clinics, the nurse to physician ratio is nearly 1:1. It is a perfect ratio for an equal professionalism. No nurses are function independently. For us “foreign” nurses, especially those of us who have studied nursing or grown-up abroad, we often find that nursing functions and practices are very similar in some ways and quite different in other ways. This becomes apparent particularly on initial entry into the nursing profession in the USA. Adaptation will ease most barriers. The sooner we can identify the differences, analyze them, and find ways to adjust, the sooner we will adapt to the United States’ way of practice. As we open our hearts and minds to learn new things, we can expand our horizons. Every challenge forces us to learn and to bring out undiscovered talents within us, thereby making us stronger. There is no failure in trying to do the best we can do; the only failure is not trying to change and adapt to a different way of doing things. There are times we have to be brave enough, to have enough self confidence, and to excel on own strengths. We want to keep very strong, solid nursing skills, such as peripheral IV insertion skills. We want to keep the valuable nursing concepts, such as sterile techniques with us. Our skills will be lost if we do not practice constantly. In all, we are excited that we have opportunities to brand ourselves as the best we can be in United States.
Please watch for the second half to this article to be published later in December.

Many pastors and other concerned Baptists have contacted me to express their displeasure over this action. Several have suggested that, in the interest of unity and fairness, the Executive Director should mail out material that presents the other side of the issues that Dr. Vines addresses. As the pastor of a cooperating Florida Baptist Convention church, I certainly agree with that suggestion. But as one who has witnessed this kind of misrepresentation from denominational leaders over the last 25 years, I am under no delusions that this will happen.
While no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons, Dr. Sullivan reportedly was able to finance the mailing with the help of Eddie McClelland, President of Florida Baptist Financial Services. According to the article linked above, Mr. McClelland said that he was asked to raise money for this project. Dr. Sullivan, he said, asked him for a gift. He was unaware of the exact nature of the project. According to the article, he said, "I did not know it was political. Our agency doesn't get involved in politics. We serve all Florida Baptists."
I have been in contact with several Florida Baptist pastors (as well as many Southern Baptist pastors outside the state of Florida) who are very disappointed that those CDs were mailed from our state offices. A similar gaffe was made last year by the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention. Their Executive Director apologized once he realized how inappropriate that action was.
At the suggestion of my brother, Bill, I have made a special arrangement with the producers of the Amazing Grace DVD to secure and distribute copies of this tool to the very pastors who received the "Baptist Battles" CDs. Subtitled, "The History and Theology of Calvinism," this two-disk DVD presentation contains more than 4 hours of professionally produced interviews, quotes and explanations of the issues surrounding the doctrines of grace. Among those interviewed are Dr. Tom Nettles, the most prominent historical theologian among Southern Baptists today. Also, Pastors Walt Chantry, Walter Bowie and yours truly contribute to the DVD. For a sample clip, go here.
It will only cost $20,000 to get a copy of this powerful presentation into the hands of every Southern Baptist pastor in Florida. A special fund has been established by Founders Ministries for this very purpose. Let me encourage you to contribute to this project, as you are able and are led by the Lord, to help give Florida Baptist pastors the other side of the story--the side that was seriously caricatured by Dr. Vines' sermon.
You can send your tax exempt contributions to:
Founders Ministries
PO Box 150931
Cape Coral, Florida 33915
ATTN: Florida Baptist Truth Project

You may also contribute online by using the button below.
Riverbend Church of Ormond Beach, Florida, under the leadership of Dr. Roy Hargrave, has offered to match up to $5000 that is given by July 8. That means that your gift can be doubled if you give in the next two weeks.
In addition to supporting this effort by giving, I am asking that over the next several weeks you commit to fast and pray that the Lord will use this project to renew and rekindle a deep love for His Word and the Gospel of Jesus Christ not only in the churches of Florida but beyond them throughout the whole Southern Baptist Convention. Specifically, from June 24 through July 31, pray that those who receive this DVD would honestly watch it and open their hearts and minds to the truths from God's Word that it presents. Please encourage or lead your church to join in this prayer effort, as well.
Let me reiterate the purpose of this effort. The historic Southern Baptist understanding of salvation was blatantly misrepresented in the sermon sent out to Florida Baptist churches by our state Execuive Director. A growing number of pastors and churches in Florida believe the Bible teaches exactly that historic perspective. Thus, we and our churches were severely and widely misrepresented and the truth that we proclaim was caricatured to our fellow pastors and sister churches by our own state convention leadership. In an attempt to right this wrong, we are asking for all who love the doctrines of God's sovereign grace and are weary of seeing them distorted beyond recognition by Southern Baptist leaders to join with us in making the Amazing Grace DVD available to Florida Baptist pastors and churches.
We have no interest in division or in being contentious. We do have an interest in truth. We believe what we believe because we think the Bible teaches it. We understand that not everyone shares our convictions. But we desire of ourselves and ask of others, not to misrepresent the views of their brothers and sisters with whom they disagree on these vitally important issues.
For the cause of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, please pray that His truth will prevail and that we will all be humbled before it.

Excellent idea! I'm glad someone is thinking. Tom, it was good to see you in San Antonio.
Tom,
I have recently written a check for a couple thousand dollars to pay for a new motor in my car, so, unfortunately, I cannot contribute financially right now, but I will pray fervently for this. I have also passed it on to the elders of my church. Also, I wanted to let you know that I have not forgotten that project-response from earlier this year. Some protracted health issues have gotten in the way, and it took me a long while to complete my additional reading, which only confirmed the original thesis anyway, but I wanted to do some "text criticism" too, but I believe these issues are close to being resolved. I've completed it and will get it to you after the Founders Conference so you can review it closely. I want you to concentrate on your obligations for the month and not worry about this.
Also, since I live in NC, if you and Dr. Akin's folks would like to put together some collated material for an info packet on regenerate church membership/integrity in ch. membership, I'd be willing to man a table and distribute the material @ Ridgecrest. I can even go to SEBTS to help get it together if you want. My email has also changed. Just click on my profile here and you can reach me @ my new email.
Blessings,
Gene
So, if we happen to live in Louisiana, how may we obtain a copy?
Dr. Tom:
I think this is an excellent idea. Indeed, I do pray that God would move in the hearts of Florida pastors to watch the DVDs and see how biblical the Doctrines truly are. The added part about evangelism is excellent too and I think would go far (God willing) to recover a more God-centered approach to soul winning.
May God be glorified in His truth!

Tom, I'm glad to support this effort to proclaim & reclaim the the historical & scriptural foundation on which Southern Baptists stand. Perhaps God will grant us the reformation & revival we so desparately need in our day.
Brother Tom,
You said, "A similar gaffe was made last year by the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention. Their Executive Director apologized once he realized how inappropriate that action was."
Why would anybody in the position of 'Executive Director' of the SBTC...NOT understand how innapropriate that action was. I do not buy that. The damage was done. He would not give equal time to the truly representative portrayal of the D.O.G.(Calvinism). Thus, his 'apology' has a hollow ring to it, and to some degree...one must question the integrity of the man. Don Cass never apologized. That would have meant more to me than Jim Richards stock response (damage control) after the damage was done.
I will be praying for you guys in Florida concerning this situation, as I know what it felt like here in Texas last year. Similar to Brother Gene, the money is tight, but I feel like I must supply at least a few of those DVDs to the cause. Please accept my "widows mite", and know that I appreciate men like you, Bill, Roy, etc. who will stand in the face of this.
This is an awsome idea!!!
For those outside of FL., the makers of the Amazing Grace DVD have the video on sale for 1/2 price ($14.99 until the end of the month:
Soli Deo Gloria!
Tom,
have you requested any financial assistance from your state convention to assist in offsetting the cost?
it seems like a fair request to me given the circumstances. can you request an equal amount of funds used to ship the Vines message from wherever that funding came from?
being denied such equal funding would be a note worth making, on this blog and others. but let's assume the best of them first...why not request assistance from them to make this happen?
Dear Dr. Ascol,
I find this post most interesting. Especially your statement struck me: "...no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons..." Are you sure? Did you verify it?
Like for example, the verification Timmy Brister assured us in his post "Connellism Versus Calvinism: You Be the Judge." He writes as recommended by you: “Well, Tom Ascol has just verified that Dr. John Sullivan, Executive Director of the Florida Baptist Convention, has indeed mailed Dr. Vines’ messages to every pastor in the state convention - paid for with what? Yes, God’s money! Talk about cooperation!"
Further though, Dr. Ascol, you wrote on that same post "Little did I know. Not only has the denominational leadership of my own state convention given Dr. Vines a pass on this sermon, *they have used God's money* to send it to every Southern Baptist in the state!"
And, I fear there's more. In the comment thread, you morally indicted Dr. Sullivan:
“As I told a reporter today, it is immoral to ask churches to support with their finances activities that blatantly attack what those churches believe and teach.”
Now, however, you simply state "...no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons..."
I am wondering, given the severity of the indictment offered here and elsewhere pertaining to the misuse of CP monies by Dr. John Sullivan if an official apology will be offered. Is it not appropriate?
Would it not be expected if Founders were wrongly accused of misusing funds?
Grace today, Dr. Ascol. With that, I am...
Peter
Your PayPal donation link isn't properly constructed. It doesn't get me to the right place to send a donation by this means. Can you perhaps fix this or simply disclose the email address that is accepting the donations via PayPal?
It's good to see that there are still guardians in the church.
I would assist in this financially, but PayPal is incapable of taking my money.
Thanks for all the encouraging comments. Please pray for this effort.
Irreverend:
I did actually think about asking the Florida Foundation for assistance, but decided against it. It's not a bad idea, though.
Dr. Lumpkins:
I am surprised to learn that you think that the only money that qualifies as "God's money" is that which is given through the cooperative program! This must be your position or else you would not have reasoned the way that you do. Dr. Lumpkins, you and I must simply agree to disagree on this point. Let me quickly add that, if I believed as you do--that the only money that belongs to God is CP money--then I would accept your call for an apology as the appropriate thing to do. But, since I do *not* believe that the CP constitutes the sum and substance of all the money that God owns, no apology will be forthcoming for my statement that the state office used "God's money" to send out Dr. Vines' sermons.
May you have a grace filled day, Dr. Lumpkins!
When a set of CD's is sent out with letterhead from the Florida Baptist Convention with an official letter from the primary executive of the State Convention on that letterhead, promoting, I might add, what has been proposed in said CD's, that involves resources from the Florida Baptist Convention. If on the other hand, the official letterheads can be bought and paid for by an external entity and sent out to Florida Baptist pastors as an official correspondence from the primary executive in the state, then we have a serious problem which is much more severe in nature than was previously thought. And who is Eddie McClelland, President of Florida Baptist Financial Service? Isn't he to be held accountable to Florida Baptist to some extent, seeing that he is the primary CEO of a "trust" agency of the convention? And if, in fact, Dr. Sullivan was not forthright with him about the content of what he was supporting, doesn't Dr. Sullivan owe him an apology? I'm certain that Lumpkin has already made that demand of Dr. Sullivan. And I wonder if Dr. Sullivan asked his secretary (paid for by FBC) to write the official letter encouraging pastors to listen to Vine's sermons. Or did Dr. Sullivan, who's salary is paid for by the FBC, carry all of this out during his time off. What a convoluted argument to suggest that Founders in the FBC owe these men an apology. Sounds like the Democratic parties tactics. That would be akin to my church sending your church a letter opposing your views with Riverbend's official letterhead and asking you to apologiize for blasting us due to the fact that we got a guy off the street to pay for the contents. The point is, if you don't want entities to be accused of the obvious, STOP using our letterhead to promote division! And STOP allowing money given by other entities to utilize our letterhead in promoting division.
Oh, I forgot to add, were the copiers used for the mailout paid for by Dr. McClelland's money? Were those in charge of the packaging for the mailout paid for by external money? Was the time of all FBC employees who were utilized for this mailout paid for by external money?
Dr. Ascol,
Gee, Dr. Ascol, I did not so much as pen one syllable as to my own view of stewardship. Rather I simply quoted your own words back to you.
You wrote: "...no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons..." If this is so, then I am unsure what you mean in your little rejoinder to me: "if I believed as you do--that the only money that belongs to God is CP money--then I would accept your call for an apology."
Of course, I do not believe that the only money God owns is CP money. I think with you He owns it all.
But that isn't what we're talking about here. You wrote: "...no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons..." O.K., if that's so, I am afraid the moral challenge is still before you.
Grace, Dr. Ascol. With that, I am...
Peter
Dr. Lumpkins:
Wow. I hold you accountable for your words and logic and you confuse the issue by bringing up the topic of stewardship. I am certainly glad to know that don't believe that God's money is limited to the CP. Given that, why do you still think I should apologize. Perhaps you are operating on the basis of some canons of logic to which I am not privy. It seems rather simple to me:
Tom: God's money was used.
Tom: No CP money was used.
Dr. Lumpkins: Tom is morally obligated to apologize for saying the first because he acknowledges the second.
Once again, Dr. Lumpkins, you and I must simply agree to disagree on the congency of your protest.
Have a blessed day!
Sending the CDs is an excellent idea. Though in Louisiana, I am going to present this matter to our combined Elders & Deacons meeting tomorrow night. I hope we can send over some money to help our sister churches in Florida.
BTW, we are planning on sending Dr. Tom Nettles book "Ready for Reformation" to every church in the LBC (1,600+ churches). The total cost will be $14,400. We have $3,500. As you think of this matter, we would apprciate your prayers.
No surrender!

Dear Dr. Ascol,
Bravo! Very clever. I like to be clever (when I can). I like it when others are clever (like you).
The problem is, the tone of being clever is a little off-base here. Indeed, I think I know why.
Founders possesses a pretty clear record in calling for public apologies, indicting those who "slander" the DoG, publicly taking to task those who "speak evil" against the brethern, etc.
Thus, I can appreciate why you wish to sidetrack the point I make by "being clever." For me, I say that's simply peachy.
I do not know how Dr. Sullivan feels though since he probably was deeply offended by being accused of something by you but now, according to you, he did not do: "no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons."
Oh well. Chalk up one for the old clever, Dr. Ascol, aey?
Grace for this afternoon. With that, I am...
Peter
Dr. Lumpkins:
Clever? Me? Hardly. I am simply trying to be honest and encouraging you to be, as well. How have I sidetracked the point? I have tried, as simply as I know how to point out that you have falsely accused me. You accuse me of accusing Dr. Sullivan of misappropriating CP funds. I have never done that and you, despite your many efforts, have not been able to demonstrate that I have. All you have been able to do is repeat my words that "God's money" was used. When I expose the fallacy of your reasoning and encourage you to own your duplicity, you charge me with trying to be "clever" and sidetracking the argument.
Dr. Sullivan knows that I have not done what you have accused me of doing. He and I have discussed it. Anyone who reads what I have written knows that I have not done what you have accused me of doing, because my words are not hard to understand. Nevertheless, if you are determined to persist in your false accusation--which you seem bent on doing--I cannot stop you. Having done my best to point out your error and encourage you to correct your false accusation, all I can do now is to stand by and watch your credibility further evaporate with each attempt you make to confuse the issue further while refusing to own your actions.
Still, I wish you a grace filled day.
Tom,
I think you really ought to approach your state convention and let them help you. I think the cooperating churches in that state convention deserve to hear a reason why such a request would be denied...if in fact it would be. And if the request is granted how wonderful would that be?
I do strongly encourage you to make the request...the churches in that state would be served well by you making it and knowing about the response.
Dr. Ascol,
"all I can do now is to stand by and watch your credibility further evaporate with each attempt you make to confuse the issue further while refusing to own your actions."
Dr. Ascol, with all due respect, I do not think you are concerned about my "credibility further evaporat[ing]" You're not only clever, but an hilarious hoot as well:^)
You wrote three statements of interest about this:..."
Contrarily, the issue is not how Dr. Sullivan views it. After all, Dr. Sullivan is an alleged anti-Calvinist sending out anti-Calvinist propaganda. I would not rely too heavily on him as an authority were I you.
Rather the issue is whether or not Dr. Sullivan used "[churches] money" (b)--what you call "God's money" (a)--to "blatantly attack what those churches believe and teach." Unless I'm missing something in your posts, Dr. Ascol, God's money" and "[churches] money = CP money.
Now, at least the way I read it, Dr. Ascol, (c) seems to be a direct correction to the record of (a) and (b).
And, Dr. Ascol, for the record: there is no "many efforts to demonstrate you have [accused Dr. Sullivan]." I simply read your post today and noticed a glaring inconsistency: "no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons", which is directly against you've repeated numerous times and others like Brister, Lollar and Puryear followed your lead.
Come to find out--CP monies were not used: "no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons."
Peace today, Dr. Ascol. With that, I am...
Peter
It doesn't take being a Southern Baptist to see how wonderful an opportunity this is to spread the gospel! I look forward to giving what I can.
I'm not privy to the polity of the Florida Baptist Convention so I don't exactly understand all the politics involved... yet I have been a calvinistic Christian long enough to have experienced being misrepresented and marginalized!
Dear Dr. Lumpkins:
We must have used different textbooks in our logic classes! I suspect we probably used different ethics books, as well. :-)
You write:..."
Then you write:
Now, at least the way I read it, Dr. Ascol, (c) seems to be a direct correction to the record of (a) and (b).
I will certainly grant that you have the right to read it that way. But I must sadly point out that your reasoning would not convince even a freshman student of logic--unless, perhaps, he or she used whatever textbook you studied.
Though I am growing weary of pointing out the obvious, let me try to do so one more time:
The only way c would contradict a is if "God's money" is limited to "CP money." You have stated that you do not believe that (which relieves me) and yet you continue to defend a position which requires that untenable view.
The only way that c would contradict b is 1) if the only money that ever flows from churches to the state offices is via the CP or 2) if you disallow that which Dr. Hargrave pointed out, that CP monies are used to support the general operating expenses of the state offices. I must assume you must hold both views in order to make your claim.
Dr. Lumpkins, it is clear that you and I will never agree on this matter. So, this is my last response to you about it. Thanks for dropping by. Have a grace filled day!
Tom, PayPal wants to charge sales tax on this donation (I never got my extra slice of bacon in San Antonio by the way).
If we Florida pastors donate in this way, will the 6% have to be sent to the state? Would a mailed check be better for the project?
Klay:
Sorry about that! We are working on fixing that problem. The additional 6% for "sales tax" in Florida is automatically added, but we hope to take it off asap. I assure you, that 6% of any donations will not be sent to the state government.
Thanks for pointing this out. Look for your extra slice of bacon in the mail! :-)

Mr. Ascol,
I'm sure you are familiar with Phil Johnson's blog "Pyromaniacs." Mr. Johnson has just a few rules for his blog, one of which is "Don't feed the trolls." I did not fully appreciate this rule until I made the ill fated attempt to engage in a rational exchange with a certain defender of the SBC party line. That exchange drove home the importance of not feeding trolls.
Your points have been made in a clear, rational, evidence supported manner. You have presented the truth for anyone who cares to see it. My unsolicited advice is that you do not need to spend time belaboring the obvious.
Keep up the good work!
Dr. Ascol,
For you to continue to insist on your point in the face of your own words--"no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons" is beginning to embarrass even me, my good Dr. Ascol. I'd hoped you would, for all the times you've called on others to publicly retract, have better evidence than "I don't see it like you do."
Oh well, if nothing else, perhaps others will now run the resources they get on the net, doing their own research, before they climb on board the hay wagon.
To your defense your usual hit men have gone silent. I recall the last encounter here when I was only wishing well the possible coming of Dr. Nettles to your church and even attempted to offer my compliments to him. Consequently, I fell among theives, was wounded and left for dead.
The only one to your rescue now is Farmboy--whom, of course I dare not address since I remain a troll. Of course, I recall the brief exchange I had with him differently than he. From my memory, I was attempting to offer evidence as he piled on the emotive insults. If that is being a troll, then being a troll I shall be.
I hope your evening is a peaceful one. With that, I am...
Peter
I think Bro. Hargrave's comments made it quite clear that CP money did, in fact, pay for this mail-out.
CP money paid for the resources - letterhead, ink, envelopes, labels, time spent.
Plus, where does Florida Baptist Financial Services get money from? If the money was drawn from their resources (gifts from SBC churches and members), does it not in fact act as a de facto CP.
I have to question no only the ethics of Dr.Sullivan from drawing money from FBFS (while also hiding the reason for the request from McClelland)...but also his attempt to disguise this as not taking any CP and FBC resources, when it clearly did. I also view it as unethical to stamp the FBC logo on the CDs to give it credibility, but then when called on using CP funds says the FBC didn't pay for it. If it didn't, then don't pretend it did. (Again, he did use FBC and CP resources, even if it is not line-itemed in the budget.)
Highly unethical...if not purposefully misleading.
I think Dr.Sullivan needs to be reminded that he works for us...not the other way around. IMO, he's gotten "too big for his britches" the way he has made declarations and pronouncements (and decisions like this) the past few years.
This whole thing stinks...I for one am glad that there is a response. I just wish Sullivan would "man up" and address his reasons as well as answer the criticisms.
That is what any honest man of God, with nothing to hide or apologize for, would do.
At the risk of feeding "trolls" it would seem that the two of you genetlemen (Drs. Lumpkins and Ascol) are using different definitions for the same terms.
Originally I has *thought* that CP funds were used for this distribution myself, but I had wrongly equated two things that were not necessarily the same. (logical fallacy of equivocation on my part)
Since Dr. Ascol has clarified his meanings, I have been corrected as to my understanding. :)
Dr. Lumpkins, I cannot help but think that you are simply not grasping the difference in definitions the two of you are employing. From what I've seen of you on this blog, you have been amiable and have enjoyed the dialogues I've read [usually :D], though here the misunderstanding is growing and appears less than helpful.
I'll stop with what I was saying regarding it, especially since Dr. Tom has stopped and I fear I may be out of order continuing to address it. So, I'll end with this last comment:
May God move in the hearts of His people to get the funds together for this project and may His truth be known far and wide in the Florida Baptist Convention!
SDG,
dbh
BTW, Pete...maybe no one is rushing to Tom's defense because...he doesn't need defense against your statements.
Your logic is flawed. Your perspective is backwards. Your statements are condescending and underhanded.
What I don't get is how someone can be shown their error several times but still talk down to someone as if they were right all along.
For the most part you are being ignored...now I will join the throngs in overlooking your ramblings.
With that I am....back to ignoring you.
:)
Dear J. Gray,
"Your logic is flawed. Your perspective is backwards. Your statements are condescending and underhanded." Why, thank you, J. Gray. How wonderful of you to say so.
David,
I may be missing the "definition" but my question is, why would we need a technical definition in a question of this type? One recalls the classic Clintonian response: "It depends on what you mean by 'is'." Please.
Dr. Ascol himself conceded: "no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons." Splitting hairs over this is simply, well, ur, uh splitting hairs, for heaven's sake.
My simple point is, if no CP money was spent, the outrage is misguided.
Grace. With that, i am...
Peter
J. Gray:
I understand your frustration. Indeed, in many ways I share it. Let me caution you, however, about getting personal in your critique. Dr. Sullivan is our Christian brother. In many ways and situations I have found him to be a wonderful, respectable Christian leader. Obviously, I disagree with what he did in sending out these CDs. I think it was a mistake and an unwise use of *God's money" (note to anyone who may miss the obvious: God's money is not limited to that which flows through the CP).
I have spoken with Dr. Sullivan about this. We had a very cordial, even warm conversation about it. We disagree. Let's keep our comments here focused on the great good that can come out of these events if our Lord is pleased to overrule them in that way.
Join me in praying that the Lord will enable us to do what we are planning in this project; and pray that many will be challenged and encouraged in their understanding of and commitment to the truth of God's Word.
Maybe no one's coming to Dr. Tom's defense because like Peter and those bloggers he referenced they too read Dr. Tom's words as meaning CP funds not just "God's money." A less prideful person might be able to recognize that since more than just Peter saw Ascol's posts as referring to CP money he should make some attempt at apologizing for having not been clear enough in his rant (if indeed he actually never intended to imply CP money was used since there seems to be a question of ethics). Pray for humility indeed!
Praying fervently for you all in this God-honoring endeavor.
For the sake of His Truth for HIS glory.
Lisa Nunley
Gentlemen,
I agree whole heartedly with Dr. Hargrave.
There's no way that FBC funds were not used in this ordeal. Maybe there's no budgeted line item for this transaction. However, the expense of letterhead, secretarial time, John Sullivan's time, postage, copier usage, and everything else that Dr. Hargrave points out - we paid for.
So again, there's no reason to apologize to John Sullivan.
And I have a question, why are we so apologetic all the time. As if we have to defend everything we say with an apology for being forthright.
Is there no room for zeal in the life of a Christian?
Does zeal have to be smothered in the gravy of "please don't take this wrong my Christian brother?"
Man, why can't we just say it because the Bible says it?
Do we not believe like Spurgeon that calvinism is the gospel?
If so, (I certainly do) then why do we have to qualify every little thing we do so that they won't say we're mean calvinists?
Frankly, I think it's time we call it like it is and stop wanting to hold hands and sing Cum ba ya.
We're not talking about the color of the carpet; we're talking about the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I wish that our Calvinist leaders would start making that the issue because that's the issue worth fighting for.
Bro. Tom,
Thank you for your careful warning. I want to make sure that my critique doesn't become washed out by a harsh tone. Your warning is well taken.
But I think there is a need for Dr. Sullivan to step up and answer the questions that have been brought out by his actions in this regard. (My frustration stems from several years of actions and statements by him.) It is a fine line between making critiques personal and critiquing the actions and attitudes of a person.
I truly believe that his actions in this issue (and his vague statements since) are unethical. I think this was a calculated move and it was set up so that he could answer "no CP monies were used". That is purposefully misleading.
So, while I (as a lifelong Florida Baptist) am thankful for the work Dr. Sullivan has done over the years, it does not mean that I am willing to overlook unethical actions now.
I do however want to make sure that I do not attack him, as I know him to be a faithful brother in Christ. But his actions MUST be critiqued...especially since he is serving us as Florida Baptists. The line between actions and the person are a very thin one.
There are certain biblical admonitions that appear to be most applicable in the context of the blogosphere these days. Proverbs 26:4 comes to mind.
What kpcalvinist said.....
Dr. Hargrave:
Indeed, Proverbs 26:4 seems appropriate with many things going on in the blogosphere nowadays.
Thank you for bringing it to our attention.
SDG,
dbh
That's funny Cornelius!
kpcalvinist,
Amen and amen! If we truly believe that the doctrines we hold are truth, then it's time to stand up and say so. If indeed the doctrines of grace ARE the gospel, then why compromise with another one? Nobody likes division...but the truth will divide, there's no getting around it. That is unless one takes the position that truth is all relative. I'm not saying that one should set out with the sole purpose of being divisive, I'm just saying it's time to take a stand and let the chips fall where they may.2
When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the Word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed (Acts 13:48) With this and other countless accounts of God's Grace in Salvation--why does man cling so tightly to "decision theology?" Are we impugned so fervently because we dare to say that God saves sinners and actually mean it? (Actually these questions are rhetorical in nature.) I agree with the brothers who are enouraging us in love to stand...and after that, to stand. Whether in His justice, or in His mercy...He will be Glorified.
NativeVermonter says:
"--why does man cling so tightly to "decision theology?" Are we impugned so fervently because we dare to say that God saves sinners and actually mean it?"
...and let the misrepresentations begin.
Hey Dr. Tom, what happened to your sense of humor? Maybe you could bring up that post about NetFinney cause it sure is funny to mock the other side isn't it?
Tom, I absolutely love this idea and will pray with my family about how to be involved financially. Then, when this is done we can figure out how to do the same in Georgia. This is where the battle is and really where it should be. I mean at the local church level, not just in the great state of Georgia. :-)
When it comes to government, we have the kind of politicians we have because of the kind of people we are. When it comes to the SBC, in many cases (not all) we have the kind of leadership we have because of the kind of churches we have. When our churches are transformed our convention will be as well.
In fact, I believe we need to go farther than this. I think we should have a set of relatively concise but powerful documents in PDF format that can be easily e-mailed. Imagine if our people began e-mailing documents like Tom's "Integrity Resolution" or Roy Hargrave's "An Idol Called Evangelism" to everyone on their e-mail list with a request to pass it on to anyone they think would benefit. We could come up with other very attention getting titles. Let's take this to the streets.
What do you think Tom and Roy?
Tom, I am not in FL so I had to go to the Woodstock website and find Dr. Vines' sermons on Baptist Battles. I finished the sermon and let the music continue until the end of the sermon. What Dr. Hunt said at the end was even worse than what Dr. Vines said even though he only spoke a few sentences. In essence he said -- You Calvinists need to tell your friends what you really believe . . . tell them that you believe that babies go to hell!
The emotional attacks that are w/o basis are what I find most disturbing.
Paypal taxes are removed, but now there are S&H charges. BUT, I still managed to give exactly what I intended - though I did try several combinations first! :)
I think this is the most I've ever commented on a post before. :)
In any case, I wanted to chime in about how people are mentioning the importance of standing up for the truth of the Doctrines of Grace, and it is surely important.
However, someone (I think) seemed to express frustration at all of the constant attacks said Doctrines suffer and also seemed to be growing tired of being gentle in communicating our apologetic for the truth.
I would caution us to remain ever gentle as we remain ever firm. Failure to do so runs great risk of violating the Scripture's commands regarding gentleness.
I wrote this article nearly a year ago that deals with this very thing. It's a bit lengthy, but I think worth the read. There are a couple of quotes from Dr. Tom in there too that I think pertain wonderfully to the matter at hand.
May God's people be encouraged, and may our Great God and Savior be glorified.

mpaqTom
I am a frequent reader to your blog and have never left a comment. I must say that the entire debate seems to hinge on the implied meaning of…
“As I told a reporter today, it is immoral to ask churches to support with their finances activities that blatantly attack what those churches believe and teach.”
Although you have made it clear that this is not CP money, in the context of a state director and Florida Baptist Churches, one could very easily assume that you are referring to CP money. I believe that Dr. Lumpkins is reading the quote this way and thus ask for an apology only if to clarify the issue.
However, the reason I am commenting is concerning the language in which you corrected Mr. Lumpkins. Using phrases such as “freshman logic” and “evaporating credibility” I believe is beneath you. Having said that, I know nothing of your previous discussions with Dr. Lumpkins. Maybe he deserved it, but you still should not go there.
In the end, think you for your insight. I enjoy all that you write.
David G
Dr. Ascol, with all due respect, I do not think you are concerned about my "credibility further evaporat[ing]" You're not only clever, but an hilarious hoot as well:^)
One cannot tarnish a rusted blade.
Tom is castigated for allegedly saying that CP money was used for the mailing.
Peter is the one who equated "God's money" with CP money.
And now Peter is allegedly embarrassed for Tom, because Tom says that CP money was not used, and nowhere has Peter found a statement by Tom stating that CP money was used.
By Peter's own admission above, Tom has made 3 statements:..."
He sees c as a correction of a and b, but what Peter has done is make an assertion minus the argument. How, exactly, is that a correction, except on his own assumptions about a and b? One has to assume the consequent in order to arrive at that conclusion, e..g that "God's money" refers to CP dollars, particularly CP dollars spent on the mailing itself.
I would point out that Dr. Sullivan used his *position*, which does involve CP monies, via the general operating expenses of the FBC (a fact that Peter has yet to acknowledge here), to do this. If Peter has a problem with that, then perhaps he should write Dr. Hargrave or just get the FBC to stop using CP dollars to pay the ED of their convention.
What we *do* have if Eddie McClelland's admission that FL Baptist Financial Services was asked to raise money for the project, and is dismay that Dr. Sullivan used the monies in the gift for something that Brother Eddie himself says was political. Basically, that's their credit union. They do church funds mgmt, estate planning, charitable gift planning, trust mgmt, personal investing, church lending, and scholarships.
That sounds a lot like God's money at work.
What we have here, then, is a classic example of turning material into an argument before attempting to refute , ineffectually, an argument of his own making, then castigating Tom for not measuring up. That's called mirror-reading. Peter is castigating Tom for something that is dependent not on what Tom wrote, but what Peter assumed and inferred, and, as we shall see, it was Peter who made the connection.
To your defense your usual hit men have gone silent.
“Hit men.” Ah, yes, the irenic world of ad homineum invective. So much for Peter's forked tongue rhetoric about irenicism.
The reason those "hit men" have "gone silent" has nothing to do with the lack of merit to Tom's response, but the obvious illogic of your own. There is some damage that can only be done by an interlocutor who continues to make the same flawed presentation. So far, they have let you do all the work. Being the agreeable guy you are, you were drawn here like fly to paper, despite your repeated and often self-refuted claims to have no grudge against Founders ministries, Calvinists, or those who post here, and now you've gotten your wings trapped in it. You drew your own negative conclusions and then you proceeded to argue with...yourself. The whole time you called for Tom to make a correction, it was, as we shall see below, nothing more than a correction of your own making, for you drew negative conclusions on your own then proceeded to castigate Tom for negative conclusions that you drew.
My simple point is, if no CP money was spent, the outrage is misguided.
Since Eddie McClelland himself has made the comment that had he known about the purpose for which the money he was asked to raise was to be used, he would not have done so, since his institution serves "all FL Baptists."
However, even if your frame the issue without reference to “CP dollars” Brother Sullivan still used his position as Executive Director of the FBC to do this. Further, the letter does not indicate that he was acting as a “private citizen.” No, he was acting as ED of the FBC and using his access to the churches to do this. Ergo, even if we frame the issue in the terms Peter provides, there is plenty of “outrage” here.
I would further point out that, as we shall see, from Peter’s own comments elsewhere, if CP dollars were used there is, in his view, still no outrage. Peter can't seem to keep track of his own thinking, or he's since changed his mind, or he's speaking with a forked tongue.
I may be missing the "definition" but my question is, why would we need a technical definition in a question of this type.
David did not call for a "technical" definition. This is now your tendentious characterization of the term "God's money" as defined for you by Tom, a definition given to correct an argument of your own making, Please do not chastise others for answering you on your own level.
Peter can't keep track of his own argument. Tom merely answered Peter on his own level, since Peter is the one that framed the argument in those terms. Then, when answered on those terms, he complained about the answer.
I simply read your post today and noticed a glaring inconsistency: "no cooperative program money was spent to send out Dr. Vines' sermons", which is directly against you've repeated numerous times and others like Brister, Lollar and Puryear followed your lead.
Peter is confusing words and concepts. “God’s money” is a set of words. It can mean many things. Rather than actually, you know, ask Tom nicely to clarify, Peter came out with guns blazing.
What’s more Brother Peter can't keep track of his own argumentation over time, so it seems somebody will have to do it for him by actually looking at the pertinent material.
Peter mentioned Timmy Brister's comments, but where was Peter when Timmy Brister posted that? An entry from Peter is remarkably absent from that thread. If then that was an issue, then he should have said something then. Timmy did make a statement about *cooperation* not "CP dollars." These are not convertible concepts. The first mention of CP dollars in connection with this incident came from one “Davethepastor” in the form of a question in the combox, and it was not answered one way or the other.
So, yet again, we have *Peter* making that connection as fact, not the writer, and what did Peter actually say about CP dollars?
Peter mentioned Bill Lollar. If this alleged inaccuracy was a concern then, then Peter should have said something then. But here is what he *did* state then on Bill's blog:
But know nonCalvinists such as myself could slice that pie too by whinning about Dr. Nettles who teaches at SBTS, offering a point of view that not only does not
represent my views, but is far from the overwhelming majority of Southern Baptists. Do I think it is wrong to pay Dr. Nettles with my CP dollars? I do not.
(emphasis mine)
a. One cannot help but notice that in that thread, Bill Lollar had said nothing about CP dollars. I contacted him personally to verify this after looking for it myself, and for information about any other comments he may have made in unguarded fashion. He replied: "I did not make any reference to CP dollars funding Sullivan's CD project."
b. So, Peter made that connection. And, guess, what, brothers, in my original commentary @ Triablogue, I too made that connection (a correction has since been made), but I’ve also been too hopped up on Soma and Vicodin over the past few weeks to fail to notice. At least I have an excuse. Peter’s objections are remarkably absent from that thread too.
c. Speaking of which Peter apparently had no problem with the idea that if *CP dollars* were used, they should be used for such a mailing, since his own illustration involved
Dr. Nettles @ SBTS, a position paid for by CP dollars with which Peter disagrees, yet he does not find it disagreeable that he teaches at SBTS on CP dollars.
d. So, where is the outrage? He says he believes Tom falsely accused Brother Sullivan, but apparently it isn't *by his own words* an accusation with which he has a problem anyway if true, and it is, in reality a conclusion that Peter himself drew, so Peter is castigating Tom for falsely accusing Brother John Sullivan, but why? Peter is the one that actually did that himself in his own mind and in other comments, while believing and publicly stating that, even if true, it isn't objectionable at all. I see this on a regular basis from atheists like John Loftus, who throw up objections to Christianity which they really don’t believe anyway; I expect better from the Brethren.
An atheist can’t very well attack the Bible on the grounds it is immoral if s/he doesn’t believe anything is intrinsically good or evil. In the same way, it is irrational to attack Tom, Bill, Timmy, and Les, or anybody else for connecting “CP dollars” to John Sullivan and this incident if one doesn’t believe that using CP dollars for such a project is problematic. That’s schizophrenic. So, what he does is attack Tom on the grounds that he’s called on others to retract misleading and misrepresentational statements in the past, but that’s still irrational since (a) Tom made no such statements; (b) the person making the statements was Peter from negative conclusions he himself made and then proceeded to treat as fact; and (c) John Sullivan is the ED of the FBC, a powerful position that depends on CP dollars.
e. Peter stated this not because of something *Bill Lollar* stated, but because of something one *Ubergoober* stated, about "all of us" paying for it (eg. FL Baptists), and he's right, for the FL Baptist Foundation receives money from "all of us,” and John Sullivan represents “all of us” with money paid for by FL Baptist dollars. Peter was the one that made the connection to CP dollars directly, not Tom, not Bill, not even Ubergoober, you Peter, and you appeared to have made the connection not simply to his position and power, which is clearly funded by CP dollars anyway, but, as you state in this combox at this time now, regarding the mailing itself. So, framed in the terms of your own argumentation, “You are the man.”
f. Greg Alford made the connection to CP dollars reflecting on the conversation between Ubergoober and Peter. So, it seems that the term "CP dollars" there is one that was invented by Peter.
g. The only other reference I can find to CP dollars on this at Founders came from Aaron Turner in the combox of Tom’s first thread. There was no protracted discussion, just a comment.
h. Peter mentioned Les Puryear, but Les never said anything about CP dollars being used, and Peter posted one time in that thread and said not a word about CP dollars. I personally checked with Brother Les. He wrote, “I don't have to check my blog archives because I have NEVER said anything about CP dollars other than reporting CP giving percentage from the churches on nominees to various boards and agencies. When I heard about the witch hunt in Florida I did provide a link from my blog to Tom Ascol's. However, I have never personally said anything about anyone's use of CP money, much less the FBC."
Peter waited until now to raise this issue it seems, and that strikes me as eminently disingenuous, for you see, he castigates Tom for falsely accusing Brother John Sullivan for an action that, if true, he wouldn't find problematic anyway, so he doesn’t seem to really believe there’s a problem with using CP dollars for such a mailing. Apparently he’s either changed his mind secretly or he can’t keep track of his own argumentation. Ergo, he’s upset about a misrepresentation in which, if true, he does not, following his own comments at his own named sources, really believe is a problem. No, he’s concerned that Tom misrepresented John Sullivan’s actions, but that is patently false, and in fact, is a negative conclusion that Peter drew long ago on his own without any help from anybody he names and, it seems, without emailing Brother Tom, Bill, Timmy, or Les or at least voicing his concern or belief the term needs to be clarified in the combox. Further, in the midst of crying foul and holding Brother Tom accountable for allegedly bearing false witness, he bears false witness against not one, but THREE brothers in the course of a single sentence, and if you add Tom, FOUR. The only persons who have been falsely accused here are those four persons.
David G:
Thanks for your comment. I think you are correct about the interpretation of that phrase. I was very careful in how I worded things, both to the reporter and on the blog. I did not know if CP money was spent when I originally posted. Given the fact that the head of the Florida Financial Services co-signed the letter, I suspected it wasn't. However, resources that came from Florida Baptists most certainly were used. When Dr. Sullivan criticized the debate on resolution #5 last year at the SBC he wrote that he could not believe that 30 minutes of God's precious time was wasted on that issue. His words were in my mind when I wrote what I did.
Regarding your rebuke of how I responded to Peter. I accept it and thank you for it. As you guessed, there is a long history behind our exchange. Take a peek at his blog to get the most recent rounds. I don't want to be personally defensive, for many reasons, not the least of which is that it clouds the issues at hand. So do personal attacks. Where I am guilty of making such, I am without excuse. My intent was to point out the irrationality of Dr. Lumpkins' argument. He and I have often disagreed but usually because of difference of opinion, not because of an inability to draw valid conclusions from known facts. He made assumptions and then charged me with what he assumed. I reject his assumptions and stand by my very carefully selected words--words that are in print and beyond dispute.
Someone referenced Proverbs 26:4 earlier in this string. Verse 5 follows immediately after it, thus setting us on the horns of a dilemma at points. By this I do not mean to call anyone a fool, but to recognize the biblical wisdom that comes at times by refusing to engage a disputant on his own terms and at other times doing exactly that. I confess that I do not always see clearly when to do which.
Thanks again for caring enough to comment and for your willingness to address me on this.
God Bless you Tom.
I look forward to attending the meeting in November.
David G
Tom,
I'm not in the SBC but felt led to support the project. There are times when I wish I were part of the SBC, I love to listen to Dr. Mohler, Dr. Dever, Pastor Paul Washer, and to read your daily blog. I will look for a link to listen to your preaching in the near future.
I've lived out the fruit that comes from the Anti-Calvinism camp, I come from a Calvary Chapel background, where I was ordained to the ministry and then later told I wouldn't be able to teach because of my beliefs regarding the Doctrines of Grace, specifically my classical reformed view of the Atonement, they had big issues when we got to the fine print of the doctrine and all it entailed. So the issues you are facing are not limited to the SBC.
1 Corinthians 9:24
24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.
For His Glory,
Mark
This has turned pitiful. Tom explains himself. Tells us he has talked to Mr. Sullivan who does not see a false statement. FBC money was used though no CP. Tom never said it had been from a specific fund.
Who would have thought that our former graceful visitor would lay in wait to make a poor effort at an ambush. And another visitor who has been treated warmly and for the most part gently is also posting negatively.
Peter, you have yet to engage Tom, only your reading, not the actual words and intent. You have been told the supposedly offended party has no problem.
Brother you have lost me.
Greg
Dr. Tom:
Your humility is an example to us all, especially how you responded to the rebuke in this post.
Again, I have reason to thank God for you, sir!
SDG,

Dave Hewitt,
Brother, please point to me where the Scripture tells us to be gentle when dealing with heresy.
We are speaking about heresy, right?
The DVD that we are mailing out advertises a statement from Spurgeon that says "calvinism is the gospel."
If we agree with what we are mailing out, then those who say the Doctrines of Grace are heresy and a false gospel are actually teaching and believing a false gospel themselves, are they not?
When Paul addressed the Galatian church he didn't say Oh foolish Galatians who has bewitched you – Oh I'm sorry I need to be more gentle.
Paul didn't say let those who preach this other gospel be accursed – Oh I'm sorry that just slipped out in a moment of fleshliness.
Jesus didn't say in Matthew 23 You Pharisees are fools, Oh man - didn't mean to say that.
Or in John 8 when Jesus called the Pharisees sons of the devil - He didn't take it back and say that His zeal got carried away.
Please show me where gentleness is commanded when dealing with heresy.
Jude doesn't say it! Peter doesn't say it! I can't find it.
Are we to be gentle in some situations, yes!
But we are talking about the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ!
I feel that gentle has left the building.
I don't mean that we use physical force but I do mean that we draw a line in the sand and say here we stand and we are held captive by the Word of God and we will not move or give in.
If God be for us who can be against us?
No one can take anything away from us that God does not decree.
Dear Gene,
Thank you for your wonderful dissertation. And, quite honestly, I am flattered my little post drew such from you, Gene. I only wish the critique I humbly offered toward your flawed research on Sandy Creek could have garnered a quarter of the words, old fellow, you chose to direct toward this lost cause. I'm sure you disagree. But, we both know that's expected.
As for others here, I appreciate the criticism directed toward my post. Always, in my view, ideas need--no deserve--questions. Strength builds as a result.
More appreciated indeed, and oddly so, I suppose, the criticism toward me personally. I accept it--gladly. If one cannot accept without anger nor malice personal criticism, he need not crawl into the open as did I.
Some of you have implied my alleged "irenic" aura is now safely vanished away. That's also acceptable to me. I do not, gentlemen, depend upon your assessments of me to influence one way or another what I will or will not say or believe. I trust similarly the same for you.
If my interpretive powers are flawed in the particulars surrounding this entire fiasco, it will not be the only time this has been so. Nor will it be the last, I remain sure. And, contrary to some who believe my noetic view of sin smacks pelagianism, I remain a fallen creature presently even while I stand restored in Jesus Christ. I am a sinner; of course I can be wrong about this.
Nonetheless, you are sinners too, and I conclude from that, that, at bare minimum, the possiblity equally exists that you can be wrong as well.
That said, Dr. Ascol affirms he's done no wrong, along, of course, with his community here. My view is that innocence lacks--if we take the words as they are given, minus the rationalization process to make them work.
I am perfectly comfortable in admitting such divide in our "takes" on the matter. And, I am perfectly at peace with the public statments I've made about it as I am sure Dr. Ascol stands no less at peace with his.
Grace, brothers. And mercy for us all. With that, I am...
Peter
kpcalvinist my brother,
You raise some good points. The issue is this, I suppose:
Are the people we are seeking to win over with biblical doctrine our brothers, or aren't they? The Doctrines of Grace are important matters of the Gospel, and they are worth defending and fighting for. However, I am quite wary of drawing my sword against a brother in Christ.
In Galatians, Paul spoke out critically against the Judaizers because of a critical flaw in what they were saying. Instead justification by faith alone in Christ alone, they had added a human work into the midst. They were insisting that in order to be saved, someone had to be circumcised in addition to the work of Christ in order to be saved. Paul rightly condemned this as a different Gospel, which is no Gospel at all. In fact, I have recently preached on this very thing; let me know if you are interested in it.
The important difference is that we do truly believe that (the majority of) those who are currently opposing us in the SBC with regard to the DOG's are in fact our brothers. Jesus identified the Pharisees as hypocrites, which brought His strong rebuke and woes. Paul didn't think that of the Judaizers and those who bought into their lies it would seem:
Galatians 5:2.
These indeed are strong words. Even our semi-pelagian synergistic brothers to my knowledge accept that justification is by faith alone in Christ alone. Of course, they are completely inconsistent as to how they think this takes place, but that is part of what we seek to do -- educate them and by the grace of God they would embrace a much more biblical soteriology and that Christ would be glorified all the more.
I do not doubt for a moment that TULIP is critically important for the Gospel; I believe it wholeheartedly, and will defend it to anyone who denies it, but when I do so I will seek to correct them with gentleness if at all possible. If someone persists in error and does not handle the Scripture properly and with reverence, a strong rebuke is in order. When the error is public, a public response is also in order.
My point is that, especially when we are dealing with brothers and sisters in Christ, we should seek to be gentle wherever possible. I do not dispute that the time for a passionate, strong rebuke comes at times (and one can be passionate and gentle simultaneously), but unbridled zeal is rarely productive.

Tom,
Gregg Bahnsen gave this sense to Prov 24:5,6. Don't use your opponent's presuppositions in argument or you will wind up with his conclusions. Then use his presuppositions to show he can not live consistently and rationally with his own presuppositions. I don't know how this might apply here, but that has helped me in understanding those verses. Sort of in line with your comments.
As a word of encouragement, I worked with the Berean Tape Ministry in sending tapes on the doctrines of grace to the students at the seminaries and Baptist College of Florida. Some of the tapes were thrown in the trash can. Dr Lewis Lamnpley picked a set out and listened to them . He came by the Berean House and from those cast off tapes I was able to teach the doctrines of grace to a class of 7-10 black pastors for over 4 years. So let's do what we can do and trust God to do what He alone can do. By His grace alone, Cap
Bro. Dave,
I don't want this to turn in to a "you and me" show, so this will be my last.
I understand that we want them to come to the truth and we can reach out to them in love, but love doesn't always mean soft voices and apologies. Love can be shaking the dust off your feet.
You mentioned that we are dealing with brothers in Christ. Okay, let's say we are, wasn't it Jesus who rebuked Peter and said, 'get behind me Satan.'
That's a conversation to an apostle. That was pretty harsch wasn't it? Peter was probably pretty broken after that, which was likely the point.
Brokenness needs to come when you oppose the things of God.
Luther.
Thanks for the exchange Dave.
kp:
Your point is well taken. I, with Luther, have no desire to shrink back from the exposition of the truth of God, especially since it is under attack in the SBC right now.
I will, as God allows, continue to proceed forward with gentleness. If it continually falls on unreceptive ears, a more stern message may indeed be required.
My plea is simply that we exhaust gentleness before jumping to forcefulness. :) I've failed to do this on occasion, and it hasn't been a good thing.
SDG,

Hello: I've been "lurking" for some time but never commented here. In light of several comments in this thread I'm left wondering what it is in general that people think is necessary for the Gospel and so determines who are considered to be brothers & sisters.
david b. hewitt said:
"My point is that, especially when we are dealing with brothers and sisters in Christ, we should seek to be gentle wherever possible."
Without meaning to pass judgment on someone(s) I've never met, should those who hold to Arminian and, as is more often the case today, even Pelagian-like teachings automatically be considered brothers & sisters in Christ? And if so, on what basis? I don't deny it is possible to be trapped in this system and yet be born again (even before the reformation during the dark ages there were glimmers of light). But if a person holds to man's ability to choose God at any time, then they are really practically denying all 5 points of Calvinism in some way even if they don't admit to it (someone else stated above that Spurgeon equated Calvinism with the Gospel). How can a person have been brought to the point of utter helplessness, see that there is nothing they can do to be saved, and so rest completely on the grace of God but yet then say that it was in their ability to come to this point or that others can decide to come to this point as well? The theology would seem to contradict experience if there really is experience. Unless I am mis-reading him, Luther is pretty clear in Bondage of the Will that if one is really holding to free-will in the way that Erasmus seemed to be, then they are denying the very foundation of the Gospel and by implication the Gospel itself. Is Luther right? I'm not denying that believers can unwittingly hold to teachings that they really deny in practice, but is that really the case most of the time today?
Perhaps this thread is wearing out for so many questions, but I would still be very interested to see some more dialog about this.
a.shroeder,
I'll let the academia fill in the details but as I see this whole issue it's like this: every person's whole theology swings on the hinges of how they answer these two questions:
1) Something happened in the garden. What happened and what was it's consequence?
2)Something happened at the cross. What happened and what was it's result?
Everything else hinges on those answers.
hisbygrace:
If I believe that (1) Adam & Even fell in the garden & by consequence all mankind is trapped in sin and then also agree that (2) Jesus died on the cross to save sinners such as me and has propitiated the wrath of God against my sin, should I then conclude that I am a Christian and have been born again?
a.shroeder,
My point is this: the real issue for me isn't whether I can call someone a brother if their understanding of the gospel is not mine...someone could know the doctrines of grace and be able to argue theological points front to back...but I can't look into that person's heart and know with 100% certainty if he is converted or not. The question for me is, can I truly cooperate with someone who holds to doctrines which are contrary to my understanding of the gospel? ie: going on a mission trip to take the gospel to a people group where one believes in a decisionistic gospel and whose goal in evangelism is to evoke a "decision for Christ" from an individual, and the other is willing to tell that same individual that he is a sinner, dead in trespasses and sin, and helpless to do anything about it? Can two walk together unless they be agreed? The answers to the two questions, for me at least, is a determiner as to whether I can truly cooperate with someone in the gospel.
hisbygrace,
I just read your comment from earlier agreeing with kpcalvinist and would agree as well. My only point in bringing up the calling of someone a brother was just to ask why we would generally assume someone is a brother who holds to doctrines that are contrary to the very foundation of the gospel? That's not to say that just because someone understands the gospel intellectually that they are converted, though ("you must be born again"). You raise good questions. I would add also: Should we even be calling "Christian" a system of theology that is contrary to the foundations of gospel?
I am convinced (rightly or wrongly) as a layperon that the biggest stumbling block we have to the Doctrines of Grace is one word: Calvin.
He was just a man and none of us want to go back to a state church with magistrates and Baptising infants. Why even mention his name when discussing or teaching election? If he is credited with 'systemizing' theology, then why not just teach it out of scripture.
I hear more about 'Calvin' in reformed circles than I do about Jesus Christ. I believe this is a great failing of a most beautiful truth of scripture.
Someone once said that the SBC is many but not much.
The Texas and Florida mailouts are too coincidental to not have been carefully discussed and planned. What you are doing Tom in helping make the Amazing Grace DVD available is honorable. Wish Texan pastors had the same oppty to receive.
genembridges is correct in that the main objective is the reform within the churches. At a local SBC church, the new pastor upon taking office last year immediately changed the way we received new members. Gone was the three-month waiting period of evaluation. Instead, he reinstated the usual "Walk Forward/Join the Church" process. He did this arbitrarily, without consulting the deacons, without consulting staff. There were not many protests.
The mindset of "walk/join" is the macrocosm within the convenetion. The mindset needs changing first and foremost before any serious discussion can take place about church membership.
The pessimist would ask whether any serious discussion (theological, ecclesiological) can even take place at large within the SBC, where many leading evanglicals wonder about its theological astuteness.
Dr. Ascol,
I hope you will reflect on the comments on this thread.
Many times you have said that non-Calvinists are too afraid of Calvinists.
Maybe you can see here that some of it is not imaginary. There are many Calvinists out there who can scarcely imagine that a non-Calvinist could be saved. Non sometimes meaning 3 or 3.5 points.
You have said that you can count non-Calvinists as brothers. There are plenty of Calvinists out there who only see non-Calvinists as embracing a false gospel.
Karen:
Thanks for your comment. You raise a very important point about how I operate this blog. I have tried to be clear about my views on the issues you raise. And I have acknowledged that some with whom I agree theologically are just as a great a hindrance to reformation and true fellowship through arrogance and lack of love as are some with whom I disagree.
In the "guidelines" that are available through the hotlink on the right of the page, I explain why I grant great leeway in what is put in the comments here. It is not because I agree with everything or approve of everything. Rather, this approach allows at least one measure of the kinds of thinking and attitudes that are "out there." Here is part of the rationale:
."
Perhaps it is time for me to rethink this policy and tighten the ground rules for commenting. I am open to that. In one sense it would make it easier on me.
Thanks again for your comment. Please don't allow those on the radical fringe (which is how I would describe those guilty of the views you mention) define how the majority of those committed to reformed theology think or relate.
I sometimes describe myself as a 5-point Calvinist who is not mad about it. I think that is true of most of us.
Lin Said,
"I am convinced (rightly or wrongly) as a layperon that the biggest stumbling block we have to the Doctrines of Grace is one word: Calvin."
Lin, though I understand your thinking, I must respectfully disagree. I think you are oversimplifying the matter. As another layman who has been a member of 3 different Atlanta area SBC mega churches, I can assure you that the vast majority of "Christians" in these churches know nothing of either Calvin or Spurgeon. They are just names that they hear from time to time from the pulpit when certain quotes suit the pastors message.
On the other hand you have the gatekeepers of the convention that should be well aware of the difference between Calvin and Spurgeon, the doctrines of grace and Presbyterianism. If they don't, who is responsible for their ignorance?.
Lin, we can try to use terms that may be less offensive, but unless the Spirit works on their hearts they won't accept the truth either way. Our only option is to speak the truth in love and let the chips fall where HE wills.
."
I know and understand. That is the whole point. Our allegiance should be to the Word ONLY. Election: It is in there, plain as day.
"Lin, we can try to use terms that may be less offensive, but unless the Spirit works on their hearts they won't accept the truth either way. Our only option is to speak the truth in love and let the chips fall where HE wills."
Friend, I must have not communicated well. It is NOT about being less offensive or politically correct. It is about glorifying God and His Word..not 'mans' words. My goodness, we have enough following of 'man' out there.
I have often wondered why the other 'side' does not refer to altar calls as "Finney's" or decisions for Christ, "Grahams". :o)
Grace and Peace of our Savior to you, friend.
Karen in OK said:
"You have said that you can count non-Calvinists as brothers. There are plenty of Calvinists out there who only see non-Calvinists as embracing a false gospel."
I'm not sure who in this thread that is directed at, but I'll attempt to bite since my comments might seem to imply something along these lines. First, I would not consider myself a Calvinist. In recent times everyone has their own definition of that term and so using it can be very misleading and generally I've found it's not very helpful. Yes, I believe that (1) man is utterly dead in sin by nature and those who assert that man has some natural ability to do good are really denying the concept of original sin and by extension the very foundation of the gospel. But if I believe this, it follows that (2) salvation is utterly 100% grace and is not caused by anything in man because there is nothing in man to cause it. To believe otherwise is to deny the first point, not to mention a great deal of Scripture. It then follows (logically & Biblically) that if some are saved and others not, that (3) this decision is entirely of God. To deny this is to deny the second point, which is then to also deny the first. From this it follows Biblically that (4) God has not decided to save every single human. To contradict this is to be a universalist. To deny it is to deny one of the previous points and by extension the rest of them. Then, if the cause of salvation totally rests in God and His will, then it follows that (5) those who He wills to save WILL be saved. Again, to deny this is to deny the rest of the points as well. If this is true (and I am open to discussion), then so far we can see that these 5 points (which some call 4 of the 5 points of Calvinism) all stand or fall together. If someone denies God's choice or election, we must attempt to see the motivation for why they are denying it. If it is simply that they have heard bad things about mean Calvinists, then that is understandable. But if the motivation in denying it is clinging to the free-will of man (and so the bound will of God to man) then their view of God and man is contrary to the foundation of the gospel itself. I am not saying that such a person absolutely cannot be a born-again believer, but I am saying that what they believe is contrary to the Gospel. It's not just some minor points or secondary issues. It's the Gospel itself.
Now, is the assumption that what I am saying is motivated by a hatred for people and a love of Calvin? Or could it perhaps be motivated by a love for God and a burden for many who are decieved to see the truth of His character?
i'm not a five point calvinist. i believe in salvation by grace. i believe that only thru the death of Jesus on the cross is what's gonna get me into heaven.
do yall think that i'm saved?
i'm not a five pointer...i believe that man is a free moral agent who makes real choices and has responsibility for his choices.
do yall think that i'm saved?
david
Hey VolFan, are you shaking your head with me and thinking these people haven't got a single clue what it is we actually believe and why?
volfan007 said:
i believe that man is a free moral agent who makes real choices and has responsibility for his choices.
All so-called "Calvinists" I know of also believe that man makes real choices and has responsibility for those choices. That is not the issue. The question is, what do you mean by "free moral agent" or what is meant by free-will? Do you mean:
1. Man is free to choose God without God first giving grace. Or,
2. Simply that man always acts according to his will because his will is really his greatest desire and man always acts according to his greatest desire. Apart from God first working grace, man's desire will always be sinful and never for God.
If #1, then how can one really claim to hold to a salvation of grace when the "cause" or motivator of the salvation is one's own decision apart from grace? In that scenario, man himself is the root cause of salvation, not the grace of God. #1 leads to a gospel of human ability not grace. #2 is basically what Jonathan Edwards, the reformers and most other "Calvinists" actually believe (perhaps except for a very very small number of historical hyper-calvinists, but I've never actually met one that I know of).
a.schroeder, here's the problem - you're taking one part of what you think you know about our "system" and putting it through the filter of your "system" and stating that it's illogical. And the question isn't is it logical but is it scriptural.
volfan007:
Just another quick point -- just because you believe those things does not mean that you are saved. In fact, just because somebody believes the 5-points of Calvinism does not mean they are saved. True faith does not reside solely in the intellect. The love of God must be in the soul and there must be some spiritual sight of the glory of God (faith). I'm not making any judgment about you -- based on what you just said I would neither assume you are a believer or an un-believer. On the one hand, assurance of salvation is the work of the Spirit. On the other, we can at times say with a good deal of confidence that somebody is NOT a believer, especially if it is clear that they deny the gospel (not just in mis-undertandings of words).
David,
I am thoroughly reformed. I believe you are truly saved if you are relying on the death of Jesus alone for your redemption. However, as one convinced of the doctrines of grace, I believe your understanding of grace falls short of the Biblical revelation. Sort of like Apollos needing to be explained the way of God more adequately. I mean all of that as humbly as I can. I have simply never found adequate exegesis by a non-reformed theologian on passages such as John 6, Ephesians 1 and 2, and Romans 9; not to mention the way election is portrayed in the Old Testament in persons like Abraham.
Mary,
"these people" probably isn't the best way to converse with anyone, much less Christians, as it at least flirts with condescension. I, for one, would assume I have quite a clue about non-reformed beliefs. After all, I grew up in them (Arminian/general Baptist principles) for 18 years, fought against the doctrines of grace for a number of years after that, until about 5 years ago it finally clicked for me. I am not alone. I assume many of the brothers here were non-reformed before they were reformed. This does not prove the reformed faith, but it does disprove your notion that we are just plain ignorant of what a non-reformed Christian believes.
If you want to speak to the superiority of your views contra the doctrines of grace, I am all ears to see what I could learn. Seriously. I am not beyond convincing there could be better understandings than what I currently have. I will need some convincing after your comment above that you are really interested in things of such substance.
Well Brian, by all means sense you know exatly what it is I believe then please make corrections to the multiple errors in this thread. Thank you for the welcome to this blog.
Oh and Brian, you didn't just flirt with the condescension you married it. Don't hurt yourself patting yourself on the back for having evolved into a higher form of Christianity than us mere mortals.
Thanks Dr. Ascol, I see nothing ever changes here at your blog.
Condescension oozes off the computer screen as always along with caricutures and misrepresentations.
Mary:
What exactly is "your system" that I don't understand?
I agree that we must be Biblical, but I also believe that the Bible is logical & if there are contradictions, then the problem is with our interpretation of the scriptures not that the Bible contradicts itself.
What the question comes down to is this: What is the final & ultimate motivator of salvation? Is it the grace of God or something in man? Does God choose who He will give grace to or does He simply forsee what man will choose and act accordingly?
do you all think that i preach a true Gospel message whenever i'm not a five point calvinist?
david
Brian,
I have a question for you. You have written that you are "throughly" Reformed. Are you sure ? Do you mean that you are Padeobaptist? Are you Amill in your Eschatology ? Let me go on record that I am . Do you let the unbaptized join the visible church ? Do you let them take the Lord's Supper while being unconverted and unbaptized ? I trust that you mean when you say that you are " throughly Reformed " that you mean that Salvation is of the Lord, High view of God and low view of man, You believe in Church Discipline, Regenerate Church membership and so on.... ? It is so important to be clear these days in Baptist circles. The reason why I ask you these things is because I am teaching seven new potential church members that are visting our church on Thursday nights a class on Baptist History, theology . One of the couples who are Baptist said " We are looking for a Reformed Church and my wife and I are " Reformed to the Core". My response was really" Are you Reformed to the Core or are you a Calvinistic Baptist as I am and our church" . As we discussed what the differences were they said " We are Calvinistic Baptist". I mean no harm or aggravation toward you but we need to be clear on this blog that we are Calvinistic Baptist rather than " Throughly Reformed".
Volfan007,
First, you ought to be ashamed that you are not an Auburn fan. I already forgive you. You could be worse and be like Timmy Brister in being an Alabama fan. Please tell me as UT man that you and I share a major dislike toward Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide of Alabama ? It would help when asking your question if you will tell us what you believe the gospel to be then people could answer your question better. BTW, I got some inside info that it has already been Predestined that Auburn wins the SEC championship this year however you guys are still responsible in showing up and letting Auburn and Georgia " Tear you Boys Up" ! Ha Ha !
volfan,
I believe someone who is not a "calvinist" can absolutely preach the true gospel.
I think most of us were saved under the ministries of men who were not "calvinists" or in churches that were not.
My question is a flip of that: do you believe "calvinists" preach the true gospel? I'm pretty sure YOU would say yes. But if you think it is the position of most non-calvinists that calvinists actually DO preach the true gospel...then why is there such rancor and hatred in the tone that "calvinists" are talked about and talked to?
mary,
Why such condescension and vitriol in your tone?
If you want to discuss these things, I think a much wiser plan of attack would be to ask questions or discuss Scripture passages...rather than coming and 'talking down' to people on here. You mentioned the arrogance of people here, but something tells me you didn't think about how arrogant that accusation was.
I think you'll find that if you openly discuss things here, the tone will stay friendly.
JG
BTW, volfan, I don't think your non-calvinist views distort the gospel...but being a Vol fan certainly does. :)
Go Gators!
J.Gray,
In the introduction to The Bondage of the Will (Packer/Johnston translation) it says the following: "The man who has not practically and experimentally learned the bondage of his will in sin has not yet comprehended any part of the gospel; for this is the hinge on which all turns, the ground on which the gospel rests." (page 45)
It's also been said that Luther thought this was his most important theological work. The question becomes, is Luther right? Is a denial of free-will in the way Erasmus presented it that important? If so, I can think of quite a few major implications. If not, then shouldn't we at least admit that we are more in line with Erasmus' side of the argument than Luther's?
We have drifted considerably beyond the original purpose of this post. For that reason, and because teh ground being covered now has been sufficiently covered elsewhere (on this blog and other blogs), I am closing out the comments.
Thanks for participating. Pray for this project.
Press on!

Impressions from IWEEE 2010
by
Luis Falcon
The first International Workshop on e-Health for Emerging Economies -
IWEEE 2010
- has been a success.
In these three days, we have had the oportunity to learn the reality from personalities coming all different parts the world: Uganda, Canada, Belgium, United States, Rwanda, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Germany and Switzerland.
We heard Ans de Jager (War Child) talking about the need of energy for the kids in Northern Uganda; Carlos Travieso (ULPGC) using biometrics to identify aborigins in Costa Rica for Medical purposes; Pedro Herranz (Caritas) explaining the huge gap among the "North and the South"; Dr Caminero discussing the links between poberty and tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS; Cesar Brod and Corinto Meffe (Brazilian Government) talked about how free software is being used in the public sector. Dr. Moses Isyagi explained how they've been doing telepathology in rural areas of Uganda. Dr Carmen Martín (Red Cross) talked about the efforts being made to help the elderly and the people with special needs.
On the technical side, Mark Höller and Thomas Karopka (German IT Center) talked about adapting Medical for Nursing and the need for convergence. Norman Young (Clear Canvas) showed us a demo how open source is working in the field of Radiology. Raúl Zambrano (United Nations) talked about the rol of the United Nations Development Program and the importance of free software as a public good. Rayco and Alfonso García (ULPGC - OSL) talked about the COREi project. We had the visit of Dr. Bernardo Agudelo and Juan José Vélez, from the University of Antioquía, Colombia, who demo the use of free software in a red-code protocol. Dr. Etienne Saliez explain the need of having a working group that include multi-disciplinary team of doctors and scientists.
Finally I talked about our NGO, GNU Solidario, and the Medical project in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
The slogan for this congress was
"The Human Factor"
, a key concept missing from many of other e-Health events. IWEEE 2010 has been focused on the human factor, considering that health is a human right, and that all the contributing factors - education, access to technology, employment, nutrition, family affection, energy, peace, ... - must be also met in order to have healthy individuals and societies. The round table discussion among the multi-disciplinary representatives (NGOs, government, church and UN) gave all the participants the opportunity not only to expose their realities, but to discuss possible solutions to the most urgent needs.
Organizing an event like IWEEE is a great challenge, and, even though we had been working non-stop for a year there where high expectations that we had to deliver. Finally, I must say that those expectations have been met, and that we have been asked to organize IWEEE 2011, again in Canary Islands, which we have already started to do. My gratitude to Fundación La Caixa, the University of Las Palmas (specially to Fernando Real ), Consejería de Sanidad (who provided the Hospital Auditorium) , Colegio de Médicos de Las Palmas, Gran Canaria Turism and Innovation Bureau, Cabildo de Gran Canaria ( specially to Carmelo Ramírez ) and to Juan Montero from UNESCO.
My gratitude goes to all of you who have participated and donated your time, experience and knowledge, putting them in the hands who need it most. I'm looking forward to seeing you again in IWEEE 2011.

Now Available! NEW Edition of the Digital Highways
January 31, 2012 by Good Sam · 5 Comments
We’re kicking 2012 off with a NEW edition of your favorite RV magazine – Highways! This edition is packed with excitement from cover to cover, complete with your favorites such as Tech Topics and Chapter Chat and also includes important Good Sam news beneficial for all members. The Club’s recent announcement about the combination of the former President’s Club and the Good Sam Club and the new, money-saving benefits available to all members is broken down to give you even more details on just how you can take advantage of these great new features and in turn, getting the most value from your membership. Additionally, the new Highways provides you with a thrilling guide to the natural wonders of the 49th state, Alaska, and it also highlights the exhilaration that is scheduled to take place in other states for the three 2012 Rallies! As if this weren’t enough, the excitement of this edition climaxes with the announcement of this year’s RVer of the Year (drum roll, please)! So what are you waiting for?
Start reading the Digital Highways online now!
Highlighted Articles:
Your new online issue will not load, it tries but don’t go past 98%. Click on it several times and waited up to 10 minutes.
The whole issue with the digital Highways magazine is a poor reflection on Good Sam. The problem Ed Borland described is probably due to the fact they PDF file are huge (45 MB is not needed). The whole concept of the pdf is to provide a smaller file for electronic transmission. The files need to be optimized. A computer screen can only display 72dpi so there is no reason to load up the file with high resolution pictures. If you go back to pre May 2011 and look at the archived files that worked you will find a solution. This is not the first time I have brought up the problem and a suggested solution to no avail. I think we the members have really lost with the new management’s approach. They don’t seem to care about the people who pay their salaries. Get the webmaster to get it right.
I just tried to download archived copies and no matter what issue I requested the same on was downloaded so it doesn’t work.
Good Sam says: Roger, we apologize for this inconvenience. This issue has now been corrected. Thanks for your patience and for being a Good Sam member.

Go Green with Grand Geneva during Earth month 2011
11 Apr, 2011
This April, the AAA Four Diamond Grand Geneva Resort & Spa invites travelers to commemorate Earth Month by experiencing the array of eco-friendly amenities and services available across the property. With features ranging from an on-site electric car charging station to native grass preserves located on its award-winning golf courses, Grand Geneva — the only Travel Green Wisconsin-certified resort in Lake Geneva —has made innovative, eco-friendly strides throughout the past two years. Recently, the resort announced impressive findings of its environmentally efficient boiler system, which will allow the Grand Geneva to save 30,000 gallons of water and reduce its CO2 emissions by seven tons per year.
“We understand that travelers have an ever-growing interest in green destinations, and were ecstatic to learn the significant conservation results of our efforts,” said Grand Geneva Managing Director Brett Sundstrom. “We are proud of the environmentally friendly business practices that are currently in place, and we are committed to building upon those in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint.”
Throughout the month of April, travelers are encouraged to take advantage of the Grand Geneva’s green features, which include:
1. Electric Car Charging Station: Last year, the Grand Geneva became the first resort in the Midwest to offer an on-site charging station for electric, plug-in automobiles. Manufactured by Coulomb Technologies, the ChargePoint Networked Electric Car Charging Station is complimentary to both guests and the general public, meaning that electric car owners living as far away as Chicago can now travel to the Grand Geneva and back without spending a penny on transportation.
2. Natural Herb & Vegetable Garden: Executive Chef Robert Fedorko grows organic, fresh produce on-site that is used in his award-winning cuisine at the resort’s signature, restaurants Geneva ChopHouse and Ristorante Brissago. The garden also serves as an educational tool for the resort’s culinary students, who tend the garden and track its growth.
3. Green Golf: Golfers who hit the links at the Grand Geneva’s Highlands golf course will note the tens of thousands of square feet of the course dedicated to native grass preservation.
4. Local Bottled Water for a Cause: All bottled water served to guests on the Grand Geneva campus is tapped from natural springs in nearby Chippewa Falls and bottled by employees of Goodwill.
5. 100% Smoke-Free Indoor Environments

Ladies, we know how important your makeup is to you. We know how often you splurge on new mascara or brushes to keep your makeup collection in tip-top shape. But we’ve all been there– you suddenly loose your favorite new Lady Gaga limited edition lipstick in your bottomless purse or ruin your brushes in the midst of travel. So, we’ve identified some tips and products to help you keep your makeup collection fresh all year round!
KEEP IT OR TOSS IT?
We’re always wondering if we should keep our six-month-old eyeshadows and face creams or run to the store to purchase all new beauty products– we’re sure you’re wondering the same. For beauty tips, we’ve looked to Mario Dedivanovic, a celebrity makeup artist whose work has been featured in top magazines (he shares celeb beauty secrets in his tell-all blog).
We first asked Mario about mascara. How do you know when it’s expired? Mario says, “Mascara will begin to go bad after about 2-3 months. When the wand comes out looking dry and flaky, it’s time for a new mascara. Another simple way to tell when your mascara is too old is by smelling it. After a few months of use, mascara tends to get a very bitter smell – similar to vinegar in my opinion. If something smells abnormal like that, close it and toss it.” Since we all love luscious lashes, this is definitely a tip worth remembering.
Next comes foundation. Especially for liquid foundation, Mario says if it “begins to seperate in the bottle and change colors, please do yourself and your skin a favor and get rid of it. Products that contain oils will eventually go bad and will certainly accumulate all kinds of bacteria.” What else can’t Mario stand? Filthy sponges. Mario tells us “wash your sponge at least once a week. It takes a few seconds to wash with soap and water. Reusing these sponges over time and not washing them will be more harmful to your skin than anything else. If you dont want to wash them, you can use a new sponge every time and toss it when done. Every pharmacy has bags of disposable sponges that are fairly inexpensive.” Washing your sponges will keep your skin and your makeup fresh– good to know!
KEEP IT ORGANIZED
Most of us have a simple makeup bag that holds absolutely everything we need to keep our faces looking pretty. But, we’re here to tell you that there’s a much better way to store your makeup. A cosmetic travel pouch is lightweight, washable, and has specific compartments for all your makeup essentials. You’ll finally be able to see what you have (or don’t have), and can keep items secure in your purse or while traveling.
Another solution? A purse organizer.
Instead of taking their entire makeup bag, many women will simply carry a lipstick, mascara and blush for touchups. The problem? We know how many other items you carry in that enormous bag of yours. So try a purse organizer– it fits right into your bag and has exterior pockets to hold anything and everything (including makeup)! A cosmetic pouch or purse organizer will help with Mario’s final tip: “Try keeping liquid and cream products including lipsticks and glosses away from the sunlight. Instead, store them somewhere dark and cool like a drawer or medicine cabinet.” There you have it, ladies. Now go clean up those makeup bags!

For years, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. (GMCR) has awarded grants to improve the quality of life in coffee-growing communities around the world. Now, for the first time in the history of our philanthropic giving, we’ve chosen to fund a supply chain project within the United States related to our growing portfolio of non-coffee products, with a $125,000 grant to the Madison House Youth and Community Center of Yakima, WA.
Mad Yakima Valley.
“It was a natural fit,” said Rick Peyser, Director of Social Advocacy and Supply Chain Community Outreach for GMCR. “We are pleased to be able to support Madison House because the organization provides much-needed services to the people who pick and process our apples.”
This $125,000 grant will fund adult education at Madison House, including scholarships, program materials and supplies, a full-time adult education coordinator, GED testing fees, and childcare.
“This partnership represents an exciting opportunity for both organizations to expand efforts to reduce generational poverty,” said Sara Holtzinger, Madison House Development Director. “To change the culture of our communities, we must work to change the culture of our homes. That’s why adult education, and the childcare that’s necessary to support it, are so important.”
We were introduced to Madison House by representatives of Tree Top, a grower-owned cooperative that operates eight fruit processing facilities in Washington, Oregon, and California. “Good things happen when people work together to care for communities within the supply chain,” said Sharon Miracle, Corporate Communications Director for Tree Top, Inc.
We’re excited to continue our supply-chain outreach through grants to organizations like the Madison House Youth and Community Center.

Single Shot: Vancouver Drain Cover
Many times, pedestrians don’t ever take notice of drain covers, but we love finding new drain cover patterns. Surprisingly, they are great inspiration pieces for denim hardware and patterns. This frog and tadpole patterned drain cover was found in Vancouver, BC. Thanks to Mary Quite Contrary for the find!

The.
It's a good thing many people not as wise yesterday are much wiser today!
Obama's campaign of an uninsured man who lost his wife to cancer.
How dare his administration exploit a man's emotions to convince the man to publically blame someone totally unassociated to the situation, imply murder! For one: he neglected to pick up on his wife's symptoms of her illness or that she was ill. For two: insurance doesn't care. It's a piece of paper that never stopped anyone from getting medical attention before obama. For three: no one should use the lack of insurance to hold them back from getting medical care! Health care is only as good as the hands you put it in.
5 people close to me died since Obama's been president. NONE of old age or naturally. The social care as obamacare has been infiltrating private insurance for years. All 5 were insured. All 5 were living independently, self reliant, not tax burdens to society. ALL but one experienced great medical neglect observed by visitors whom also observed horrific manipulation of the conditions enduring, CAUSING their death. To suggest insurance saves lives or cures cancers is misleading and distorted! People save or kill lives and cure or create cancers!
Isn't this against the law, oh I forgot Obama doesn't care about the law.
IF Big O is paying these folks out of his own pocket, it is NONE of our business. HOWEVER, if they are being paid out of the taxpayers' coffers, THEN it is public information covered by the "Freedom of Information Act." Perhaps there is a way to get this information after all . . . how about we SHUT OFF THE MONEY until the POTHUS and his minions TELL THE TRUTH for a change!!! Are they paid out of a secret checkbook or something? Why can't we just ask for the information and receive it without such a struggle every single time?
And lastly, where have the watch dogs been for the past four years that this is only coming to light now and the questions are FINALLY being asked?????
The most "transparent presidency" in history, isn't. Obama said that just so he could get elected. He's as transparent as Nixon.
barrys rule: it does not matter what you do as long as you win. the laws be damned"
Wow! You mean Obama's regime is not the most "transparent" in history? What a surprise!
This what happens when the progressive elite run the country. They use our money to promote themselves. The "Word is out" this photographer is being paid twice; once by the white house and again by the obama campaign. and maybe even a third time since:. The only thing I couldn't find is who in the white house he is related to.

. They’ll each be signing their latest releases after the lecture; tickets are going fast – get yours here. Last week, Rollins gave us a sneak peak in his own guest blog; this week Berry talks about the upcoming lecture.
Fiction into reality? That’s a little backwards for me. What I do is turn reality into fiction. I like to find something from the past—the Amber Room, the lost Romanov children, Charlemagne, the tomb of Alexander the Great—items or artifacts you may not know much about (but, hopefully, would enjoy exploring), then weave a modern day tale around them. The kind of stories I’ve always like to read have a mix of secrets, conspiracies, history, action, adventure and international settings. So it was only natural that I would write that same kind of story.
Every novel for me starts as a treasure hunt. I’m searching for bits of reality that somehow can be woven together into a coherent plot.
And it’s not easy.
In fact, the challenge is to find the most unrelated stuff as possible, then relate them through a twist of the facts. While doing this, I have to always keep in mind that I’m not writing a textbook, it’s a novel, whose primary job is to entertain. But that doesn’t mean the reader can’t learn some stuff along the way. I enjoy that aspect, and I’ve come to learn that my readers do too. I’m careful, though, with my twisting, and I make sure the reader knows where I played with the facts by including a writer’s note at the end of each of my books.
In Houston, on January 19th, Jim Rollins and I will be discussing all of this. Jim’s books are a little history and lot of science, mine are the other way around. But we both definitely like to tinker with reality. For me, every book involves around 200 -300 sources obtained from many trips to bookstores; lots of internet browsing; and at least one visit to a locale important to the book. I have, for days, sat in a German Cathedral (The Charlemagne Pursuit); roamed an abbey in Portugal (The Alexandria Link); scoured Paris (The Paris Vendetta); climbed citadels in southern France (The Templar Legacy); boated all over Venice (The Venetian Betrayal); and wandered through the Kremlin (The Romanov Prophecy).
But that’s all part of the job.
So drop by January 19th to the museum at 6:30 and spend an evening with me and Jim Rollins. Have your questions ready. See you then.
An Evening of Thrills: How Science and History Make Great Thrillers will take place on Tuesday, Jan. 19 at 6:30 pm. Both authors will sign copies of their latest works after the lecture; copies will be available for purchase from Murder by the Book. Tickets are available here.

“Feet don’t fail me now”… thus begins the debut disc from New York native, Lana Del Rey. The title track from Born To Die starts the disc off on the right foot, but clearly she’s walking with two different feet.
By the end of 2011, I had heard the name Lana Del Rey as much as I heard the name Adele. Without hearing a single note of music from the girl, she was exploding through the critical stratosphere, propelled by the song “Video Games”.
Fast forward some weeks later and my first exposure to Del Rey’s music, much like many others, she appeared on Saturday Night Live. Like watching a deer in the headlights, I thought her appearance was one of the show’s skits. Del Rey injected “Video Games” with the passion of a corpse and appeared more awkward than the freshest of freshmen at their first day of high school. It was uncomfortable at first, and then I decided to stop the pain and go to bed.
Clearly she wasn’t prepared for such a national/international stage and it turned me right off the girl. With the backlash that followed, I began to feel sorry for her, starting to chastise her management for throwing her to the wolves like that.
Since then, Born To Die came out and while resistant at first (the album sat on my desk for a couple of weeks) Del Rey’s face stared at me, almost daring me to give it a listen.
The verdict? Surprisingly good actually, but songs can be split into two teams: one where she applies a more hushed, smokey tone that will appeal to an older demographic; the other. definitely to aim for her own age demographic. Del Rey’s deep voice on “Born To Die” recalls the somber tones of Mazzy Star’s "Hope Sandoval," and was enough to make me instantly rethink my initial dismissal of her. The song’s sweeping strings and muted beats compliment the range of Del Rey’s voice nicely and while it would be easy to tread into adult contemporary territory, the lyrics and production lend it a current and vital vibe.
The album is hit and miss from there. The hits “Blue Jeans”, “Video Games,” and “Born To Die” are definitely worth the price of admission alone. These are the songs that wear well with the evening gown. I can almost picture her singing these in place of Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet.
The misses for me are the tracks where Del Rey sounds like she’s channeling Britney Spears. While this poppier stuff might find a home on the Top 40, ultimately they are forgettable and it will be the slower, almost Florence and the Machine style, that will continue carrying of Del Rey’s torch.
The girl is new and I should cut her some slack. She’s new to her feet, but given the dual personalities, she will need to decide which foot fits her best.
The following guest blog is written by Indigo's Regional Assortment Analyst, Andrew Rodwell.

When I was a teenager I learned to play several musical instruments. Of all of them, the guitar was my nemesis. Give me anything brass or with a reed I could play passably well, or at least not terribly, but the guitar required practice and dedication. I just wasn’t that dedicated and my interest waned over the years. A few years ago I finally admitted defeat and sold my acoustic guitar after a decade of disuse. But it would have been great to play the guitar as an adult. I love music and I truly admire musicians in their skill and artistry.
Evidently Gary Marcus, as he writes in Guitar Zero, admires their skill and artistry, too.
Guitar Zero is a little bit A.J. Jacobs and a little bit Steven Pinker. Gary Marcus wants to learn how to play the guitar before he turns 40, though he has no previous musical training…or obvious talent. Marcus describes his musical adventure in adult learning with establishing the challenges of learning the guitar over, for example, the piano. Marcus explains how learning the guitar is much more difficult than learning the piano due to the many different ways a guitarist can play the same note. Each note on a piano is assigned a unique key, quite unlike the guitar. Examining this difference leads Marcus to explore how the human brain understands music, both as a listener and as a player.
Marcus is interested in what makes great musicians great. Physical dexterity is one of the characteristics needed for virtuosity. Great guitar players, he points out, have very fast and dextrous fingers. To me, the most interesting observation Marcus makes, is that virtuoso performances often manipulate timing and tempo to highlight the lead performance. If the lead performer plays just a few milliseconds ahead of their accompaniment, their performance will be noticeably more prominent to the listener.
And how the listener hears is as fascinating as the how the musician plays, especially the trained listener, such as a musician or a producer—who can hear things in the music most people do not notice. Musical structures create musical narratives or even jokes - if you know what you are listening for. By the end of the book, Marcus can listen to Miles Davis and understand what he’s doing with his musical choices. This deeper understanding leads to a deeper appreciation of music.
Throughout Guitar Zero Marcus asks and attempts to answer many questions: Can a person learn to play a musical instrument later in life? And learn to play it well? Is there a critical period where a person is most apt to pick a new skill? Professional thinkologist Malcolm Gladwell postulates that to be good at something you need to have done that thing for 10,000 hours. That may apply to many activities. Is this true of music as well? Can a person be born with musical talent? Does it give you a leg up if you come from a family of musicians?
I found Guitar Zero to be an engaging exploration of the cognitive geography of music and the human mind, and the social aspect of music making. As noted above, Marcus’s most compelling and reverent theme is that of virtuosity; how some musicians can understand music so well—with its mathematical and often bizarre rules—that they can break those rules, improvise, and perform compositions that are greater than the notes from which they are composed. Marcus does not answer the question of where virtuosity comes from, but that is alright, as long as there is beautiful music to listen to and gifted musicians to play it.
Steve Martin is a man of multiple talents. Known to many of us as an actor in films like The Three Amigos! and Father of the Bride, Martin has also written the bestselling novels Shopgirl (which he adapted for a film) and An Object of Beauty. He also plays banjo with his bluegrass band, The Steep Canyon Rangers.
His newest book, The Ten, Make That Nine, Habits of Very Organized People. Make that Ten. The Tweets of Steve Martin, is a collection of his witty tweets that have gained him 2.3 million followers on Twitter. You can read an except of this very funny book thanks to HBG Canada.
Read below, as Steve Martin answers questions on his Grammy wins, the perils of the banjo world "beefs," and his inspiration for The Tweets of Steven Martin:
Q: One more Grammy and you’ll catch up Taylor Swift. Is the prospect of winning another still exciting?
Steve Martin (SM): I want to win not only for the glory and the pleasure of defeating the other nominees, but also for the glory and the pleasure of defeating the other nominees.
Q: Do you have an acceptance speech planned?
SM: I don’t, but I do have a copy of Alison Krauss’ acceptance speech for her last 37 wins.
Q: Are you friendly with the other nominees in the bluegrass category?
SM: I have met all of them and liked all of them until now.
Q: Are there banjo “beefs” similar to those in the rap world?
SM: Similar, except we use poison.
Q: Most indelible banjo moment in pop culture?
SM: They are too not-numerable to name.
Q: What sort of expectations/hopes/fears do you have about playing [the Stagecoach Festival]?
SM: We have played Bonnaroo, the New Orleans Jazz Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival. That said, I didn’t know I should be worried about playing Stagecoach until just now.
Q: And then there's the book [out on Feb. 21]. What was your inspiration, in 140 characters or less?
SM: I am very excited about my Twitter book, which is released on February 21, because it

An Oral History of Grunge
The Nonfiction Blog is pleased to share this piece
from Indigo Bookseller (& all around music nerd)
Jordan Ferguson.
I'm sure everyone thinks the music of their adolescence is superior to everyone else's, so I can admit to a slight level of bias here. I was 14 years-old in an autoworker commuter town when Nirvana's Nevermind dropped 20 years ago. I was primed and ready for a musical revolution. And yes, it's easy to sneer at the dingy flannel shirts and the Doc Martens, and the unspoken competitions to determine whose hair could get the grimiest. There's no legacy to be found in the current musical landscape, but it doesn't change the fact that grunge was a real moment, arguable the last one in the history of rock music. The success of Seattle inspired similar movements in cities across North America, like Halifax and Hamilton. Even in Amherstburg, Ontario where I grew up, it seemed like everyone had started a band. Why wouldn't we? The underdogs were breaking through, and if it could happen in Seattle, it could happen anywhere.
But how did it happen? How did this handful of bands, connected only by a shared locale, capture the imaginations of a generation?
This is what Mark Yarm's Everyone Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge. What makes the book successful is right there in the title: inspired by the Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain's punk classic Please Kill Me, it's an oral history, the story told by the people who were there. And it's a story that goes back farther than most people might realize. Many of the musicians who would go on to form Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden were jamming around Seattle with each other in the early-to-mid 1980's. The Deep Six compilation album, considered to be the “big bang,” of grunge, came out in in 1986. This is fertile material to wade through, and Yarm, a former editor at Britain's Blender magazine, talks to everybody, not just the members of the most famous bands, but lesser known acts like The Melvins and Tad, as well as bands forgotten by all but the most hardcore of completists like The U-Men and Malfunkshun. It's a fascinating story of egos and drugs, starring a bunch of charming and charismatic musicians, most of whom were woefully unprepared for what the success machine would do to them.
For someone who grew up with this music, consuming every magazine article and taping every performance and interview I could find, Yarm's book is a fantastic read. Less concerned with analyzing what it all meant, what the music's success said about the world, Yarm steps into the background and lets these characters, over 200 throughout the book, praise and snipe at each other (Courtney Love is, not surprisingly, heavily demonized throughout). It's sometimes hard to get a bead on where the truth lies, as different people contradict each other multiple times throughout a chapter. But as the saying goes, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.
The benefits of getting older can seem few and far between, friends. But you can always count on the passage of time to bring a nostalgic re-examination of that short moment when the music that mattered to you mattered to everyone, when you wrote bad poetry in spiral-bound notebooks, when it actually felt like you ruled the world.
Everybody Loves Our Town comes highly recommended not only for fans who remember the time, but for all fans of musical history. Learn more about the book, and celebrate the music it chronicles, at grungebook.tumblr.com. Those looking to continue their studies can turn to Kurt Cobain's Journals [frequently quoted in Yarm's book], Seattle journalist Charles Cross's Cobain Bio Heavier Than Heaven, the earlier oral history Grunge is Dead, Pearl Jam's recent retrospective Twenty, and the classic documentary The Year Punk Broke, chronicling Nirvana and Sonic Youth's 1991 European tour.

Special thanks to Jordan for contributing – and interested readers can see a (long) interview with the author here.
This review generously provided by Jordan Ferguson.
On August 11, 1973, DJ Clive Campbell played his first gig, a back-to-school party organized by his sister Cindy in the rec room of their building at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx, New York. Campbell, a native Jamaican, incorporated elements of what he saw in the dancehalls of Kingston, including the tradition of “toasting,” where a DJ would talk to the crowd over the music. Campbell had also noticed that the dancers seemed to get more excited by the short instrumental ‘breaks’ found in the bridges of popular funk and soul songs, so he began isolating them and stringing them together in longer sequences. The kids loved the breaks, and the man who became DJ Kool Herc [a riff on his schoolyard nickname of Hercules] christened the dancers break-boys, or b-boys.
On August 11, 1973 DJing, MCing and breakdancing combined in one place for the first time, and the culture that became hip-hop was born.
So while I might be a little late to the party, I wanted to share with you what I consider a few of the best books on the culture and the music.
Total Chaos: The Art and Aesthetics of Hip-Hop, edited by Jeff Chang
Chang’s other book, the essential Can't Stop Won't Stop has already been deservedly praised in this space (here) as probably the best book on the history of hip-hop, so I wanted to give this lesser known work some exposure. A collection of essays that acknowledges rap is a music, hip-hop is a culture, and looks to educate and inform on the other arts that fall under that umbrella, including graffiti, literature, photography. Most fascinating to me were the essays on hip-hop dance, which are compelling reading for someone who doesn’t know their top-rocking from their footwork, like me. Lots to love here.
Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies, by Brian Coleman
Being a fan of rap in the 1980s and 1990s was a somewhat mysterious practice. The artists still weren’t getting any mainstream press, so it was impossible to learn anything about your favourite acts. The most you could do was squint at the production credits on your cassettes, which usually gave you nothing. Coleman’s book succeeds in filling this gap, collecting oral histories on the creation of both classic and, well, not so classic albums from rap’s golden age.
The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop, by Dan Charnas
How did hip-hop and rap go from the regional and isolated hobby of a passionate few, to a global and more importantly lucrative cultural movement? On one side you have the artists and musicians, Charnas’s book gives the other side, the story of the radio DJs, club promoters, record labels, artist managers and ad men that recognized ignoring hip-hop was leaving money on the table. From how Sprite used hip-hop to snag an NBA sponsorship away from its own parent company Coca Cola, to why 50 Cent is a more visionary businessman than anyone gave him credit for, every story in this book was new to me, and I can think of no higher compliment to give it.
Part memoir, part lyrics book, part director’s commentary, Decoded is many things at once, and succeeds at all of them. For a nerd like me, the highlights are the footnotes sprinkled throughout his rhymes. Many might be obvious to fans, but some provided genuine insight to the inside references and wordplay Jay-Z makes in his rhymes. That alone would probably make the book worth a read, but add in the unusual candidness with which he discusses his hustler’s life in Brooklyn and you have not just a memoir but a love letter to the art by one of the best to practice it. The paperback version of Decoded releases in November 2011.
Book of Rhymes, by Alan Bradley
The more you read books on hip-hop, the more you come to see how political a lot of the scholarship is. That’s all well and good, since hip-hop has historically been the reaction of an oppressed people to the systems that hold them down. But it’s still poetry, and Bradley’s book actually remembers that language and its manipulation is a key component to hip-hop and rap. Breaking down styles of rhythm, wordplay, style and signifying, Bradley lays out what makes the greats so great, and what makes the art so compelling if you really pay attention to the complexity that goes into its creation.
… and finally, a book I don’t have my hands on yet, but will quickly get added to my library.
Def Jam Recordings: The First 25 Years of the Last Great Record Label
In 1984 a party promoter named Russell Simmons was growing tired of the disco-tinged rap that was starting to cross over onto radio and into the clubs; he didn’t think it accurately reflected what was going on in the streets. He liked more aggressive, beat-driven music. Music like ‘It’s Yours,’ a minimalist, pounding track by rapper T La Rock and co-produced by a 21-year-old NYU student named Rick Rubin. When Rubin met Simmons, Def Jam Records went from a vanity label Rubin ran from his dorm room, to the most influential rap label in music history. From LL Cool J to Public Enemy to Kanye West, Def Jam has been integral to the creation of some of the best music the culture’s ever produced, and this slick hardcover from Rizzoli promises to be as beautiful as it is informative.
There are others, of course: the dated but still hysterical and super informative Big Book of Rap Lists from the merry pranksters of Ego Trip magazine; public intellectual Michael Eric Dyson has a few books under his belt, including a celebrated biography on the life of Tupac Shakur, Holler If You Hear Me, and the The Anthology of Rap is an admirable resource for those who want to further investigate the work of the great lyricists.
Happily, hip-hop didn’t turn out to be a fad after all.
If you’re a 26 year old rocker, pushing 27, you may want to consider slowing down on the partying a little bit—that is, if there’s any truth to this myth—the Forever 27 Club—which seems to indicate a need to chill out on the substance ingestion (outside of Cobain, perhaps) before it goes a little too far.
The usual suspects on this list are Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain, and sadly, there’s a new member, Amy Winehouse. My colleague Michael Gallagher posted a great blog about Amy’s passing a couple of days ago, which can be found here—I agree with him; of the ‘club members,’ I’ll probably miss Amy’s artistic output most of all.
There’s no shortage of books on these compelling personalities – here is a look at some of the best of them.
For a look at the idea of the 27s, short stories about all of them, shared in the context of the concept (idea, urban myth, whatever you want to call it), Eric Segalstad has put together a work that highlights this legend in his book The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock and Roll.
If you care to read about some of these icons individually, here are some of the best biographies out there:
While not a book specifically on Brian Jones, True Adventures of the Rolling Stones by Stanley Booth is, I think, the best book on the Rolling Stones—(I know, it’s a bad cover, but it’s a great book). The book’s structure alternates chapter by chapter; one chapter will describe the genesis of the band, and the next will focus on their 1971 US tour. Brian’s life and contributions are covered in great detail; some of the most memorable sections include Booth interviewing Jones’ grieving parents, who are still wondering where it all went wrong. A reliable work where Jones himself is the focus is Brian Jones: the Untold Life and Mysterious Death of a Rock Legend.
For the Hendrix fan, the title to check out is Room Full of Mirrors, a meticulously researched biography that tracks Jimi from birth all the way to the end. Another great Hendrix bio is Becoming Jimi Hendrix: From Southern Crossroads to Psychedelic London, the Untold Story of a Musical Genius.
There are two schools of thought on biographies: those by the detached outsider (and often these can go the sordid route of the unauthorized and gossipy type), and those by the insider. One of the best Janis Joplin biographies out there is by her sister, Love, Janis.
Jim Morrison was the next unfortunate musician to join the club: Stephen Davis’ Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend is a definitive biography. This is by the guy who wrote Hammer of the Gods, so you know he knows how to write a rock and roll book. No One Here Gets Out Alive is the other definitive work on Jim Morrison and the Doors.
Charles R. Cross’s Heavier than Heaven has become a go-to work for the fan curious about Nirvana. Somewhat controversial, the book does include fictional aspects that does speculate on events where no research was available. Of course, going directly to the source is always a good idea, and Kurt Cobain’s own Journals are no doubt the best look directly into this subject. Cobain Unseen is another informative work, more visual than text based.
And now we come sadly, to the newest member of the club. Currently unavailable, but certain to come back in print soon (as well as new works, no doubt), are two books on Amy Winehouse: Amy Winehouse: The Biography and Amy Amy Amy: The Amy Winehouse Story. A biographical documentary is available on DVD: Amy Winehouse: The Girl Done Good: A Documentary Review.
Another DVD is available, Amy Winehouse: I Told You I Was Trouble two live performances and a documentary, released shortly after the release of 2006’s fantastic Back to Black album.
The fifth day at the 2011 Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest was sadly my last day.
Aside from Day 4’s surprise storm and exodus before The Black Keys came on, the week was filled with great music and the most fun I’ve had in a field packed with other people. My body missed the routine meals and not walking in the heat so much, but overall it was well worth it.
Day 5 was clearly the busiest day of the festival to that point, all the beer gardens swollen with the thirsty and lineups testing the patience of a saint. This was little a small obstacle to me in my quest for a couple of beers and a decent viewing area for the enchanting Erykah Badu.
Families, boys, girls, you name it, packed the second stage area in time for Ms Badu’s 8 PM set time. However, she did not show up in a timely fashion following the announcer’s introduction. By 8:30, the crowd finally grew restless, as her set had to be finished by 9:30 to make sound room for the headliners on the main stage.
All was forgiven as Ms Badu and her very capable band quickly locked in a groove with bass so heavy I’m sure the Parliament buildings shook. Over the course of an hour, Badu touched upon most of her catalogue for her first visit to the nation’s capital. Always a classy performer and in possession of great wit and an uncanny ability to engage a crowd, Badu left after an hour with her band still playing and a crowd that quickly realized they would have to wait until her next visit to get more.
The Tragically Hip closed Saturday on the main stage with the biggest crowd I’d seen all week. As the final notes from Erykah’s set rang out beside the main stage, Kingston’s favourite sons were firing up “Blow at High Dough” followed by “Grace, Too”. Possibly too eager to begin the festivities, front man Gord Downie shouted out words almost to the point of strain. We decided to venture around the festival grounds to give Downie some time to settle down.
The other stages failed to offer anything worth parking ourselves for, so it was back to the Hip who were tearing through “New Orleans Is Sinking” (featuring “Nautical Disaster” in the middle of it). Downie was still doing his Downie thing, but the shouting had subsided. Mark came out as a closet Hip fan so we stayed until the end, making him happy, joining legions of other happy people.
A refreshing cool breeze accompanied the summer evening warmth, making it a great night to enjoy the company of beautiful people enjoying live music on day 3 of the 2011 Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest.
You may not have heard of Gregg Gillis, a.k.a. Girl Talk, the Pittsburgh mash-up maestro. Mixing hip hop raps over rock, alternative and pop hits, an hour of the man is pop overload. I’d never seen the man but heard his performances were legendary. I was surprised to run into an old friend, one I would have never have expected to be there, who said “It’s not my thing at all, but Girl Talk was the best time last year”. My friend turned out to be right.
I’ve been on the fence about the artistic merit of Girl Talk. Many argue he just pushes buttons, but I don’t think it’s quite that easy. The man obviously has quite the ear for mixing songs you’d never think to put together. The songs Girl Talk combines and his manic energy for what he’s creating make for a euphoric atmosphere. Flanked by an elaborate lighting rig and about 50 fans dancing on stage, Gillis dropped 90 minutes of the most fun to be had at this year’s Bluesfest.
We heard snippets of Black Sabbath, Kylie Minogue, Ludacris, Beyonce, Michael Jackson, Pixies, Phoenix ... and I could go on and on. It was impossible to stand still, although my friend, unimpressed, did just that. But when the chorus of Nirvana’s “Lithium” came on, the entire place erupted into complete blessed abandon. Shivers went up my spine as thousands of people threw their arms in the air and exclaimed “Amen” or “Yeeeaaaahhh”. The experience was religious. I guarantee anybody at that show will never forget it. Some may want to, but they won’t.
After that, things were a similar anticlimactic experience as Day 2. Steve Miller got underway on the main stage and his sound was pretty muffled from our vantage point.
Venturing over to the Subway stage, Stephen Marley was paying homage to his father. The field was packed and we stayed for a few songs until growing restless.
David Clayton-Thomas of Blood, Sweat & Tears fame was definitely not our thing at that point in the evening, so it was back over to Steve Miller for a few more songs. The sound had greatly improved and “Take The Money and Run” surprisingly inspired clouds of cigar smoke. But the euphoria from earlier in the day waas not to be matched, so it was time to soldier home.
So the recent postal strike had more of an impact on my life than originally thought.
On the first day of Bluesfest, those who ordered tickets online were forced to suffer through punishingly long lines to pick them up. Thankfully I picked up my tickets before the park even opened, but my buddy Mark begins what will turn out to be a two-hour wait to get in.
If you’re in Ottawa to attend any of the Bluesfest, I highly recommend picking up your tickets at one of the offsite outlets, unless you are built with some strong patience and even stronger shoes.
We arrived as Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros were playing. We got to hear them from outside the park and I must say I was impressed with I heard and I’m now inspired to do further research on them.
One of the main reasons I’m here is for Oklahoma City’s The Flaming Lips. The Fearless Freaks return this year, relegated to one hour on the second stage. They still bring their full psychedelic carnival presentation, complete with frontman Wayne Coyne, wading through the crowd in a large bubble to start the proceedings.
The setlist draws mainly from their most recent albums, other than a detour to the old days via “She Don’t Use Jelly,” the closest the Lips have come to a hit.
After a beautiful sunset, loads of balloons, graffiti and a crowd sing-a-long to “Do You Realize?” they’re gone, but have inspired a celebratory start to the 2011 festival.
Not exactly continuing this vibe are Seattle boys Soundgarden, who have reformed after 14 years apart. Their tour started last week in Toronto and tonight they close the first day on the main stage, with a solid two hours of heavy hits. I did see them a few times back in the early 90s and tonight I catch the first half of their set (whilst still waiting for Mark to get in). The sound fills the packed field nicely. They seem genuinely enthused about being there, but some spark is missing. I need my celebratory vibe to continue…
The party that began with the Flaming Lips concludes in an almost religious form with a funky, frothy and fantastically flashy set courtesy of funk freak Bootsy Collins. Collins slings a mean bass and practically shook the trees from their roots with his frantic funky jams, including revisiting his old days with George Clinton in their Parliament/Funkadelic days. It’s a fantastic way to end Day 1 and even my hips continue to sway long after I’ve departed the park.
Spring was like one long episode of Punk’d this year—replaced with a lingering fall. At times I did lose hope summer was coming and we would end up plunged back into the depths of autumn and winter. Fortunately, summer has finally smothered the nation and people are now safe to abandon their extended hibernation.
My favourite thing about summer is not the weather. In fact, I’m a pasty Irish guy that wilts in the heat. What I love about summer is the ability to gather outside with a number of like-minded individuals and enjoy some live music. Festivals seem to be popping up out of nowhere, trying to establish their niches and capitalize on the success of Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, Coachella and the like.
There are many festivals across Canada over the summer, catering to almost any whim. They’re an inexpensive and fun way to discover new sounds and meet new friends. I’ve made my way to Ottawa for Canada’s biggest music festival, the Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest. For 13 days, Lebreton Flats Park plays amazing host to hundreds of bands spread over several stages. Check out the lineup and performance grid here. If there’s an act you’d like to recommend me seeing, please do!
I lived in Ottawa for seven years and watched this event grow slowly and surely into what has become, for me, one of the most anticipated music events of the year. So for the next 5 days, I bring to you the hot and sweat-soaked sounds from the 2011 Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest. Enjoy!

To get the look of our skiing ‘Starring You’ video, we used half licensed footage of a real person skiing and half in studio footage of us playing around on skis in front of a green screen. The last step was creating an avalanche of snow for the ‘Starring You’ skier to escape. So we up and bought 20 pounds of baking soda, got out some black cloth and trash bags and got creative as we tried to recreate the look of moving snow.
We built miniature mountains, spun snow with drills attached to paper towel rolls and pushed loads of baking soda all over the ground, requiring a massive cleanup effort! Check out our array of techniques below and the finished video here!

Thinking on Drinking: Collecting
At last count, which was just a couple of weeks ago, I'd lived in 26 different houses/apartments in seven states (some duplicates) over the past 11 years, not including places where I'd been for just a couple of months. My lifestyle wasn't exactly an ideal pairing for collecting wine, but for half that time I toted around a bottle of 1997 Limerick Lane Zinfandel given to me by a fellow wine-loving friend when I graduated from Sonoma State University. I was supposed to drink the wine when I published my first book of poetry. After a few years and a few states I downgraded that requirement to the publication of my first book, period. I finally opened the bottle in 2006 when I published my first big article in the San Francisco Chronicle; it was on pomegranate cocktails. The wine, a bit rusted at the edges, was just starting to decline, but it had lovely (and appropos) pomegrante fruit notes, plus earthy tones and hints of violet and lavender that were buried beneath the bold fruit upon release.
"Do you have a wine you're saving for a particular occasion?"
Leave a comment below and tell us what you're saving and what for!

Now for our final post on the Student Satisfaction Survey. In addition to asking about the facility and website, we questioned students on their use of, and satisfaction with, the library’s Access Services and Research Services. Access Services include circulation, course reserves, and Interlibrary Loan/Borrow Direct. Research Services include the reference desk and research consultations. Overall, 50% of respondents use the Circulation Desk from a few times per month to a few times per week. An additional one-third uses the desk a few times per semester. Reference Desk use, of course, is less than that of circulation. 46% of respondents use reference from a few times per semester to a few times per month, while 6% use the desk quite frequently—from a few times per week to daily. Students are more likely to use reference as they progress through their law school careers with 35% of 1Ls never having used the desk, while only 12% of 3Ls report never using the desk. As expected, journal staff members use reference service more frequently than other students. Research consults, which are a more focused and time-intensive service, have been used by 1/3 of respondents.
Student satisfaction with Access Services is noteworthy. 90% of those who have used the Circulation Desk are mostly to very satisfied, 42% of users are very satisfied. 73% of those who have used course reserves, and 73% of those who have used Interlibrary Loan/Borrow direct are mostly to very satisfied. While more users of course reserve report being “mostly” satisfied as opposed to “very” satisfied, this is likely due to the availability constraints caused by high demand of certain items.
Student satisfaction with Research Services is similarly high. 78% of those who have used the reference desk are mostly to very satisfied with 35% reporting being “very” satisfied. Research consults are a big hit: 54% of students who have had a research consult are mostly satisfied, while an additional 38% are very satisfied. Most research consults were for either a class paper or a journal note the student was writing.
Comments on the core services, and the Law Library generally, were plentiful. The library is appreciative of both the very positive comments and the constructive ones. Representative responses to the question “What do you like most about the Law Library?” include:
- “The large amount of resources and the helpful staff.”
- “The librarians. Seriously, you guys are great.”
- “I enjoy interacting with the library staff. They have always been able to assist me with my research and to help me track down a source. Thank you.”
We also asked the question “What do you like least about the Law Library?” This yielded numerous constructive comments, which overwhelmingly focused on the physical plant. As noted previously, space and temperature issues featured prominently. Representative comments on service issues include:
- “There should be more transparency in the carrel assignment system.”
- “Not enough copies of core hornbooks on reserve.”
- “You should allow ILL/borrow direct for books which are on course reserve.”
The library really appreciates these comments as they flesh out the numerical ratings and help us to prioritize items that need to be addressed. The comments regarding course reserve comport with the numerical ratings. These comments will assist both Access Services and Collection Development personnel in making decisions to improve the student experience.
Finally, to gauge interest in additional research services, we asked students “Would you be interested in attending one-hour research workshops presented by the library on a specific topic?” Three out of four indicated that they are somewhat to very interested in such workshops. Related comments were made in response to a question on what else the library should provide. These include:
- “More research trainings.”
- “I wish the librarians taught more for-credit classes on legal research, especially research for transactional law.”
Overall, the survey confirmed that students are quite pleased with the Law Library and the plethora of services the library provides. It also helped confirm that students do have facility-related issues with cold temperatures and limited space, especially group study space. The survey also highlighted areas within the direct control of the library that need to be addressed, specifically the carrel-assignment procedure, availability of course reserve materials, and the policing of noise and food.
The Law Library greatly appreciates all of those who took time to complete the survey. The feedback, both positive and constructive, is helpful in assessing what works and what does not, and in charting a course for the future. And congratulations to our prize winners: Joseph Pohlkamp (2L) won the reserved study carrel for next fall, and Lilian Balasanian (3L) won the $25 Cornell Store gift card. Awesome!

Before Google, search engine builders thought that the way to organize the Internet was like an index, or, to use the term that was popular at the time, a directory — A giant list of every link on the Internet. Librarians saw a place on this wave also, as Steve Coffman wrote recently:
Remember those heady early days when we thought we were going to catalog the web? … Almost every library felt the responsibility to stuff its website with long and often elaborately annotated lists of web resources for just about everything.
As Matthew Reidsma says, the list-making urge is still much in evidence on library websites:
Libraries love links so much that most [library websites] look like spam link farms, designed to trick Google. Every other successful website on the planet gave that up in the late ’90s, but not libraries. We librarians like to see a big list of resources because it makes us seem more relevant.
As Reidsma has discussed in other works, the problem with the prevalence of link lists on library websites is that users ignore them, and don’t find the really important things on the website … or they just go to Google.
Why do users find library lists so unappealing? Neither of the commentators quoted above, nor anyone else that I’ve seen, has written about it, but the obvious answer, I think, may be … Alphabetical Order — Invariably lists of links on library sites are alphabetical — In the days of PageRank, how boring!
The “I’m Feeling Lucky” PageRank Revolution
Before Google, the only rational way to organize a long list of links on the same subject was alphabetical order. It’s almost hard to imagine back to those days, and to realize what a revolution Google’s PageRank was. It seemed like magic that Google gave us automatic lists of links, with the best ones at the top of the list. James Gleick wrote about this recently, in a retrospective look at the Age of Google [boldface added]:
PageRank is one of those ideas that seem obvious after the fact. But the business of Internet search, young as it was, had fallen into some rigid orthodoxies. ….
With this great new invention of PageRank, people soon came to assume that any list of resources worth looking at would, of course, have the best links at the top of the list. If they encountered an alphabetical list, their eyes would glass over. So, with most long link-lists on library sites being in alphabetic order, is it any wonder that they’re not very popular with users?
So what can libraries do? As Reidsma has been saying recently, we need to look at our websites like our users do, and change them to fit users’ needs — He says from his work with users surveys that this means greatly simplifying library websites. Link lists should be short, with someone’s idea of the “best” links at the top. As I’ve learned with my work on Hardin MD, no matter how long the list of links is, only the top 2-3 will get many clicks.
The emphasis on simplifying our websites, of course, fits very well with the mobile revolution. The small screens of mobile devices beg for small, simple web pages, and trimming our lists is a great place to start.
Eric Rumsey is at: eric-rumsey AttSign uiowa dott edu and on Twitter @ericrumsey
Don’t know why users find it unappealing but I can guess why it is so popular on websites.
From experience one of the reasons why librarians or other people like to order options alphabetically is because it avoids political arguments on who to put on top. Once someone starts to argue positioning based on importance it will open a can of worms. Usage data would be nice but often unavailable, so will be based on gut feel, which is obviously going to be messy.
So many just take the safe way out as Alphabetical lists are more defensible….
Aaron, That’s a good point that I hadn’t thought of — No doubt politics is an important part of why alpha lists are popular. As a matter of fact, Matthew Reidsma’s discussion of the role of politics in making library websites fits in well with your observation.

Hey everyone!
By now everyone has at least been through one round of finals this year. So I don't have to mention how stressful they are, but I can give you some tips about what you can do to avoid all that stress you are experiencing.
So when you are stress there are a few different routes you can go on, stress eating or stress relieving. If you choose to only read one option, I wont judge, weve all been there before.
Stress eating:
So for all of you who have walked out of that exam feeling terrible and just thought to yourself, cake would make this all better. I would consider you a stress eater. Now if you choose to solve your stress problems that way, be my guest because it's just another way to deal with your emotions and the frustrations you encounter. So I am going to share my favorite foods to stock up on for finals week.
1. Goldfish
Now these don't just have to be cheese flavored, I opt for the chocolate chip and smores flavors most times. But I also like the pretzel ones too! They are just so handy and easy to munch on when you are studying.
2. Chez Mix
I love chex mix! It is so easy and it also has so many different flavors and pretzels, wonderful right?
3. Cookies
Any cookies will do, but chocolate is my go to. I like to know that after I feel like I cant study any more, there is that little burst of energy waiting for me which tastes good too.
4. Pasta
This is one of my favorite dinner type foods to make during finals week. Mainly because it gives you a little time to take a break when you are cooking it. Also those carbs are great for energy and keeping you going during those long nights!
5. Pizza
I would choose to have some spare pizzas around mainly because they are so easy to make, and you can just put them in the oven, set a timer, and keep studying!
Stress Relieving:
So if you are less interested in eating your feelings and more interested in getting rid of that stress the healthy way, here are some tips for you to improve your study habits!
1. Eat breakfast
The most important meal of the day, weve all heard that right? Well its true! You need that energy in the morning, especially if you are going to be studying all day! So eat something high in protein to get your body jumpstarted for the day!
2. Exercise
I think that it is very important to stay active throughout this stressful week. At times it just gets to be a lot to take on for your body and working out can really help you loosen up and take your mind off of the studying for a little while.
3. Sleep
It is so important to make sure that you are sleeping each night. I know that you might be tempted to stay up until midnight to finish that module, but make a realistic cut off time for each night. Trust me, you will be so much more able to study effectively if you give yourself breaks.
4. Go Outside
Now that the nice weather is finally back, go outside! It is important to get a little bit of sun, it will make you feel happier too! Also think about all that vitamin D, I'm sure your skin and small intestines will appreciate it!
5. Relax
Take a much needed break! Spreading out your study times is really key to remembering information. There is no way that you can retain all that material if you don't take a second to slow down and realize what you are doing.
Well, hopefully these tips really help you with finals week! Don't forget about all the food that will be at Usquare! That will help save you some time!
Happy Finals!

So many of you have seen my journey through my undergraduate education throughout these blogs for the last year and as you have read, its been a fun and long path that I have chosen to take.
As many of you pre-med undergraduates know, first comes the MCAT then comes the AMCAS/AACOMAS applications. For those of you just deciding on medical school there are two types of doctors, MD and DO. MD doctors attend allopathic schools and DO doctors attend osteopathic schools. The main differences between these two professions is the focus on the patient. While both professions are focused on curing the patient and accommodating them along the way, there is a significant difference about the views of a DO doctor. A Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) is able to perform many tasks that a MD physician is able to do such as prescribing medications, specializing, performing surgery. However they are specially trained in the musculoskeletal system which is considered manipulative medicine. This is hands on training that teaches students how to examine both the mental and physical body in order to diagnose the patient.
If you want to read more I have found this information here:,
I have a personal connection with DO programs through the diagnosis of my cousins autism disorder. I have noticed what a difference it makes for people to sit down and listen to the whole story rather than just prescribing medication from one 30 minute appointment. I think that it is important to have a holistic approach to medicine because the patients stories are often a crucial detail that I think can be very easily overlooked. While working in the admissions office at school and volunteering as the receptionist that the Gift of Life Transplant House, I have learned that listening to histories is important. At times there are moments where the people I talk to are nervous and apprehensive about decisions that they will be making, I think that this is an important aspect to consider when determining which path is right for you to go down.
Enough about me, and more about the application...
So it was supposed to open on May 1st, but then I went to the website and they moved it a week to May 8th. For someone like me who is a strategic planner, this is not a good thing to do at the last minute! Although I am happy that it was moved back because now I can focus more on the essays that I am going to have to complete for the application and I can take my time in receiving my transcripts to use throughout the process.
Although I have not seen the application yet, I have been doing my research and there are some significant differences between the MD and DO application services so make sure that you are aware of these when you are getting ready for your year!
These applications are open for about a month before you can begin submitting, so I would suggest to do your research and writing before hand in order to get those applications in on time. Most admissions are on a rolling basis so the sooner the better. Also you will have to list each class that you have taken, so you should get some unofficial transcripts for yourself so that you are prepared for when that time comes. I also know that I broke up the application into parts and decided about how many days of the month I would allow myself on a particular section. This is not an application that you want to take lightly people!
As for now, this is all the information that I have. Next fall I should have some great insight on the whole application and also maybe some comments about an interview or two (Ill keep my fingers crossed for those).
I just have to keep telling myself that I can do it, and you can to!
Happy almost last week of classes!

Ah, it is that time of year again! The sun is high in the sky, shooting photons into the Earth's atmosphere at an alarmingly high rate, the male birds are a hootin' and a hollerin' at the lady birds, and many of the male humans are doing about the same (although it is directed at lady humans, not birds). We are closing out the final weeks of school here at the University of Minnesota Rochester, and things sure are heating up. You would think all of the students are concerned about finals, and you are right. However, there is a good deal of concern about the presentation of our research projects in this upcoming week, especially in my case as I currently have three presentations to work on. However, these are coming along nicely and are great fun to work with. Finals will soon come and go as they always do, but the next event is the great summer. Some people are heading back to their hometowns for this summer, some are heading out to new places (one of my friends is going to Washington D.C. to work in the White House), and some are staying here with me in Rochester. I cannot advise those going to their hometowns and I cannot even hope to imagine what the White House has in store for my friend, but I can advise on summer activities in Rochester.
The summer is a lively time here, and is becoming more lively every year. This year there will be the popular and recurring Thursdays on First and Third where vendors come from all over to set up shop in the downtown area every Thursday throughout the summer. This is a wonderful opportunity to see what the community has to offer since the vendors are from every background and come from all over the state while the people attending the event are always great fun to meet and talk to. I, personally, will be spending as much time there as possible.
But wait, there's more to Thursdays on First and Third than just vendors! There are also live bands and shows playing in the evening. These can range from an amateur rock band, to a well-known acoustic band, to a performance featuring break-dancing, juggling, and drums. I only got to see a little bit of the last one, but I wish I could have seen the entire performance.
Long story short, if you're looking for something to do on a summer Thursday in downtown Rochester, you're not looking anymore.]]>
So as you might have seen in previous blogs I was talking about my capstone ideas. For those of you just tuning in, a capstone is like your junior year or senior year at UMR. It is when you take steps to do a program or take courses of interest that will help you prepare for the career you are trying to achieve.
For me, my capstone is to take courses at UMR in the fall to finish up my liberal education requirements as well as an internship in a lab and a research project with a faculty member. In the spring I will be doing an internship program in London as well as volunteering at the Ronald McDonald House.
Although I did complete all of the required paperwork and additional forms, sadly my capstone was rejected. This was pretty devastating, but once I realized the mistakes that I made, which were minor, it made sense.
As a matter of fact, I would like to think of myself as a trailblazer. Through my capstone rejection, I made up a new category that will be used during the review process "conditionally approved" which basically means that I had a small error (I apparently cannot add correctly). This will be used in the future, so it just goes to show that sometimes mistakes are a good thing.
It was some easy corrections to make, but it is a very serious issue. So I would suggest taking as much time as possible to review your capstone with everyone before you submit it the first time.
I also started my capstone proposal early. I began writing responses to the questions in a word documents in the fall semester of my junior year so that I was ready to complete the proposal. As far as the spring semester goes, it comes up really fast. I would suggest getting your ideas and beginning to answer those questions in the fall so that you don't have to spend so much time cramming in all of the writing and researching at the end.
If you have any questions or need any help with making a timeline, let me know!

Hey everyone!
The end of the year is approaching quickly. So I thought it would be good to share with you some of my favorite educational apps that I have on my iPhone.
These are also apps that you could probably get on android devices, iPads, or iPods. They come in handy when you are waiting in line for coffee, trying to cram in a few extra study minutes before that exam, or in a situation where you wish you would have brought your notes with you but forgot them.
My most used and helpful app is for OneNote. It automatically syncs with my OneNote program on my computer so it is really helpful for me because I use OneNote for basically all my classes since freshman year. I can access all of my notebooks too so it is a great app!
Here is the link to get it from the iTunes store, its completely free!
I also have an app that is called Evernote. This is a desktop application that you can sync with your device also. You can pull screenshots or sections of webpages into your Evernote on your computer and have access to them at your fingertips. This would be beneficial if you were at the grocery store and wanted to try out a new recipe that you clipped from the web.
Here is a link from the iTunes store:
Being a UMR student, you all know how much we use the Google applications. So you can get an app for Google Drive. This helps you find your Google Documents easily, I actually used mine the other day when I was buying supplies for the talent show skit that the Rochester Student Association is performing in. (By the way, that event is Tonight 7:30 pm at the Civic Center in the Auditorium, if you don't know the way there follow the balloons in the skyway!)
Here is the link to Google Drive:
Another app that I use for my personal use and also for my research group that I am involved in is Dropbox. This is an application that you can download from your computer, access on the web, and also access on your personal devices. I keep persona files separate from my research files of course, but for me it functions like an additional portable hard drive. I only keep my current semester files on there, but it automatically syncs when I make changes and goes right on the web. So you don't have to worry if your computer crashes again because that paper will be saved right on the Dropbox and your phone! I also like to use Dropbox to upload the photos that I take with my phone to my computer. Personally I think it is faster than the Photo Stream that my iCloud suggests.
The link to that app is:
An important app that I use for my classes is Quizlet. This is an online website that allows you to make notecards. You can then access those on your devices and you can sync when you make new notecards.
Here is the link to the app:
For those of you who follow my blogs, you should remember that I went to Panama last summer. For that trip I found a few medical Spanish and emergency Spanish apps that were really helpful for me. They could also be beneficial in Spanish III here at UMR because it is a course based on healthcare terminology.
One was called MediBabble:
The other was Emergency Medical Spanish Guide by Mavro:
I also used a few apps for my MCAT prep. They were BenchPrep, MCAT Question of the Day, and MCAT Smart Vocab. The last two are self-explanatory, but they are great practice and helpful to keep you on task with studying. I tried to do a few vocab a day and at least one question of the day. They do keep a record of all the previous questions, so you will never run out of practice. As for the BenchPrep, I signed up for a course through the BenchPrep website and then was able to access it from my phone and online. It was really helpful when I wanted to get through a specific topic in a day.
Here are the links :

MCAT Question of the Day-

One of the most recent apps that I added is called Frommer's. This is the brand of a book that I borrowed from the study abroad coordinator about London. Some great features that I have noticed are the currency converter, a tip calculator, time translator, guide to the city, suggested apps for travelling... and the list goes on!
Here is the link to the app (make sure to check to see that the city you are travelling to is included!):
Hope these help you as much as they help me!

The do-se-do begins here in Rochester. The semester begins to end and everyone realizes they need to figure out where they are living next year. Some students are deciding not to live in this or that house/apartment next year which puts the other roommates in a bind--Do we move, can we afford staying without them and can we find someone else, who should we ask? A series of questions run through our heads as the scrabble to live in the best place for you begins.
This will be my third year at UMR. My first year, I lived at 318. I would suggest any new incoming student to consider living here first. One really gets to develop a relationship with those in their class. During your first year at UMR, everyone has the same classes. So, just down the door is another student studying for the same organic chemistry test or if there is a paper due everyone has the paper due at the same time. It's a great environment with helpful RA's for any roommate conflicts. The amenities are wonderful and you don't have to worry about monthly bills and getting them paid on time. This is one thing I really miss. Early in the morning at 318 one can just walk downstairs in pajamas to attend class. Posters and RA's at 318 always keep you updated into what events are happening at UMR. The people that live at 318 are always first to know.
The downside is that on campus housing is expensive and at least in my case I was looking to become more independent. I found an apartment called Civic Square that has two bedrooms that worked perfect this year for my roommate and I. It has to be furnished which wasn't a problem for me with my family moving and downsizing. I looked forward to carpet, my own furniture, and a homey feel. The part one doesn't realize is how quiet it can be. My roommate and I have different schedules and work at different times. We stayed here in the summer to take CNA classes at RCTC. It was a great experience as well. The place was very often quiet though. We didn't have random visitors or students knocking on or door for help with homework or just to talk like we had often at 318. The quiet was a blessing, but also kind of lonely at times. It was really nice to get away and work on the hard projects that sophomore year provided. The quiet apartment, gave us a break from campus life. Coming into March though, we decided to pursue other options. With tons of furniture in my name, pots and pans galore, and a closets full of everything I own, I set out to find a different option for my housing for next year.
To begin looking is a little bit scary. At first I panicked thinking no one would take me. Then I realized that there were tons of people doing the same thing and trying to fill spots in their own housing situation. Everyone started asking everyone what their plans were. It is amazing to me how much is changing from 2nd to 3rd year in terms of who is living where. I began first by looking people to potentially live in the 2nd bedroom in my apartment. I was really fearful about the move with all the stuff I have. My family is really busy and will not be able to come down to help. But then I had offers to live at other apartments and other homes. A group of four of my friends have a roommate moving out of there five bedroom house. It looks like at this point I am going to go there.
Possible negative changes that I will have to face by moving into a new house include sharing a bathroom with two other girls. I also will have a lot longer walk to school and work. Over the summer I will have to help mow the lawn. In the winter, I will have to help clear the snow. There is storage space to myself, but tons that we can share. I may not be able to add my furniture into the house the way I want. There are a lot of opinions in the house that may override my own.
Bonuses include the house will not be as quiet and lonely. I will get to live with my friends and build closer friendships. It's cheaper about half the price that I pay to live in the apartment I have now! It's across the street and a block down from more of my friends. I will now have access to cable television. It will feel more homey then an apartment. It has a larger kitchen then I have now. There is a lot of communication between house members. This house in particular makes a point to hear everyone's opinion and talk through any conflicts. There is also one person that will collect and handle the bills which it won't be me anymore. I also will get an experience that I have always wanted. And besides college, when else can I live in one house with four friends?
So the adventure continues as people finalize their plans for next year. It is amazing to me how even through this process how much of a family UMR has really become for me. I have had many offers from many people to help me move. They don't care about how long or how much work it will take, they are willing to take a day off to help me get where I need to be. It isn't just a few friend, it includes a list of about 8-10 people that I know that I could possible contact to help me. Some of these people include past roommates, future roommates and good friends. Everyone has been very understanding and trying to help everyone find the best fit for them for next year. Whether it's 318, an apartment or a house, it will all work out and come fall we will be ready to learn.
This weekend I went to the Mall of America for the third time in my life. Coming from 3hours the other direction, the Mall is nearly 5 hours away from my home town, making it very difficult for me to go there as a kid.
To start this weekend, my aunt and her twin daughters came up to visit me for the whole weekend. Friday night they got up pretty late so we just ate dinner that I made, settled in and got caught up on each other's lives. The next morning we got up early and headed to the mall. It was my third time and the first time for all of them. My twin cousins are 12 so it wasn't abnormal for them not to have been there as they live 5+ hours away, but my aunt is 40, so it was cool to take her to MOA for the first time. They really had no idea how big the mall was, however they did know about Nickelodeon Universe. My aunt bought all day passes to ride rides, but we did go shopping first. When we started, we were overwhelmed and didn't know where to begin. We eventually started walking and found some neat stores. Some of our favorite stores were Garage, Flips, Pac Sun, Harley, and the Peeps Candy Store. After a lot of shopping, we headed to the rides, which were surprisingly quiet and unique. I live fairly close to Great America, so finding unique rides is hard to do. These definitely surprised me. We stayed in Nickelodeon Universe riding rides, shopping and eating until it closed when we went on the adventure to find my car which took significantly longer than expected. Who knew it would be so difficult to locate a car at a mall with parking ramps. We eventually got to my car, then home by 12:30 am, about an hour after expected.
The next day we all slept in really late (about time...) then ate breakfast. I gave my family a tour around the skyways and streets of Rochester. It is honestly a pretty unique place and has some pretty cool places, even though Rochester is basically closed on Sundays. After they left, I had to resume the typical college weekend life and clean the apartment, eat some food and avoid homework until the last possible second when I wish I hadn't. Although the weekend flew by, I had so much fun!
I have now had my dog Parker for about 3 months. After getting him I kind of had some anxiety about having a dog in college. It turns out, he has not been too much of a nuisance. He only peed and pooped in the house a couple of times! One of the times though, he pooped in his kennel. I got a text from my roommate, Evan, that said, "He s#!+ in his kennel, should I clean it up?"
I'm thinking "Yes, yes you should clean it up, how nice of you to even consider doing it."
Then he texts me again and says "I only have time to clean one thing, it's either him or the crate."
At this point I'm in a full panic. Who cleans one, but not the other? No matter which route he goes, there is still going to be poop in my bedroom. So I took off for home, hoping I could get there before he put the clean dog back in his own feces. When I got there he had given Parker a bath and said that I should watch out when I go into my room because the stink was so awful he was gagging. He also told me that he let Parker out and he wouldn't go to the bathroom so he just took him inside to give him his bath. As he was prepping the tub, Parker proceeded to poop on the floor creating even more of a mess for him to clean up.
In the meantime, I went to my room preparing for the worst. I opened the door and a waft of dog crap hit my nostrils. Now it was my turn to keep from puking. Somehow I ended up cleaning it up without any throwing up! Beyond that little episode, Parker has been a really easy dog to care for. He listens well, for the most part, and he doesn't poop inside anymore.]]>
If you are one of the students here at UMR that has a passion to help others and give back to the community, then Circle K is the club just for you! I recently found out about Circle K from a friend who told me all of the things that Circle K does. Circle K involves plenty of volunteering opportunities. Circle K meets every other week over at 318 Commons from 7 to 8 PM. Our leader for the club is the one and only Michelle Burgraff. She is an incredible leader and very motivated at getingt the club running. She is dedicated to helping students in the club get as much volunteering experience as possible.
Circle K club is also joined by the Kiwanis. They are a bunch of enthusiastic people that have the same outlook as Circle K. This outlook involves giving back to the community and lending a helping hand. The club motto is "Live to Serve, Love to Serve." This is Circle K's first year at UMR and the turnout has been amazing for a club so new to campus! There are about 70 students in the club and a good majority of them are freshman. Anyone can join the club and I guarantee it will be the best choice you ever make! I am so happy that I decided to join the club because it is a life changing, great experience of what it is like to work with others, and a lot of fun.
March 14, 2013 was a big day for Circle K because we were inducted into the Rochester Kiwanis Club. Every student in the club got a certificate and made a promise to the Kiwanis's that we will be responsible and great future leaders in the community! Not to be biased, but Circle K is the best club ever and I couldn't be any happier being in a club filled with great people sharing the same passion to help the community. If you have Facebook, head on over, take a look, and don't forget to "Like" it!
Coming to college, I expected a lot of things. I had high expectations from the movies or TV shows, making it seem like college would be living the life and having the "college experience." I would make friends and have them for life. Be best friends with my roommate and live happily ever after, be partners in crime and have a maid of honor. We could have Taco Tuesdays and study for tests until all odd hours of the night together. I would finally get away from my annoying little brother and having to walk the dog at the demands of my mom. I can stay up as late as I want and go shopping at my pleasure. However, college isn't a static place where you find one person to be best friends with, or making your schedule completely independent of others. Not everything will work out as planned, but rolling with the punches is what makes the college experience all it's put up to be. I've made a list of six things that have changed this year and how it affected me. Looking back, a lot of this could have brought me down, but finding the positive things has made me enjoy college so much more and appreciate everything that happens. After all, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
1. Moving to Rochester, MN from Waunakee, WI. This is a pretty obvious change. I gained so much education, many friends, the experience of living in a city. I learned to be independent, saw places of MN I probably would have never seen otherwise and lived in a town that had already changed my life. Although I miss my family, I really do love living here and having such a different experience every single day. The skyways are amazing, the food is different and so readily available, and everything you could possibly need (except my family) is right here. This is nothing like living back home and it's so nice to live something different. I'm not saying it is or isn't something I'll do for the rest of my life, but I'm so glad I got the chance to try it and say I did, and maybe I'll live in the city for part or the rest of my life.
2. Varying my friends. I'm the kind of person who likes to have many friends who like to do a variety of things. Sticking with one group of people may be the best for certain people, but that's just not my thing. I also like to be around positive, active people who treat others respectfully. Surrounding yourself with people like you is the best way to stay happy and motivated in my opinion, so that's what I try to do. When friendships aren't working out, don't force it. Maybe that's just me, but forcing something isn't worth the time, effort or strain. There are plenty of similar people in the world, find them and be yourself.
3. Getting a car. I've always been a fairly do as I please person, especially being as involved as I am. Having as car has allowed me to attend more volunteer events, get groceries easier/on my own and go home when I need to. I wrote a blog about all the benefits of having a car called "Having a Car at School," so check that out for more details.
4. Eating habits. Being able to choose my own food has been super nice for me, as well as made my life generally healthier. I tend to eat things like fruits and vegetables as snacks, rather than pop tarts and rice krispie bars that my mom would buy for my brother. Not that there is anything wrong with occasional junk food, but overall, people really should be eating healthier. And let's be honest, when you go to the doctor, who are you going to trust with your health: the fat doctor who clearly cannot follow their own advice/gives bad advice to begin with, or the fit doctor who knows how to properly maintain themselves? The fit one, obviously. So with that, I want to start being fit and maintaining a healthy life sooner rather than after it is too late and becomes a chore to be healthy.
5. My study habits. In high school, I was the student who showed up to class, paid attention most of the time, did my homework, but that was about the end of school and studying. There was no "studying." When it came to exams, I could work my way through enough of it to pull good grades, especially balanced out with the high homework averages. College completely changed that. Some of the things I do to study at college are completing all of the homework, going to nearly all of the help sessions, going to the necessary JustAsk hours, doing all optional review guides and practice exams, working through problems with friends for complete understanding and re-reading chapters from text books. And when I say I re-read the chapters, that means I read the chapters to begin with, which is more than I did for most classes in high school. Learning how to study in college was rough and a quick learning curve, but definitely is starting to pay off.
6. Careers. I came here determined to be a pediatric neurologist. I was going to go to med school then do 11 years of residency and spend the rest of my life helping kids with neurological disorders. Then I wondered when I could have a family in there, so I changed my path to physician's assistant in neurology. Since then, I've thought about being a surgical first assistant, clinical neurophysiology tech, nurse anesthetist and back to med school. As for now, I'm pretty settled on PA, but I know that can change, and I'm open to the opportunities I'm presented.
College isn't easy, and change is always happening, but it is so worth it in the end. I have gained so much here from friends to knowledge to self-understanding. I now know who I am so much better and I think I know more what my priorities are in life.
Hope you all had a wonderful and memorable spring break 2013! I was looking forward to this break for quite some time. I bet all of us needed a break from school. Most of us travelled out of the state or stayed in the state but still went places. For me, I had one fun and exciting spring break ever! On early Saturday morning, my family and I headed to the Twin Cities to help my uncle move into his new house. It had just renovated. Now that might not seem fun.... moving boxes and furniture, but for me, if someone needs the help I am more than happy to lend a helping hand. When my family and I got to my uncle's house, there were plenty of people there going in and out of the house already moving things into the truck! We just stepped in and made the process go a bit faster and to take a load off of the movers there. It was such a fun day especially because I had my brother, sister, and cousin there to share a laugh with. We did a lot of moving and we were so happy that the day was warm and sunny!
Sunday was the day I was looking forward to the most! We visited the 2013 Auto Show in Minneapolis! I am a huge fan of cars, especially Mercedes Benz, BMW's, Audi's, and the one and only Volkswagen. After a long previous day of moving boxes and furniture, it was a day to relax and not move heavy things. I went to this event with my family and my two baby cousins. We saw many amazing cars like the ones pictured below. When we got tired of looking at cars, we all headed over to Mall of America to do some retail therapy. My spring break was all about catching up on sleep. Best spring break ever!

In yet another example of how the University of Minnesota Rochester is different from any other campus (and there are many examples around), the most competitive sport on campus is Ballroom Dancing. Allow me to re-iterate, the college that I go to has only one sport where students compete against others outside of our University; Ballroom Dancing. While students at other universities are shelling out too much money to go cheer on their division level football, soccer, hockey, or other team, the University of Minnesota Rochester students are sauntering into a cozy ballroom with plush seats to cheer on their friends with countless other friends and fans. I am fortunate enough to be one of the competitors on our team, I have been this fortunate for two years now. I must admit that I enjoy competitive ballroom dancing far more than the football, soccer, hockey, and track that I used to play and watch in high school.
In this past month we competed in the annual competition, and we dressed to impress. We donned our flowing gowns, slinky dresses, and gentlemanly tuxedos and paraded onto the dance floor, devoted to the idea of showing our best effort. Let me tell you, we exceeded that effort in almost every dance (I had to learn one of my dances 5 minutes prior to competing). We had couples placing in almost every criteria and even those who did not place did very well. On top of it all, we looked magnificent and had a wonderful time. I had more fun those two days of competition than I had at any of my other sports competitions throughout my entire life. I am a very firm supporter of the UMR Ballroom Team and look forward to the incoming freshmen next year!]]>
"You've never truly lived until you have done something for someone who can never repay you." This is a quote that describes my spring break perfectly. Instead of going to lie on a beach or sit at home, I choose to do something with my break; I choose to go on the Students Today Leaders Forever trip. STLF is an organization that was thought up by some UMTC students a few years ago. It is a bus trip that travels through cities volunteering and meets other STLF tours in the destination city. This year the UMR bus traveled through Chicago, IL, Detroit, MI, Canton, OH, Beckley, WV, Knoxville, TN, making our way to Atlanta, GA. We left Friday afternoon making our way to Chicago. There were 38 of us on the bus, not knowing each other very well, but ready to go on the adventure together.
In Chicago we slept in a YMCA gym that had lights that didn't shut off. That morning we got up and went to a nature reserve and cleared invasive species. After a few hours of cutting and chopping we got back on the bus to make our way to Detroit. As we traveled through the city you could see that it was a ghost town. Detroit was the most eye opening city we traveled to. We stayed in a church that served us Corn Beef for dinner and breakfast the next morning. We volunteered at a veteran's homeless shelter. That was an amazing experience. Some of us served breakfast and lunch while the rest of us made bags of toiletries and organized some storage areas. One of the men there came up to us and thanked us for going to school and going into the medical field. He told us to keep the nation healthy and keep up our good work. They sent us on our way to Canton, OH with snack bags that had hand written thank you notes.
In Canton we got to explore down town which had a really cool art district and an adorable coffee shop that we went to. That night we stayed at another YMCA that had lights that turn off! There, we prepared for our service activity, which was teaching 2nd and 5th graders Junior Achievement. Junior Achievement is about businesses and how they work so being health sciences majors this was a little challenging. When we got there all of the kids were happy to see us and learn about the things we were teaching. I taught a 2nd grade class and it was so fun. I'm glad it was only two hours though! Gained a lot of respect for elementary school teachers! After that we got back on the bus to travel to Beckley, WV! Beckley was the first city we went through that had weather above 40 degrees. It was like summer! We stayed in another church that night. The next morning we did service at a hospice care center doing various tasks. Some worked around the grounds and I worked on a mapping project, mapping the placement of memorial stones. They fed us lunch of Chick-fil-A, macaroni and cheese, and salad. I had never had Chick-fil-A before and it was so good! Then we set off for Knoxville!
In Knoxville we got to explore the city and eat dinner. A big group of us ate at Jig and Reel which was a Scottish Pub. It was pretty good! Then went to our housing cite which was a huge church. There was a band practicing there when we got there and they played for us. Then we played Sardines, like reverse hide and seek, in the giant, 4 story church. That morning we were volunteering with Keep America Beautiful cleaning up garbage around the city. In one little area we cleared out 15 bags of garbage! Then we filled on the bus to make our way to Atlanta, GA! In Atlanta we got to stay in hotel which was really nice after sleeping on the ground for a week. The first night we all went to a Waffle House; one of my favorite places ever. The next morning, all 160 of us from the 4 buses went to a park to help there. We all did different jobs, planting trees, building a fence, clearing a pathway, or cutting out invasive species. My friend Erica and I worked on clearing a path to an area that would be used by the local boy scouts. When we were finished we all ate lunch together. That night we had our celebration with the other 3 buses we met in Atlanta. We took the next two days to travel back to Rochester, staying in St. Louis on the way back.
Overall, STLF was the greatest experience I have ever had. I have done a lot of volunteering in my day but this has been the best opportunity, by far! This trip helped to open my eyes to many new things and I made 37 new friends out of it! I would totally recommend this trip to anyone that loves to volunteer and wants a little bit of adventure in their spring break! Yeahhhhh buddy!!!

Hi!
So as you already know from my previous blog I spent a day over spring break making cookies with my grandma to use for a blog. But what blog is that? Well I can finally reveal the big secret, one of the cookie choices was healthy and the other was a recipe taken from the bag of chocolate chips, a well known Hershey's brand recipe.
I set up these two types of cookies in the Admissions Office on Monday March 25th and had everyone that walked through sample one of each cookie and then rank their favorite based on taste. But before I announce the results of the test, lets back up..
So I first found some healthy chocolate chip cookie recipes on Pinterest while browsing one day and thought to myself, that I love cookies and it would be great if I would eat a healthier version so that I wouldn't feel so guilty. So I then proposed the question, do they taste different?
In order to answer this question I knew that I would need more than just my opinion, so I decided to make it a test.
The healthy recipe was referred to as choice A throughout the testing and the recipe is located here:. Rather than oats I used oat flour, so that it had a smooth texture, and as you can see they didn't look very different after they were baked (which was good because I didn't want people judging based on the ingredients).
The Hershey's brand of cookies is located on the back of the bag but also here:.
Here is a comparison of the two types of dough, you can definitely tell why one is more yellow (it's a whole extra stick of butter than the first recipe).
Then once the cookies were made we froze them to keep them fresh until I would come back to school to have the testing.
Then I set them up in the admissions office with some simple instructions:
When it was all said and done, the two choices came out dead even. So in conclusion, the healthy cookies do not taste any different than the normally prepared ones, but they are less calories and less content of ingredients.
Here is a comparison:
Personally I liked the healthier cookies, but that was based on consistency and texture of the cookie as well as the taste. I also like the fact that I would be able to eat about two and not feel terrible about myself!
Have any other questions that you would be dying to have tested? Let me know! I'm always up for baking ideas!

The University of Minnesota has been awarded an $8.6 million contract to help speed the development of novel stem cell- and immune cell-based therapies from the laboratory to clinical trials through the Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) program.
The award, from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, was given to five academic centers, including centers at the University of Minnesota, Baylor College of Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These sites will serve as national resources for the development of new treatments for patients with various heart, lung, and blood diseases.
The University of Minnesota team will continue to work on establishing national best practices for the development of cellular therapies. Investigators here have been at the forefront of research on umbilical cord blood and the development of regulatory T cells and natural killer cell therapies to enhance the effectiveness of blood and marrow transplants and reduce their complications.
“Few institutions in the U.S. have the combined expertise and resources in one place to take an idea from the research bench to the patient bedside as we have at the Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics Facility,” says principal investigator John E. Wagner, M.D., who together with David McKenna, M.D., and Jeffrey Miller, M.D., will lead the University program.
The PACT award is the second fiveyear contract Wagner has received at the University to help accelerate work on cellular therapies. The University’s first contract, awarded in 2003, fundamentally transformed the pace of new cell-based therapies.

Unless you are a not for profit, your goal as a business owner is to make profit. There are a number of directions you can take to get there and social media marketing is one of them. But as a business owner, are you diving into social media expecting it to instantly become a revenue source? If so, read on and I will share with you how you should be approaching social media first and foremost as a way to build relationships with your audience(s).
Nothing Beats Having a Great Community!
When it comes to search and social media marketing, your community should be the center of your focus. Your community can act as brand advocates and ultimately help increase your brand awareness. Without that community, it is very difficult to devise a strong, working social media marketing campaign. Come up with a plan and create steps that will help you reach your goal. In this case, your goal is to get a community.
How do you Get a Great Community?
Building a great community takes time, dedication and patience. Manual outreach, marketing (paid and/or organic), content sharing, networking (face to face helps) and simply seeking out individuals with similar interests are just a few of the many community building actions you should implement. Building a great community isn’t something that happens overnight so if you aren’t committed to the long-haul, you are better off working with a marketing agency to alleviate some of the work.
Once you Have the Community, Engage With Them
After setting your community based social media goals and reaching them, by no means is this quitting time. You worked hard to get where you are at so after a quick pat on the back, it is time to start engaging with your community. Engage with your community on individual and group levels and be personable. Too many times, when building social media communities, the human factor is overlooked. Your audience wants to interact with humans and they will easily spot automated responses and other automatically generated communications. Be human!
Use Your Community to Promote Your Brand
Whether it’s giving away something for free or holding an interactive contest for your audience to participate in, generate some sort of buzz around your product or service. At a recent social media conference I attended in Buffalo, NY, Ramon DeLeon of Dominos Pizza shared with the audience that while he cannot make profit selling pizzas for a dollar (which he does) he will make profit with the buzz it generates socially. Word of mouth marketing is still the best form of marketing and when you treat your social audiences right, they will share their positive experiences. No matter what type of business you operate, techniques such as Ramon’s can be easily applied. Treat your customers and community so well with these freebies and contests that they feel guilty not using your brand. This is what a strong community is and why you took the time to build it.
What’s Next?
Social media marketing and everything that goes into it will never come to rest. It will take ongoing efforts, maintenance, listening and reacting to keep you moving full steam ahead. After building a strong social community and engaging with them to the point where it gets them talking to their social circles, you can more easily measure ROI and put a value on each of your followers, likes, etc. Use social media as a tool to create buzz, share great content and as a way to spark that all so mighty word of mouth marketing.
So in conclusion, don’t think of social media as a means of direct revenue. Build a strong community, engage with them, use them as brand advocates and the revenue will follow if you are doing things correctly. Start by figuring out the lifetime value of a customer, create a social media goal and then steps that are going to get you to your end goal.
I encourage you to share your thoughts and questions in the comments section below!

Wow! Check out this stunning embroidered and patchworked upholstery from Fun Makes Good. I have done some upholstery myself, and have a good appreciation for the work it takes! I had never thought of making my own textiles, but will add it to my To Do list. The swallow pouf is also fantastic. (Via Red Jet Whistle.)

Steps
Step #1:Next
- First, you will need a few things:
- 1. A gearmotor capable of lifting something about the weight of an AA battery to half the distance you want the blade to fall (explained in more detail later).
- 2. One or two wall power supplies (or the equivalent in batteries) which combined produce the maximum voltage your gearmotor can take. Using two supplies will give you a better effect but a single one will work if it produces sufficient voltage.
- 3. An adapter to fit your motor.
- 4. A small microswitch (N.O./N.C.) that will go alongside your motor. Mine had this built in.
- 5. A hunk of cardboard the size you want the guillotine's blade to be.
- 6. Aluminum foil.
- 7. A dowel rod. Its length should be half the distance you want the blade to move.
Step #2:Next
- 8. (optional) A metal rod a little over double the length of the dowel.
- 9. Fishing line.
- 10. Various pieces of mounting hardware.
Step #3:Next
-.
Step #4:Next
-.
Step #5:Next
-.
Step #6:
- The last steps are to make a blade out of cardboard and aluminum foil (do NOT use sheet metal, as it may actually decapitate someone!).
- Then poke a hole in the weight center of the top (where it balances), put the fishing line through, and tie a knot so it doesn't back out. Do not tie it directly to the blade, or the fishing line will not spin freely, and it will tangle.
- Add your hook or suction cup a little over twice the length of the spinning arm above the ground.
- Run the line from the blade through the hook. Mount the motor where you want it, and turn the motor so the arm faces directly away from the hook.
- Extend the line from the blade so that the blade is a few inches below the hook, then run it to the arm and either tie it off, glue it, or tape it. This should leave you with the blade all the way up, and the arm at its farthest.
- Remove the arm from the motor and apply power. Wait for it to finish its brief high-speed cycle, and stop it. Then replace the arm so that the blade is all the way in the down position.
- If nothing catches on the line, then apply power and you should have a working guillotine.

Patriots defensive end Markell Carter draws inspiration from sister's battle with lupus
FOXBOROUGH – Sometimes Markell Carter feels like he’s playing for two.
Whenever he feels like he can’t do another bench press or run another sprint during practice, he pictures his sister, Keyarrie Hudson, and it gives him the strength to push on.
“She’s really strong, a lot stronger than me,” the Patriots’ second-year defensive end said. “Lupus probably would have been the end of me. For her, it was just a new chapter in her life. She took it in full force.”
The 21-year-old Hudson also has her brother to help absorb some of the blow in her battle with lupus, an autoimmune disease that affects the skin, joints, kidneys, brain and other organs.
Carter is in the process of moving his sister from Oklahoma to his home in the Boston area so she has better access to specialists who can help her deal with her condition, but he feels like the biggest beneficiary of the arrangement since his best friend and main source of inspiration will be back under his roof.
“It’s always been me and my little sister since I was (young),” Carter said. “Just to see her go through those struggles, see how she had a smile on her face even though I knew it was hurting her. Just how she stayed in her faith, and how she didn’t lose herself.
“A lot of people would have been depressed and lost who they were, but she never lost that. She was that same girl as she was before and after.”
And right now, any boost Carter can get can only help him.
A practice squad player last season, the 22-year-old is looking to carve out a role on the 53-man roster and earn some playing time.
He added 10 pounds of muscle to his frame over the offseason, putting him at 275 pounds, up from the 250 he played at as a senior at Central Arkansas, and took part in rookie camp over the weekend to give himself a leg up on the competition.
“Whenever coach gives you the opportunity to learn more, you take it,” Carter said. “Just having these extra two days to be in the meeting room, to be back on the field, doing drills, it’s going to give me a head start.”
“(During the lockout) I was sitting on my couch. I’d work out in the morning two hours and then after that have the whole day to myself. Now I’m more organized, I’m more of a professional.”
Despite not using him last season, something Carter says he feels not bitterness about, the Patriots believe that he can be a valuable member of the team, and expressed that during the offseason by doubling his salary from $150,000 to $306,000.
With defensive linemen Andre Carter and Mark Anderson both off of the roster, he may have a shot to prove that he was worth the bump salary at some point this season.
“You’ve got a lot of young fresh legs running around out there. You’ve got a lot of eagerness out there. We all want to prove ourselves,” Carter said. “Us being so young, we haven’t established ourselves in this league.”
If he manages to do that, it would certainly make his sister proud.

The next system will be more about cold air than winter precipitation. Light rain or snow is again possible Sunday night into Monday, but it will be followed by very cold temperatures for the rest of next week. Precipitation amounts will be light if any with this system. Finally, one mid-range model is showing the possibility of a significant winter storm for the middle of next week. Another, perhaps more reliable, model is not showing that system as of this afternoon. We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated!

Some people still believe that, to be happy, we need to accumulate things. Shopping malls have become the destination of choice for human entertainment, in turn making our regions economically dependent on department stores.
Have you ever wondered where so
much of what we buy, mostly needlessly, comes from and goes? The system of production and consumption on our planet begins with extraction. You get the necessary natural resources (minerals, water, wood, etc.) from all over the world taken to manufacturing centres. There they are combined with synthetic products, and energy is invested to produce anything from clothing to appliances. So far, so clear.
Yet there are two basic problems with this system. First, there are not enough natural resources in the world to meet the current demand of Western consumption. The USA, with only 5 per cent of the global population, uses about 30 per cent of the world’s resources. Clearly, if other countries follow these rates of consumption – and there are several that threaten to do so including India and China – our resources will run out much sooner than we think.
Second, the world’s largest corporations have amassed so much power that they’re increasingly difficult to regulate. According to the consultancy Global Trends, of the world’s 150 largest economies only 41 per cent are countries; the rest are corporations.
There are various drawbacks to this situation, from the terrible working conditions for employees in developing countries, to the destruction of valuable natural resources without compensation. All this to produce shoes, watches and tablets as quickly and cheaply as possible to satisfy the demand of global consumers.
Although consumption trends are high
in many countries (Germany leads in Europe, while the growth in some Persian Gulf countries is astounding), the USA has topped the list since the times of Victor Lebow. This analyst theorized that for the large US economy to maintain its robustness, it would need to make consumption a permanent part of the US lifestyle.
It is seriously difficult to understand prices in US malls. How can a buyer know how much was earned by the Chinese boy who assembled the product by hand? If he was offered social security and health benefits? How much did the fuel cost to bring it from China to Rotterdam to Florida? If it is an electronic device, where did the Coltan come from? And how much was paid to farmers who extracted it? If this mineral – vital for cell phones and games consoles – came from D.R. Congo, did it come stained with blood?
We do not have sufficient space to address the last link in this consumer system: the inevitably gigantic quantities of waste generated. But the message is clear, responsible citizenship requires us, at the very least, to ask ourselves again and again if we really need that new item that we are about to buy.
Although modern advertising may suggest the opposite, and those who call us ‘ecocentric’ are everywhere, it is worth pursuing sustainable lifestyles. Ultimately, parks and fellow humans are worth more than shopping malls and corporations. Because our quality of life doesn’t depend on our level of consumption!

"We're encouraged she is getting help through the Lord. That's the first step," the Muskegon woman said after watching a judge sentence Laurie Swank to a lengthy prison term.
Ottawa County Circuit Judge Ed Post ordered Swank, 49, to an agreed-upon term of 10 to 20 years in prison Monday for the 1979 murder of 22-year-old Hope College student Janet Chandler.
Her second-degree murder sentence comes three weeks before Post is to sentence four others -- all former Wackenhut security guards who knew Chandler through her night clerk job at the Blue Mill Inn -- whom Swank helped convict earlier this month through trial testimony.
Arthur "Carl" Paiva of Muskegon, James "Bubba" Nelson, Anthony Williams and Freddie Parker face mandatory life prison terms when sentenced Dec. 10 for felony murder.
Swank, who calmly unfolded a creased paper on which she penned her thoughts, told Chandler's family she wanted to take responsibility for her part in the murder.
"Age, ignorance, coveting and jealousy -- there are no excuses," she said, describing how she has lived in a "self-imposed mental prison that has affected every aspect of my life" since 1979.
"I am not and have not been the same person since Janet died," she said.
Swank, still handcuffed as she clutched the paper, offered an apology Monday.
"I present myself, meekly and humbly, full of God's grace, and ask for forgiveness," she said.
In 1979, Swank was Chandler's boss at the Blue Mill Inn as well as her roommate at a house on Holland's north side. Jealous of Chandler's popularity with Wackenhut guards staying at the inn and patrolling a Chemetron Corp. strike, Swank helped instigate a plan to "teach her a lesson" at a party where she would be "(raped) to death."
The guards hatched a plan to lure Chandler away from her job under the guise of a surprise party.
At the party, she was raped, beaten and ultimately strangled to death with a belt while her arms and legs were bound, and her eyes and mouth taped.
Her body was dumped in a snowbank in the I-196 median.
Former Wackenhut guard Robert Lynch, who admitted holding the belt when Chandler died, was sentenced to a minimum 25 years in prison in February after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.
On Monday, Glenna Chandler asked Post to give Swank the most prison time allowable.
"Laurie has chosen her destiny where she let hate and jealousy rule her," she said.
Chandler's father, Jim, said Monday's sentence brought another measure of justice to his family for their daughter's killing 28 years ago.
"(Justice) will never be served, but the whole thing is coming to closure," he said. "It's encouraging to hear Laurie say she is taking responsibility for what she did and recognizes there has to be a penalty to it."
Outside the courtroom, Swank's sister warmly greeted the Chandlers. Some of Swank's family were present for the sentencing, but they declined to comment.
Glenna Chandler said she cannot imagine the shock experienced by Swank's family and the other suspects' families upon learning the dark secret that had been kept for so many years.

While on the internets today I found that Mr. Level-up himself, N'Gai Croal, had finally updated his blog and tackled an issue that has been setting the game blogs ablaze: (note: I refuse to use the word blogosphere it is the most idiotic sounding word ever created) the issue of Mirror's Edge and innovation versus execution in video games.
Croal goes on to say.
I finished the game last night and since I got close to the end this past weekend I have been trying to figure out how I am going to score it. It is hard to dislike it because when the game does things right, it REALLY does them right, but the flaws cannot be ignored.
As someone who appreciates when a game designer does something different I want to laud this game as much as I can. On the other side of the coin, as a critic there is no way I can give Mirror's Edge a perfect score because it is far from perfect.
I'm glad that I found this post, it really helped me in my decision. Full review later this week.
The rest of N'Gai's post and something completely different after the break.
The Idea: Game reviewers and game players get so hung up on minutiae-i.e. game controls and combat systems-that too often, they miss what's important and innovative about games. This in turn creates a culture where gamers are searching for aspects of a game to dislike. Instead, what's needed are more critics and gamers who champion particular developers and games.
The Thinkers: Leigh Alexander, Ben Fritz, Keith Stuart
The Sources: Sexy Videogameland, The Cut Scene, Games BlogAdvertisement
The Quotes:.
--Leigh Alexander, Sexy Videogameland
[I]n the case of games that are different in some way (like a new IP, or a sequel from a new developer as in the case of "Silent Hill: Homecoming"), a lot of videogame critics obsess about the small stuff because they don't like the big picture...?
--Ben Fritz, The Cut Scene
[I]f. For
example, no-one complains that, say, Pan's Labyrinth or Eraser Head
lack the formal, easily recognisable narrative structure of a
conventional movie. Their aspirations exempt them from that
requirement. So should we really be marking Mirror's Edge down for
control issues--a game that aspires to re-interpret the very interface
between player, screen and character? Yes, I know, it's a clumsy
comparison, but the underlying point is--should reviewers just accept
that sometimes incredibly new experiences will lack some of the formal
substance we expect from traditional games? That's what innovation is,
it's leaping out into the unknown.
--Keith Stuart, Games Blog
The Reaction:.
From
where we sit, the core mechanics of Mirror's Edge--the locomotion, or
movement, of the main character--are exceedingly well implemented. The same is true for the twinning of the player and the camera. The shooting mechanics,
however, are shockingly mediocre for a studio whose history and
expertise lie in first-person shooters. As for the hand-to-hand combat,
it's certainly well-animated and pleasing to the eye. Yet it's also
both perfunctory and unforgiving, which means that it's somewhat
satisfying when you get it right and thoroughly irritating when you get
it wrong.
Stuart and Alexander would have us believe that the
fault lies with reviewers and gamers who have disparaged any of the
game's mechanics--movement, shooting or hand-to-hand combat--while
being insufficiently laudatory of the breathtaking way Mirror's Edge
simulates the experience of le parkour. They're wrong and, if we can
turn back a phrase from Fritz, they're wrong in a way that misses the
big picture. Because while the locomotion in Mirror's Edge is
praiseworthy and innovative, the game it's wrapped it not only fails to
amplify and focus said innovation, the game by and large works against
it.
What do we mean by this? Mirror.
Imagine if after crashing in a Burnout
Paradise race, the developers started you over at a standstill rather
than already in motion, and you'll have a sense of how dissatisfying
failure feels in Mirror's Edge. Stuart, for his part, says that there's
just a "smattering of trial-and-error moments," which we'll graciously
chalk up to the superiority of his gaming skills over our own. Still,
the effect of this marrying classic try, die and retry failure states to
a trickier-than-usual platformer is to create an experience that
continuously alternates between elation and frustration, which steadily
erodes the sensation that DICE comes so tantalizingly close to imparting.
This
is why the most satisfying portion by far of Mirror's Edge is the Time
Trials. In this mode, you not only expect trial-and-error, you embrace
it, because you're trying to improve your time. And by taking
manageable portions of each level and isolating them to serve as Time
Trials, you get to know each mini-level well enough that you can
successfully maintain the unbroken chain of continuous motion that is
the best thing about Mirror's Edge. Even within an individual run,
there's still exploration, but it's highly focused on looking for an
aspect of the environment that you hadn't seen previously, an alternate
route that you'd missed, all in hopes of reducing the time that it
takes to get from beginning to end. Forget Madden NFL or NBA 2K: this
is the first game that we genuinely makes us feel like an athlete when
we play it. That's when it's firing on all cylinders, however, and more
often than it should, the Mirror's Edge story mode you feels like
you're shooting blanks.
A number of reviewers have likened
Mirror's Edge to Portal. It's an apt comparison: both are
first-person games that radically innovate on how players can traverse
from Point A to Point B; both games contain movement, platforming,
exploration and combat challenges. Yet the differences between the two are ultimately more
instructive than their similarities. Portal, at its core, is about
solving environmental puzzles in order to get somewhere. Mirror's Edge, by contrast,
is about solving environmental puzzles at top speed in order to get
somewhere as quickly as possible. (Yes, there are a number of
momentum-based obstacles in Portal, but the game is nowhere nearly as
dependent on continuous movement for its pleasures as is Mirror's
Edge.) The paradox is that while most story-based games rely on forward
progression (shuttling you from new environment to new environment)
Mirror's Edge is at its most alive in its circular progression (when
you replay an environment that you're already familiar with), something
which, on your first playthrough, only happens after you fail. That's
not an easy tension to resolve, and it hasn't been resolved.
The tragedy
here is that in the development time allotted, neither DICE nor its
masters at Electronic Arts HQ were able to do what Valve did a year
ago: figure out how to take the essence of Mirror's Edge and turn it
into a game that could be sold for $60. Sure, Valve placed Portal in
the tender, nurturing embrace of Half-Life Episode 2: The Orange Box, but it also
married the innovative portal gun gameplay mechanics to a narrative
structure, enemy placement and level designs that connected its 19
discrete puzzle sequences in a way that felt the whole felt greater
than the sum of its parts. Mirror's Edge does not, and that's what is being
reflected in its reviews. As Penny Arcade's Tycho put it,
"The main problem is that I love what they've done with the art and
with the style of play, but when they start hounding me with these
snipers and S.W.A.T. motherf---ers it quickly becomes a game I don't
want. I guess the idea is to make it more exciting, but I was already
having fun."
This is, of course, merely one blog's opinion. But.
One more
point. In response the IGN UK review of Mirror's Edge which states "The
ideas are there for a very cool experience, and I truly hope that a
sequel is spawned, but this first attempt falls just a bit short," the
Guardian's Stuart replies:. I felt the same about Killer 7 and Shenmue and the mobile game, Nom - flawed every one of them, but I don't begrudge the creators a single second of the time I spent toiling with imperfections.
Similarly, in a Sexy Videogameland post that went live after the one we cited above, Alexander writes:
.
While taking issue with Stuart's claim that Mirror's Edge is a masterpiece, Variety's Fritz, in a post that went live as we were penning this screed, goes even further in lambasting the IGN reviewer for even bringing up the prospect that a sequel could solve what ails Mirror's Edge. He states:
What I think we both dislike is the cowardly critic, the one who focuses on the details and refuses to engage with the big picture ideas of the game....On the one hand, it's kind of a dismal acceptance of reality--we all know there probably will be a sequel and EA/Dice probably will address specific issues. But that's hardly the most interesting thing about "Mirror's Edge," love it or hate it. This game made some very high level choices and those are what reviewers should be engaging.
First, Fritz's complaint doesn't quite square with the review, whichThe Verdict: Red light. Reviewers aren't perfect, but attempting to police the discourse by insisting on the primacy of innovation over execution is not the answer.
tackles a big picture idea when the reviewer states that there's a
conflict between the openness of the player's abilities and the
sectioned off nature of the world. (You can read the review for
yourself here.) Second, we hate to drag out our old chestnut of a quote,
but we'll do it yet again nonetheless: We see games with our hands. In
other words, not only do mechanics matter (why else would there be a
minor civil war between those who think the floaty physics-based
platforming in LittleBigPlanet is A-OK and those who believe that it
renders the game unplayable?) but mechanics are also improvable, both
between franchises (the cover system innovated in Kill.Switch but
significantly improved in Gears of War) and within the same series (the
cover system as built for the original Gears of War and as subsequently
enhanced for Gears of War 2). To pretend otherwise is to miss a
fundamental aspect of what games are and how sequels, downloadable
content and expansion packs can function in this medium. To let the
tastes of less knowledgeable gamers dictate the dialogue among those
who are more fluent in this burgeoning critical language is to neuter
the conversation. Let's avoid doing either.
And now for something completely different

Crooks Cured by Surgeons Knife (Jul, 1930)
This is pretty terrifying, though I suppose it is just a much cruder form of how we use psychiatric drugs today.
A few things I noticed:
1. obviously being gay is a disorder.
2. they didn’t say if the prisoners were actually given any choice about their operations.
3. what did they do to the kids?
4. This quote
“It points also to the more illuminating truth that if the grandparents, or even the parents, of these men had been given proper medical and surgical treatment for their own glandular abnormalities, their children and their grandchildren would not have offended society…”
sounds like Lamarckism. Though according to Wikipedia that theory seems to be making a comeback.
5. Apparently you can tell a criminal by their face. From the pictures in the article that seems to mean “Foreign Looking”.
Crooks Cured by Surgeons Knife
Here for the first time is the amazing story of how criminals in San Quentin prison, California, are made honest by giving them healthy glands.
By H. H. DUNN
THE surgeon’s knife and the laboratory test tube have entered the campaign against crime. Experimental researches, carried on over a number of years and beginning to show results in control and reform institutions this summer, indicate that criminal tendencies may be eradicated, development of the criminal averted, and the established criminal restored to normal by medical and surgical treatment.
Most of the work which has resulted in this astounding discovery has been done in schools for “backward,” or “wayward, children in San Francisco, and among the inmates of San Quentin prison in California. Looking into the causes of criminal behavior, Dr. Ralph A. Reynolds, of San Francisco, has opened a door which apparently leads not only to the prevention of crime, but to the reformation of the adult criminal. Confirmation of the value of the method of treatment of criminal tendency by surgery and medicine awaits the test of time, but in the five years so far devoted to this work results have been achieved which indicate that the surgeon may take the place of the policeman, the physician that of the judge, and that civilization will prevent rather than punish crime.
In the course of these experiments, it was found that a very high percentage of the inmates of the prison were suffering from some abnormal condition of the endocrine or “internally secreting” glands, which empty directly into the blood stream. It was learned that perpetrators of crimes of violence showed disturbance of the thyroid, the twin gland in the front of the neck which regulates growth, while forgers and similar criminals against property were found to have abnormal conditions in the pituitary. This is a pear-shaped body about the size of a bean, lying at the base of the brain. Perverts and degenerates hid certain derangements of the sexual glands under apparently normal exteriors.
Working with Dr. L. L. Stanley, San Quentin prison physician, Doctor Reynolds found that beneficial results were obtained, both in physical condition and mental outlook, when the glandular derangements of these prisoners were corrected. Approximately sixty were so treated by operation and by administration of gland extracts. Not one failed to respond to the treatment.
THESE results with adults in the penitentiary led to two conclusions, the most important that have been made in the scientific study of crime: First, that the so-called “criminal instinct” may be removed from the minds of men, and women, by the study and treatment of the endocrine-gland systems, in childhood or later.
Second, that potential criminality may be eliminated by the treatment of these glands in youth, whenever and wherever children are found to be suffering from such abnormal conditions.
In other words, it now seems not only possible, but highly probable, that malsecretion (that is, a secretion which is too large or too small, or chemically unbalanced) of some gland is responsible for the greater part of the crime in the world.
“We are beginning to accept the fact that the criminal is not essentially ‘bad’,” said Dr. Reynolds, “but that he merely is a person who shows a departure from what society has established as the ‘normal.’ There is a growing belief among scientists that, in dealing with criminals, too much attention is paid to the mind and the emotions, and too little to the sources from, which the mind and the emotions arise, and by which they are controlled.
“On the reasonable assumption that these sources exist in the functions of the body itself, and more specifically in the chemical functions of the body, the next logical step is to find the mechanism which controls the body’s chemical activities.
“Evidence is that this mechanism exists in the endocrine glands—the glands of internal secretion, also known as the ‘ductless’ glands, because their cells secrete directly into little blood vessels in the glands, without the aid of ducts. In connection with this reasoning, it appears quite obvious than any unbalanced condition of the chemistry of the body will lead to various and varying forms of unbalance in the mental and emotional outlook, and in the conduct (i. e., behavior) of the person involved.
THE work at San Quentin, of which more later, leads logically to a study of the field from which all criminals are drawn—our children. It would be tremendously more advantageous to society to prevent the development of the criminal, than to reform him after he is developed. Aside from the saving to humanity, the economic value to civilization of the salvaging of young lives, and the conversion of young minds to useful occupations, cannot be estimated.
“My work has taken me into the medical direction if two institutions, involving about 200 children. In virtually every ‘backward’ or ‘wayward’ child, boy or girl, I have been able to see a physical departure from normal. In many that as yet are neither backward nor wayward, I see evidence of the future development of abnormal conditions in the gland system. There is the child of low, often moronic, mind, who can do good work with his hands, but not with his brain. He is mistrained, and, because his mind does not respond to the training given him, he is called a ‘dumb-bell’ or worse. He goes out into the world unprepared to earn what the world calls an ‘honest living.’ He is drawn into a ‘gang.’ He is involved in a hold-up, or a gang-fight. The law gets him, and he— with an antisocial inclination in his subnormal mind—becomes a criminal.
“Such a child should be discovered; his ancestry traced; his physical and mental history recorded; the cause of his mental condition found. He may not be—in fact, he often is not—an obvious ‘gland case,’ but in many, many instances he will be found possessed of an abnormal thyroid or pituitary gland, and back of him will lie a history of ancestors similarly affected.
“Now, many children who show visible endocrine disturbances have pleasant types of minds, never brilliant, often below normal; but usually best described as ‘fat and good-natured.’ Their obesity or extreme fatness can be reduced by the correction of their glandular disturbances, and with such reduction comes an increase in industry and ambition. The moronic mind cannot be improved, but it can be given a sound body, and it can be given the training for work with the hands which will enable its possessor to win and maintain an honest place in society.
“What we must learn about children is why one becomes a criminal and another does not. Then we must treat the subnormal child—by medicine or by surgery—to restore the chemical balance of the body. This done, we must prepare him, or her, to earn an adequate living, so that the economic incentive to crime—as well as the mental receptivity to criminal ideas— may be removed. By so doing, we shall prevent crime. Indeed, we are so preventing it, in the schools mentioned.
“It seems to me essential, as the first step in this program, that orphanages and other schools containing numbers of children whose heredity and early environment may have been unsatisfactory should segregate the problem-children for study and treatment. Certainly, children so cared for could not be harmed, while the opportunity for their improvement is tremendous.
“THERE can be no question that in the majority of instances, malsecretion of some one or more of the endocrine glands is responsible for the commission of crime. To return to the experimental work at San Quentin prison, we have traced certain criminal activities directly to certain glands.
“The treatment of these glands has resulted, in many instances, in marked mental and physical improvement of the criminal, and, moreover, in what bears every evidence of being the elimination of the tendency to commit crime.
“THE principle involved is the restoration of normal mentality through establishment of chemical stability in the body by the treatment of the gland, or glands, involved.
“Some time ago, with the cooperation of Doctor Stanley, I undertook to carry through to conclusion a series of studies and treatments of prisoners showing gland disorders. Among these were men with enlargement of the thyroid gland, the very fat, the very thin, the very tall, the very short, those having abnormal hair distribution and growth, and some with subnormal sex glands.
“The thyroid group was divided into three classes: “First, those having an excessive growth of the normal cells of the thyroid gland, resulting in a highly active, ‘nervous,’ and emotionally unstable mentality. This condition is known as ‘hyper plasia,’ or overgrowth.
“The second class consisted of those having tumorous or lumpy growths of foreign tissue within the thyroid gland. This growth secretes a poisonous substance into the blood stream, resulting in great excitability, emotional instability, increased bodily activity, and, frequently, periods of depression. This condition is known as ‘adenoma.’ ” In the third group were gathered those with ‘colloid goiter;’ that is, an abnormal growth of the thyroid gland, caused by a deposit of supposedly inert material in the gland tissue. As a rule, this condition does not present obvious external symptoms, but it does produce a tendency to obesity.
“When we referred to the records of the crimes committed by these men, we found that in approximately seventy percent of the cases those in classifications one and two had committed Crimes of violence; that is, murder, assault with intent to kill, manslaughter, or manslaughter from reckless driving.
“EVEN more important than this, we learned that many of these men had records of similar, though lesser, crimes running back to boyhood years. One man showed tendencies to this sort of crime at the age of eight. Had he been given the proper medical and surgical care when a child, his life could have been turned to usefulness, and society would have been saved the labor and expense of protecting itself from his criminal tendency.
Records of these three groups of prisoners in general showed that each suffers from an abnormal stimulation of some sort. It appears to be certain that this instability of their mental processes is due solely to maloperation of the thyroid gland.
“Five of these men, intractable and guilty of frequent attacks on other prisoners, were given treatment by operation. That is, the hyper-plastic or overdeveloped tissue and the adenomas (gland enlargement) were removed. All have shown marked improvement in behavior, their mental stability has increased, their tendency to impulsive action has been reduced, and it is strongly probable that they will leave the prison with minds more in accord with the processes of civilization, and more amenable to its limitations, than they ever have been.
“Another group of prisoners—not thyroid abnormals—was made up of men having a disorder of the pituitary gland, commonly diagnosed as being due to undersecretion of the anterior or forward lobe of this gland. It was learned from the records that more than eighty percent of these cases were ‘sent up’ for crimes of irresponsibility, such as forgery, embezzlement, bad-check passing, and petty theft.
“IT IS interesting to note that not one in this ‘pituitary group’ had committed any crime of violence.
“In daily life, these are the fat, good-natured men; irresponsible, usually living far beyond their means, always in need of money, and so abnormal in endocrinal condition that they follow the paths of least resistance. Yet they are extremely difficult to arouse to a fighting mood, and in their efforts to fulfill their desires, stop far short of violence of any kind.
“We found that, generally speaking, it was possible to modify in a marked degree the personalities of these men, giving them greater seriousness, making them more responsible, and fixing in their minds a stronger sense of their proper attitude toward their fellow men.
“We did this by administering what we found to be the proper combination of pituitary and other glandular extracts, which seem to act as catalyzers, or reagents in the distribution of the introduced pituitary substance.”
Doctor Reynolds and Doctor Stanley also worked with a third group of prisoners, known as the “dys-gonads” (those having badly developed sex glands), involving two divisions, the homosexuals and the undersexed. Most of these are furtive, secretive, unaggressive, harmless men, but here and there arises one who suddenly becomes vicious, without apparent reason. The majority of them are in prison for crimes of perversion, yet there are thousands of persons of similar type in society, hiding their perversions to such an extent that they never have fallen foul of the law.
Treatment of this type by glandular extract produced demonstrable, highly beneficial results, and there is little doubt in the mind of Doctor Reynolds that the pervert and degenerate types may be returned a long way toward normalcy by this artificial restoration of the balance of the sex glands.
Thus, the three departments of crime—acts of violence, attacks on property, and perversion—have been given tests of five years and proved to have their source in unbalanced mentality, produced by abnormalities in the glands of internal secretion. Yet both Doctor Reynolds and Doctor Stanley, pioneers and leaders in this study of glandular criminology, insist that the results obtained be regarded only as “experimental.”
“OF THE prisoners examined, numbering hundreds, eighty-five percent had a definite history of disorder of the endocrine glands in one or both parents,” continued Doctor Reynolds. “Similar abnormal conditions of these glands were found in grandparents, uncles, aunts, sisters, and brothers of these men.
“This points clearly to a powerful hereditary factor at work in disorders of the glands of internal secretion.
“It points also to the more illuminating truth that if the grandparents, or even the parents, of these men had been given proper medical and surgical treatment for their own glandular abnormalities, their children and their grandchildren would not have offended society, and would not now be in prison, burdens on that civilization whose rules they have broken because of the upsetting of their endocrinal gland balance.
“Beyond this somewhat scientific deduction, we are met squarely with the tremendous economic and sociological fact that if we remove the endocrine abnormalities from the children of today, we shall reduce greatly the crimes against the society of tomorrow. If we restore the balance of the thyroid gland in the throat of little Johnny Jones, thereby calming permanently his childish outbursts of temper, we are in a fair way to prevent a murder. If we train wee Billy Smith’s pituitary glands so that he refrains from stealing his neighbor’s apples, we have curbed the malsecretion of the gland which has put other and older men into prison for embezzlement and forgery.
“WE ARE becoming more and more certain that behind every ‘ backward’ and wayward’ child there is a physical reason. Something is wrong with the internal mechanism, the glandular chemistry, of that child’s body. If, through a study of the child’s endocrinal history, and a complete examination of its present condition, we can restore the balance of the gland influence on the child’s mentality, then we can remove what we call, for want of a better term, the ‘tendency to crime.’”
So much for the prevention of crime, for the averting, in youth, of a predisposition toward wrongdoing in later years. We have seen what Doctor Reynolds and Doctor Stanley have accomplished with the adult criminal in San Quentin prison. The logical path along which this work must go is the one of restoring to these men such mental balance that they will realize their responsibilities to themselves, to society, and to civilization. Doctor Reynolds believes that this can be done in many instances, but his demand is for time to observe the result of experimental surgical and medical work done on these prisoners.
Let Doctor Reynolds speak again: “We have with us another and larger group which has been only touched in this study of glandular balance and control. These are the persons who, we say casually, ‘have criminal faces’; scientifically, they are classified as having the stigmata of degeneration. Their facial abnormalities—from the sight of which the layman judges them to be at least potential criminals—are due to disturbances in growth and development. Endocrinologists, specialists in the study and treatment of endocrine glands, have come to look upon them as glandular subjects, inasmuch as virtually always their ancestry reveals a long and involved history of disarrangement of the glands of internal secretion.
“IN THE ancestry of such persons also appear insanity, epilepsy, feeble-mindedness, cataracts early in life, harelip, strabismus (commonly known as cross-eye’), and other defections from the normal, scientifically classified as ‘stigmata.’ Their histories often begin with a parent who, for example, had a pituitary abnormality, from which only other pituitary disarrangements will appear in the children for several generations. Then, quite suddenly, in one of these generations, the offspring will begin to show other defects in development, abnormalities of mind as well as of body.
“Often these ‘degenerations’ are not accompanied by any of the recognizable symptoms of gland disorders, and it is only from their histories that the true causes of their conditions, their physical, mental, and moral aberrations, may be obtained. For this reason medical science has been slow to accept the close relationship which undoubtedly exists between the ‘ man with the criminal face’ and glandular disarrangements.
“If the earlier stages of gland disorder are diagnosed and treated, much can be accomplished, but when the hereditary process has reached the point— several generations later— of pronounced stigmata of degeneration, segregation of these individuals seems to be the only method of eliminating their spread. Low fecundity and early death combine to wipe out this type, if so isolated that new blood cannot be brought in by marriage.
“ALL the types in our penal and corrective institutions, these seem to be the ones whose segregation and confinement is necessary until they die out, in spite of all that has been or can be done for them in the way of effort to restore their mental and physical stability by gland treatment.
“In the near future, large groups of prisoners at San Quentin and other penal institutions are to be classified as to the type of crime committed, and then studied as to the glandular disturbance which preponderates in each group. On the determination of the extent to which criminal tendencies can be reduced by restoration of the endocrine gland balance rests the greatest hope of modern society for the prevention of crime in future generations, and the reformation—or, better, the ‘remaking’— of the criminal in this generation.”
They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and this doctor obviously had a little knowledge of the endocrine system and the arrogance to run with it.
Jesus, this is just as bad as the theory of the four humors. Instead, there are the three glands, which by over- or underactivity define the character of the person.
I’m so glad science has found the reason for all of society’s ills. This great research has led to the eradication of our nation’s prisons and led to the total lockstep of today’s peaceful and contented citizens. Look at all the learned doctors that came aboard on this radical research. Thank god I had my Thyroid removed! Who knows how many lives this has saved!
One of the most chilling parts of this chilling article: ““We are beginning to accept the fact that the criminal is not essentially ‘bad’,” said Dr. Reynolds, “but that he merely is a person who shows a departure from what society has established as the ‘normal.’ ”
If you depart from what’s “normal,” you’ll be medicated and operated on till you conform.
If you look at the picture on page 21, second row middle…you can see Adolph Hitler. Check it yourself. Of cousre it figures.
I saw the part about male gonads. Just what is the normal size? Are TSA agents at the airports going to be measuring these as a way to spot terrorists? I wouldn’t doubt it.
And this sort of baloney is why Alan Turing didn’t live to see “Pac-Man”. (He killed himself after being forced to get estrogen injections to “cure” his homosexuality.)
Devak, nah, That mustache was popular mustache at the time. My Grandfather had one until the war.
This ranks alongside the Tuskagee experiments, MK Ultra,early radiation experiments for professional arrogance.Sadly it even goes on today look at the over medication of children for
a catch all behaviour problem Attention deficit disorder. I wonder if they sterilised a few of these feeble minded inmates in addition. Its like that movie judgement at Nuremberg?
They knew the nazi experiments were over the top but they didnt place the same viewpoint to these experiments.

You’ve been waiting. We’ve been waiting. The waiting is ovah. Done. Finished. Buh bye. Info on the 2012 MMVA wristbands is finally here! Oh, happy day!
Take a minute to go nuts and let your freak flag fly. Are we all chillaxed now? Awesome possum. I have ALL the info you need on wristbands in this post, so make sure you read this over a good THREE times. If you still have questions, feel free to leave them in the comments section below and I’ll do my best to put my thinking cap on and answer your Q’s.
Let’s begin, shall we?
Your Guideline for Getting Wristbands to the 2012 MMVAs:
* MMVAs wristband giveaway starts at 6 pm ET on Friday, June 8 during New.Music.Live. at MuchMusic.
* MuchMusic is located at 299 Queen St. West, Toronto at the corner of Queen and John St.
* For maximum safety and enjoyment, we ask that the wristband line up starts no sooner than Tuesday, June 5 at 7am. Anyone who comes down before that will be asked to return later.
* You must be at least 14 years old as of Sunday, June 17 to get wristbands. Not 14 in a month. Not 14 on June 18.
* You must have photo ID with you to get a wristband. School photo ID with your birth certificate, license, photo health card, TTC card or passport (actual or photocopied) is fine. We basically need any photo ID, but if it’s school ID/TTC card, we need your birth certificate too. If you have a clear photocopy of your birth certificate or passport, you can bring that instead of the real thing!
* One wristband per person. You cannot get one for your friend who couldn’t make it, even if she is the biggest Justin Bieber fan in the world. If you get a wristband we will put it on you and you MUST keep it on until the MMVAs on June 17.
* Wristbands are free. We cannot be bribed. If we could, I’d be writing this from a yacht in Tahiti.
Tips:
* If you do not get a wristband you can still totally watch the MMVAs from the street on June 17! And yes, you can still totally see the stages! There are no age limits for watching from the street. We lurve er’body.
* We will be giving some wristbands away through contests. Keep checking the MMVA 2012 site for updates on contests!
* How many wristbands are you giving out? Sorry, we can’t release that number.
* I can’t make it to MuchMusic on June 8. How can I get wristbands? Keep checking the MMVA 2012 site to find out about contests for winning wristbands.
* If I wear the wristband for 9 days before the MMVAs, won’t it fall off? Nope, it’s durable.
* Is it safe for me/my kids to line up over night? Our security staff will be monitoring the line-up at all times.
* How will I know where the line-up starts at MuchMusic? You’ll know once you get there, we promise.
* What if I don’t get a wristband on June 8 and don’t win one? You can still watch the MMVAs from the street. You can also line up to be part of the red carpet, and hopefully get an autograph from your favourite celeb.
* When can I begin lining up for a wristband? You may start lining up Tuesday, June 5 at 7 am.Anyone who comes down before that will be asked to return later. Since we don’t know how many people will begin lining up at Tuesday, June 5 at 7 am we can’t tell you when you should join the line. We will update the MMVA site with information on how long the wristband line up extends on a daily basis.

As my assignment in Vietnam drew to a close I found myself mesmerized by the Vietnamese people.
The rural areas such as Hue were especially remarkable. Hue, once the imperial capital, was the second leg of the Vietnam veterans’ return to the country. The city is a significant stop for the veterans. It was the site of one of the Vietnam War’s fiercest battle, the Battle of Hue, during the Tet Offensive of 1968. There was a huge loss of lives in Hue and major physical damage to the city’s infrastructure.
Hue seems to be stuck in another time. Larger cities like Hanoi in the North and Ho Chi Minh City in the South are virtually modern in comparison. In some instances it seems as if the people of Hue never left the 19th century.
In a funeral procession I photographed the mourners wearing 1800′s-styled clothing. The rice farmer uses the very same method of planting and harvesting her crop that have been used for generations and beyond. Seeing the two boys riding on water buffaloes instead of playing video games harkens me back to an earlier time, before the digitalization of society.
I found all of it engaging! I was impressed by how the Vietnamese carried on with their lives despite the ever present wounds of wars and hardships they endure. The people of Vietnam have a spirit that is hard to put into words but left an impression on me that will last my lifetime.

Politics continues to intrude on our fantasy lives this week in the form of DCU: Decisions #1. By most accounts it was a predictable story, but it included an unexpected reveal about Lois Lane.
Chris J. Miller gives the details:
Perhaps the only unexpected relevation [sic] in the issue is that Lois Lane is “proudly for a strong military, small government, low taxes, and maximum individual freedom.” This is presumalby [sic].
Other reviewers were less generous:
[T]his book is Judd Winick writing Green Arrow as a clueless moron and Bill Willingham writing Lois Lane as Ann Coulter.
Stop it.
Just stop it.
I could understand if they said that Batman was a Republican. Or Alan Scott. Or Wonder Woman. Heck, it could even have been an interesting twist if Hawkgirl voted Republican.
By there is NO FREAKIN’ WAY that Lois Lane is a Republican.
That is all.
By defining the political leanings of these characters, DC has instantly alienated a lot of the readership. While this first issue does not clearly state the big three’s views, it does define them for other important characters, most notably Lois Lane. They made Lois a Republican. It makes no sense. And it has pissed a lot of people off.
I have to say I’d be annoyed if the rationale for her party membership was just because she was a military brat. Contrary to popular belief, Republicans do not hold a monopoly on the loyalty of military members. It’s pretty damned annoying that so much of the military’s representation in popular culture is painted red and riding elephants. I’d like to see the sort of people I’ve actually met in the military as characters in pop culture. I’m tired of the Conservative Christian Family Values General, okay? I want to see the atheist NCO gun enthusiast, or the liberal conspiracy theorist technician, or the socially conservative Wiccan from personnel reflected in our entertainment. I know it’s a cliche, but could you think outside the box for five seconds? There are all sorts of people in foxholes.
But if this was a way of making a point about her as a journalist, then I have to say it has potential. Probably not under these writers (Honestly, Wonder Woman decides who to vote for based on their military prowess? Have they ever read her book?! Do they really think she’s so one-dimensional?), but someone with some characterization skill can take this development and get some good story material out of it. How she’s registered doesn’t necessary match with how she marks her ballot. Lane, as characterized over the past 60 years, probably votes for the least corrupt person on the ballot. She most likely decides who’s the least corrupt after investigating them herself. If her ideals tend to be conservative, and the conservative candidate turns out to be corrupt while the liberal candidate is an honest person, there’s some internal conflict for Lois. And what does she do when the conservative candidate is more religious and moralizing than she’s comfortable with? There’s some good election tale fodder here.
I don’t have faith that DCU Decisions will make good use of it, but then I have low expectations for these writers. (And the Wonder Woman thing really doesn’t help.) But some future Superman writer could get a really great story out of Lois Lane, Registered Republican.
September 19th, 2008 at 7:29 pm
I haven’t read the material, but if Chris J. Miller’s description of it is accurate, it doesn’t sound to me like Lois is a Republican. Rather, it sounds like she’s a Libertarian. And that would go well with a career as a journalist, with marrying an illegal alien, and with supporting her husband’s vigilante tendencies.
September 19th, 2008 at 7:38 pm
I hope all these people realize that there are probably as many people as they who think Lois being a Republican makes perfect sense.
I know people who I always imagined were Republican actually turn out to be Democrat and the other way around.
Isn’t this part of the greatness of America?
I really feel sorry for anyone who is alienated by Lois because it turns out the character is Republican.
September 19th, 2008 at 8:11 pm
I’d consider Lois more a pragmatic conservative. In Canada, she’d likely be what we used to call a “Red Tory”, back when there really were Tories. She’s seen enough to know when the other side of an argument’s got ideas worth acting on.
Looking forward to seeing how the rest of this plays out…and how a meeting with Icon and the Rocket would go for her.
September 19th, 2008 at 8:47 pm
I look at all that and go “sounds like a Democrat to me”. Or at least my definition of what I want.
I don’t think anyone’s going to ever literally SAY a party they belong to. They’ll say enough bout what they believe in that everyone will go “They belong to……”
But I bet everyone’s gonna see something that makes them say its their party over everyone elses.
Which just means its all universal in the end.

September 20th, 2008 at 5:07 am
Hey! Many thanks for linking to my still-infant blog! (Obviously, one thing I’m going to have to do is keep a closer eye on my typos. Sorry about those [sic]s!)
I agree with Lisa that the revelation about Lois *could* be interesting (if only as an ironic inversion of the “liberal media” meme), but the story as written lives down to her low expectations: Lois’ own dialogue says “You always know who I vote for… I’m a product of my upbringing.” Nuance? Internal conflict? What are those?
(Unlike Matt Morrison, though, I’m not sure who to blame for this dialogue, or any other. Most of it reads like Willingham’s work to me, but I could be wrong.)
I don’t think the plot is as awful as some others do, nevertheless. Yes, it’s a bit odd to see the JLA on point for presidential candidates’ security, especially for what appears to be a non-meta threat, but other than that it more-or-less hangs together so far. Anyway, like I wrote earlier — as both a political junkie and a comics fan, I just can’t help being curious.

I predict there will be 50,000 commenters on this comic with only 20,000 copies sold. Everybody’s got an opinion. What they really need is an informed opinion.
September 20th, 2008 at 11:58 am
Lois being a Republican goes against everything established about the character imo. I agree with the poster who said not all military folk are conservatives, although her father has in fact been portrayed that way, and she’s been portrayed as rebelling. She’s a reform minded feminist exposer of truth. George W. Bush would give her gas pains.
I agree with what Evan said, even though that’s how Republicans define themselves, it’s closer to how Democrats are in real life, except perhaps for the “low taxes” bit, but the Republicans are the same on taxes, except if you’re a millionaire.
September 20th, 2008 at 3:49 pm
Willingham is the the conservative of the two, blame him for making Lois one. This whole miniseries should be pulped IMO.
September 20th, 2008 at 6:26 pm
Without knowing which writer is taking responsibility for which parts, I’d suspect Winnick wrote Lois Lane’s dialog here. Whether he believes the dialog or not isn’t the point here, but it just smells like typical Winnick ‘hit-’em-over-the-head-with-it writing.
September 21st, 2008 at 12:07 pm
Hasn’t anyone ever heard of the moderate New England Republicans, also known as Rockefeller Republicans, a quickly dying branch of the Republican Party? It’s actually not a bad place for Lois to be on the political spectrum, balancing both her army brat upbringing with a strong sense of social justice. Unfortunately, it’s a horrible place to be in today’s more fundamentalist Republican Party (just ask former senator Lincoln Chafee).
September 22nd, 2008 at 11:07 am
It fits quite well with the Margot Kidder version of Lois. And neatly overturns the cliche that every newspaper journalist is a lefty (by US standards).
Can’t see the problem.
September 22nd, 2008 at 11:14 pm
Hmmm…that “New England Republican” angle might go well with certain theories on Metropolis’ location on the map of New Earth’s version of the USA…
November 28th, 2008 at 3:11 am
Thank God Lois is a republican! She’s very smart and well informed so it’s no surprise she would be a Republican.
November 28th, 2008 at 12:00 pm
So, Nicky… Lois also thinks President-Elect Obama is Muslim, thinks Obama “pals around with terrorists,” thinks living in Alaska gives one foreign policy experience or that going into Iraq (while bin Laden is still on the loose) has been a positive, successful experience? Certainly she feels the economy has been really strong the past few years, right?
Yeah, very smart and informed indeed…
And to think some Republicans have accused Dems of “drinking the Kool-Aid” this year. More accurately, lots of people just changed to a different, more palatable flavor after eight years.

That’s an apt answer to an ientrsetnig question
<|endofexample|>
Claire Sambrook teaches at The University of Portsmouth and is helping organise the Love Your Bike event in Portsmouth tomorrow. They’ve made a newspaper for the event and we asked her to write a little bit about it for the blog.
The weather is supposed to be nice tomorrow, you should pop down to Portsmouth. It sounds like a great day.
As part of Love Your Bike Portsmouth a goodie pack has been produced which includes a cyclist bag, bike charm necklace, spoke cards and a newspaper. This 1st edition newspaper features 50 cyclists from around the city telling their stories of their bikes and why they love them.
Love Your Bike Portsmouth aims to encourage participants to fully embrace the possibilities of connecting with their bikes and explore the many ways that they can improve it’s appearance and design. Bike culture is an important part of cycling and regaining the streets. With this in mind, the event also aims to get more and more people using their bikes around the city. It’s a celebration of all the innovators who design and create wonders on two wheels. If you love your bike then you will use it more often. The event will feature workshops, bike demo’s, bike polo, marketstalls, bike artwork, bike safety and a showcase bike arena.
Ben Wilson, Death Spray Custom, Tokyo Fixed Gear, Raw Bamboo Bikes and Gocycle are amongst some of the participants and I Love Dust have designed the branding and newspaper.
Follow the event at loveyourbikeportsmouth.co.uk
(A footnote from the Art Dept. Claire tells me that I Love Dust used our InDesign template to help them design this newspaper.)

A story about exceptional service
Wednesday, August 26, 2009
Recently I found myself constrained by the puny 200GB of my Mac Book Pro and I bought a 500GB Seagate drive to replace it (a fast 7200 rpm one).
The Macbook Pro has no easy access for the drive so you have to resort to dismantling the case to access it. This put me off replacing the drive because I would probably be voiding the warranty and was running the risk of damaging this expensive piece of equipment.
I’ve been filling the drive with pictures from my recent camera purchase and I couldn’t put it off any longer, so I bought the new drive and went online to find some good tutorial on how to crack open the Macbook Pro case.
After a few searches, I noticed that many people were referring to the iFixit.com website.
It was very easy to find the tutorial I was looking for, I didn’t have to register, and each step was made very clear and simple.
It took no time to open the case and replace the drive.
I was very happy with that find.
Now, that’s not the end of the story.
A couple of days before I replaced the drive the left fan of the laptop suddenly became noisy. This would happen a few times a day, at random, and would last 10-20 minutes.
My only solution to get this repaired was to get to the local Apple service shop. Even though I knew exactly which part number was to be replaced, they still wanted me to:
- go across town to visit them so they could see for themselves what the problem was: annoying because the problem was intermittent so I may have to go for nothing.
- wait for the part to arrive a few days later.
- go back to leave the laptop
- go again to collect the repaired laptop the next day or so. So all in all: about 6h spend travelling back and forth + no laptop for a couple of day + the risk that some indiscreet technician start looking through my personal stuff.
Instead, I went back to the iFixit website:
- identified my machine
- found out the list of spare parts available from their store
- added the fan to my cart
- paid for it.
- found a guide that showed how to replace the part.
That took me all of 10 minutes; I placed my order on Thursday and the next Monday I received the part … halfway across the globe!
I also got a survey request from iFixit and left some comments, from which I got back two nice detailed email follow-ups, one from the CEO saying they were implementing my remarks as part of their site improvement efforts.
Well, I thought I would share this story. It’s not that often that you get excited by an online vendor that not only does its job well but goes beyond expectations.

Here are a few tidbits of local restaurant/bar news from our lovely Beaumont Village area:
As most everyone probably knows by now, Fife closed earlier this year. The premiere restaurant in the Village is set to be replaced by Soluna Grill, run by a new chef in town who lives about two miles from the restaurant. Soluna is set for a September 1st opening. Will it be able to garner the same status Fife did? We will have to wait to see.
UPDATE: It was confirmed to me Parisi's will close by August 22. A new, as yet not named, restaurant will reportedly be taking over the space. The reason for leaving - tired of doing retail - that's fair. Word is Parisi's, the gelato shop in the same center as Green Dog Pet Supply, is closing. No word as to why, but it is said they will be out by mid-August.
Vite, the wine bar behind Parisi's, is under new management and will open afternoons coming up in the next few weeks.
Blackbird Wine Shop is preparing to expand, taking over the larger space along Fremont which once housed Bella Lulu's. They've got a liquor license already posted in the window and it is said by businesses around them they will be offering nibbles in house to enjoy with their wines.

From the Adidas America sports laboratory on the bluff overlooking downtown Portland comes this: The Lightest Basketball Shoe Ever.
That's how Adidas is billing the adiZero Crazy Light basketball shoe, which is being introduced today at an event in New York. The shoe is 9.8 ounces in size 10, which Adidas says is two ounces lighter than the nearest competitor. That said, the authoritative blog CounterKicks is reporting that Nike Basketball's Kobe VI shoe weighs 10.2 ounces.
Davis, trained in sports physiology, said the design team, led by shoe designer Robbie Fuller, set out with the goal of crafting a structurally sound shoe of 10 ounces or lighter. The shoe was designed for the Germany-based company in the North American headquarters on North Greeley Avenue in the Overlook neighborhood.
Instead of taking an existing design and stripping it of weighty components, Davis said the team instead began with the approach of...nothing. The team added essentials to a bare foot, starting with a footbed and moving from there.
Lawrence Norman, vice president of global basketball for Adidas America, has traveled the country introducing the adiZero Crazy Light to NBA players under contract with Adidas, including Chicago Bulls guard and MVP candidate Derrick Rose. Rose is going to wear the adiZero Crazy Light during the Bulls' playoff run, Norman said.
Adidas introduces the adiZero Crazy Light well aware that Nike, Inc., with its Nike, Jordan and Converse brands, commands about 95 percent of U.S. basketball shoe sales. The Oregon sports equipment giant is led by the Jordan Brand, which, according to Matt Powell, footwear analyst for SportsOneSource, accounts for nearly 65 percent of sales, followed by Nike, with nearly 28 percent. Adidas is third, with slightly less than 3 percent.
Norman said he is not daunted by those numbers, saying of the adiZero Crazy Light: "One show can make all the difference."

Penn State defeated Ohio State 5-4 at the Three Rivers Classic in Pittsburgh on December 29th. That win was a great result for the program but it was made even more memorable and fun as sophmore goalie PJ Musico was mic'd up during warm-ups and the game itself.
As many of you are aware, the California native is not only a great goaltender on the ice but he is also a fun guy off the ice. His style of play and great athleticism are what got the attention of both Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky and "Stack the Pads".
PJ has contributed to the blog in the past through a "Stack the Pads" Q&A. He is currently 8-8 on the season with a 3.03 gaa and a 90.4 save%. See below for some cool video of him talking us through warm-ups and reacting to the goals that led to the huge 5-4 victory over Ohio State.
Penn State will take on the United States U18 National Team this coming Friday at the Greenberg Ice Pavillion. Area fans will get to see Musico and the rest of the Penn State Nittany Lion ice hockey team in action at GIANT Center against Ohio University on Friday February, 1st.
"Thank You Terry" did yet another update on the construction of the Pegula Ice Arena. If you have not seen pictures recently you really need to check this out. The venue is shaping up to be pretty spectacular.

An article in today’s Sunday Times, highlighted by SpyBlog and Ben Goldacre has revealed what the Sunday Times describes as the “discreet monitoring” or “snoop(ing) on the habits of millions of EE phone customers” as they came out of London’s Oxford Circus station. In other words, EE were monitoring and recording the actions of their customers and giving the data to Ipsos Mori in what is, no doubt a potentially very profitable enterprise.
Ipsos Mori was delighted with the results. In a deal with EE — Britain’s biggest mobile phone company, formed in 2010 from a merger between Orange and T-Mobile — the polling firm had purchased the exclusive use of the phone data and the test run in central London had shown its potential.
There are some serious echoes of Phorm here.

Every time I conduct an interview, I try to get it recorded. I have tried out several high-end recorders, only to find out the are "too good." Too many times when I have used the high end products, they are too sensitive and pick up way too much background noise. When I say recorders - I am speaking of digital recorders. I do not use tape any longer - it is just logistically too impractical. The 4th recorder I decided to try out was basically out of need. I had sent back another expensive model, and I needed one as a stop-gap measure. I bought a $59 model from Wal~Mart.
The recorder I got was a Sony ICD-PX312 digital recorder. It has a removable micro-SD card (which was one of the few requirements I have). It can record in several formats, and has several quality settings. I stated off using everything in the middle range. It it easy to set up and easy to use. I can turn the recorder on and lock the power button so it continually records conversations. I put the recorder in my pocket and conduct the interview. It doesn't matter if it is a shirt or pants pocket - it records the conversation really well.
I would have to give this recorder a 5 out of 5 rating if I had a system. It is easy to use, easy to set up and always gives me a great recording. This equipment is standard issue for everyone working for me.
If you use something that works really well, I would like to hear from you.

Cisco puts a virtual router in the clouds, and a virtual server in a router, among other unnatural acts.
As we like it, 2012 of Cloud Connected Solution for Cisco user.
According to Cisco’s Global Cloud Networking Survey for 2012, the majority of IT “decision makers” cite a cloud-ready network as the biggest requirement to foster the migration of business applications to the cloud. It is against this backdrop that Cisco developed the Connected Cloud Solution.
The Cisco Cloud Connected Solution is comprised of:
Cloud Connectors: new software embedded into the Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) G2 platform along with services that improve the performance, security and availability of cloud applications. The open architecture of the Cloud Connectors allows service providers and channel partners to develop third-party Cloud Connectors to help them deliver differentiated services to their customers.
Cloud-enabled platforms: the new Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) is a virtual router that enables customers to extend their virtual private networks (VPNs) into the cloud. Cisco is also expanding the Aggregation Services Router (ASR) platform with the Cisco ASR 1002-X router, and introducing the Cisco UCS E-Series Server Modules on the ISR G2, delivering lean branch solutions by hosting multiple third party services on a single branch platform.
Innovative cloud services: new capabilities added to existing routing and WAN optimization platforms to better support cloud computing, including the new Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC) technology integrated into the Cisco ISR and ASR platforms to optimize the delivery and troubleshooting of cloud applications on the network; and Cisco UCS E-Series Server Modules on the ISR G2. New Cisco AppNav technology intelligently clusters Cisco’s Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) physical and virtual appliances into a single resource pool managed by a central controller. (Cisco UCS) E-Series.
Supporting Quotes
Praveen Akkiraju, senior vice president and general manager, Cisco Services Routing Technology Group: “As businesses are driving the rapid adoption of cloud based services, routing platforms and the WAN have become a strategic control point to provide an optimal user experience across the cloud. The Cisco Cloud Connected Solution redefines the WAN architecture with key innovations that leverage the network intelligence as a critical link in cloud deployments by putting more functionality into traditional enterprise routing, allowing customers to connect to the cloud with an optimal user experience.”″)

It’s 8:15 in the morning Tuesday as I start writing this, and the Mariners have just gone in to the all-purpose room in their Peoria, Ariz. complex for their annual meet-and-greet.
There are new players that members of the front office have to meet. There are new members of the front office (admittedly not at high levels) that the players have to meet.
There are new rules to go over. There are talks about the organization’s baseball goals, its charitable goals, its attendance goals, its media goals, all put forward by CEO Howard Lincoln and president Chuck Armstrong.
After that the crowd will thin a little and general manager Bill Bavasi and manager Mike Hargrove will step forward and address the players.
Hargrove said the meeting is important because it sets the tone of the camp, and by extension, of the whole season.
It will last about an hour.

Noven Pharmaceuticals, a Miami pharmaceutical company, is working with Procter & Gamble on a testosterone patch in continuing attempts to find a treatment for women with low sexual desire.
Although the patch still has to gain regulatory approval, speculation already is occurring about how many women would receive help from the patch.
The patch could help some women, especially those near menopause with low testosterone levels, Amanda Richards-Bullock, an obstetrician- gynecologist at the University of Miami, said in a Miami Herald article.
Other women may need different treatments. They could be depressed, be overextended, or have a physical problem, such as vaginal pain. Taking antidepressants also can cause reduce sex drive.
Richards-Bullock thinks boomer women will want solutions to a low sex drive to have an equivalent to Viagra, which helps many men improve their sexual performance.
”Prior to the Viagra era, women just accepted that men lost interest” as they got older and women did too, she said in the article. ”But now men are continuing to have satisfying activity,” thanks to the blue-diamond pills, and they’re looking to their spouses to join them.
Low sexual drive is a recognized disorder in medical textbooks, Eva Ritvo, a University of Miami psychiatrist, said in article. “For some patients, it can be an agonizing problem,” Ritvo said, adding, “But if a woman gets to a certain age and isn’t bothered by a lack of desire, that’s fine too.”
The testostrone patch has been on the market for some time in Europe. It’s approved for use only for women who have had hysterectomies.
No estimated date is available for when the patch could appear on the market. Procter & Gamble began working with Noven five years ago on the patch, and has been in talks with the Food and Drug Administration for four years on how to proceed. No agreement has been reached with the federal agency.

As you may have noticed, if you read this little bloglet, TPF has been on a very brief hiatus while The Fool and my adamantly Un-Foolish Significant Other took a wee camping trip down to Kanaskat Palmer State Park, a place I highly recommend for those who want to escape King County, Washington, while not actually leaving it. Laying there under a bell-clear summer sky at night, listening to the Green River murmur its run-off-swollen blues, well, it may not be Paris but it’ll do for what ails ya.
Elk Head is in a tiny industrial park on the “outskirts” of what might be called “downtown Buckley”. It’s almost the last building on 410 as you push on to the west, the setting sun, and all the Glory That Is Tacoma. You enter through a regular door, next to a roll-up door which, on this hot-ish summer day, was open to expose a beautiful burgundy old panel van, emblazoned with Elk Head’s logo on the side. Inside the door was a long counter fronting a wall of 14 beer taps, all of which, shockingly, held a different beer. The guy behind the counter could not possibly have been more welcoming and cheerful, short of offering a back-rub, something I try to avoid when tasting beer. (It makes the beer slosh out of my glass.) We told him we’d like to taste everything and he said “Okay!” No dickering about tasting flight charges, no dialog about only allowing four-to-six tastes, he simply dragged out a tiny, two-ounce miniature beer stein and got to work.
I’m not going to go through all 14 beers because we both have to get on with our days, but I will mention several things that really deserve your attention (provided you ever find yourself in Buckley) and say that, whatever was in the back of my mind about Elk Head Brewing of Buckley, Washington, what we found there vastly exceeded expectations.
The first pour was a pale ale infused with citrus fruits, “Citronic”. As these fruit-laced beers go, this was a gem; a jazzy package of fresh fruit flavors that present emphatically without taking over the beer. My big peeve with citrus beers is that the beer frequently disappears. Brewer Rich Dirk has balanced this one masterfully, letting the lemon, orange, and lime notes ride atop the lovely grain and toasted bread flavors. The light touch of banana worked as a gentle accent and the total effect was as refreshing a thing as I’ve tasted this summer.
Elk Head “Kilted Elk” is just simply a top-shelf Scottish ale; a strappin’ mouthful of mellow, caramel-drenched malts, married to some impressively assertive hops, producing a balance that a lot of American Scottishes fall well short of. This is Scottish ale as they understand it in Scotland, where hops are not as widely grown as around here and they’ve historically made maximum use of what’s on hand. This actually reminded me a lot of Belhaven “Wee Heavy”, on a slightly smaller scale, packing in Scotch ale muscle into a Scottish framework, to make an incredibly satisfying brew that will stand up well when you’re having more than one. This is just a flat-out delicious beer and will compare favorably to any Scottish made anywhere in the Northwest.
I’m instantly suspicious of any brewery that gets too esoteric with their choices in additives. I’m wrong about that, frequently, and always happy to be so but I approach any beer with more than three or four infusions as I would a sleeping rattlesnake. The last beer on the taps was “Elk Dandee”, a 9.2% ABV whopper of a Pale, infused with dandelions(!), ginger, and ginseng. I tasted it with a reflexive scowl already in place and relaxed the second it hit my palate. “Dandee” is a solid effort. This is refreshing, silky, and the exact opposite of overdone; subtle, immensely flavorful, and beautifully made. The fine, faint dandelion flavors – which I know quite well from my childhood experiments with dandelion wine, in my Virginia mountains birthplace – presents right up front, a mild, sweet tang that suggests fresh dill and bananas. Behind that, the ginger – which normally hijacks any liquid it’s mixed into – lays back prettily, adding a brisk bite without overdoing it. And the ginseng adds it’s signature note of radish to the finish, pulling the ale back from excess sweetness. As these Asian-inspired ales go, this is as good as I’ve found from any Washington Brewer.
But the star of the show was what Dirk and Company call “Blast Zone”, a dazzling chile beer that very nearly redeems many of the truly grotesque examples of this style I’ve forced down, over the past ten years. Like many people, I tasted Cave Creek Chile Beer as my first chile ale and the memory of that horror sometimes wakes me up in the night, drenched in sweat. Since that one, back in 1991, I’ve tasted about two dozen but never one as fleshed-out, thoughtful, and enormously flavorful as this EH version. This is quite simply the best chile beer I’ve ever tasted, from anywhere. Rich Dirk used several medium-to-hot chiles, fresh, and put half the yield into a Traeger smoker. This smoking shows up beautifully in this ale, tinging the lovely, bright flavor of the Serranos and jalapenos with a firm smoke character reminiscent of a fine Euro Rauchbier like Bamberg or Aecht Schlenkerla. The peppery burn starts within about five seconds and stays managably warm, comfortably warm, on the palate. The flavors have almost nothing in common with typical chile ales, in which the burn delivers nearly absent of any trace of the actual peppers. This stuff came home with us in a pint growler and it was even better the next evening, as we sipped it contemplatively on our patio. The whole trip down to Buckley would have been justified to get this alone but, added to the other great stuff we found, we’re planning another trip to Elk Head any time we’re within 20 miles of the place.
Just a word,too, is in order about…well, the vibe of the place. It goes beyond just that Elk Head Brewing is located in a small town and all the all-American images that conjures up. We arrived just about opening time. We were nearly the first ones in the door and the crowds arrived right behind us. Clearly, the folks at the brewery know – and like – most of their customers. And just as clearly, these folks do not just come in to drink whatever mild, inoffensive analog of Bud Light EH may have on tap. There was a lot of sampling, lots of laughs, and an immensely unhurried, un-prissy, down-home atmosphere. We both remarked on it: this is just a completely likable brewery, particularly in contrast to a couple of Seattle-area operations we’ve visited that have been in business for less than two years and already have an (unwarranted) Attitude and rock-star swagger that would register from outer space. Elk Head Brewing was a true breath of fresh air that anyone who’s a real beer lover – and not just interested in beer for the Hipness Quotient – can appreciate.
I sometimes get all puffed up with myself and forget that great beer – great anything, really – is not the sole province of cities and their cool, uber-hip urban breweries. Within the past three months, we’ve tasted literally revelatory ales from Kent, Wenatchee, Poulsbo, Waitsburg, and Stevenson, Washington, and Enterprise, Oakridge, Pendleton, and Ashland, Oregon. Now, we can add Buckley, WA, to our must-visit list, for a periodic catch-up on what Rich and his inspired crew are whupin’ up lately.

Fresh from five days in Barbados earlier this year, tight end Vernon Davis dominated Wednesday’s practice catching at least six passes from a combination of Shaun Hill and Alex Smith during last week’s OTA practices. Now entering his fourth season and with an offensive coordinator who likes to highlight the tight end, Davis has the best opportunity yet to realize his sixth overall selection potential.
“He (new offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye) told me the tight end is the focal point,” Davis said Wednesday. “I’m looking forward it. He said he wants to get his playmakers involved.”
Looking the part has never been an issue for Vernon Davis.
Davis has a year of frustration to unleash after his minimized role last season in Mike Martz’s offense. He went from 52 passes in 2007 to 31 last year, despite Martz’s declaration in training camp that he was making a special play list just for Davis. Either Martz couldn’t break his habit of having a receiver-dominated offense, or Davis never caught onto Martz’s system. Either way, Davis said he spent some time in Mike Singletary’s office pining for more opportunities.
“It was real frustrating,” Davis said. “I thought when you pick a guy with the sixth pick (in the 2006 draft) that you pick him to make plays. So my thing, was I was just trying to be patient.”
Raye’s development of Kansas City tight end and former Cal star Tony Gonzalez is a highlight in Raye’s resume.
“I talked to Tony all the time,” Davis said. “He said Jimmy would take of me and make sure I would get the ball and stuff like that. I’m just looking forward to the opportunity.”
If Davis is going to be an elite tight end, this will have to be his year, not only because of Raye but because he’s showing the maturity to handle the responsibility of becoming a major piece of the offense. On Wednesday for example, linebacker Mark Washington ran down Davis from behind and tried to deck him during the non-contact team drills. The Davis of early days would have tried to punch Washington in the throat. Instead, Davis calmly walked back to the huddle while coaches admonished Washington.
“I don’t have time for fighting,” Davis said. “If it’s during a game, that might be different. But out here, I got to concentrate on what I’m doing.”
Despite learning a new offense, Davis said he’s comfortable with Raye’s scheme and it looked like it in the week of practices. In fact, the 49ers gave him the day off Thursday after he dominated on Wednesday.
Davis also said he tried to get the higher ups to take a hard look at his little brother Vontae, one of the top cornerbacks to come out of this year’s draft. In light of Walt Harris’s season-ending and perhaps career-ending knee injury, it would have been a good idea.
“He’s going to be great,” Davis beamed with brotherly pride. “Press coverage? Forget it. He’ll kill it.” Davis said he has trouble getting off of his younger bro’s press coverage. Vontae was selected 25th overall by Bill Parcells’ Dolphins, despite his prima donna rep. The younger Davis was demoted by Illinois coach Ron Zook for goofing off in practice.
On second thought, maybe two Davises on one one team is one too many.

I know. It’s the day after Christmas, and we should be thinking about warm, wholesome things, but there is still some housekeeping left to do, worst movies of the year lists to be written. Hence today’s topic. My end of the year worst-movies list will be running on December 31st. In the meantime, refresh your memory of some of the year’s worst films and devise your own top ten worst list.
Word of warning. With such an embarrassment of riches, it’s hard to narrow it down to ten. what from 2012 might qualify for all-time worst consideration.

I’d wager that within moments of Melky Cabrera’s 50-game suspension, Brian Sabean wrote him off as a Giant. I’d bet that down in the clubhouse, the feeling was mutual. In the wake of today’s revelation by the New York Daily News, there’s no longer any doubt. Cabrera won’t ever wear the San Francisco uniform again.
Put it this way: If the Giants still plan on reaching out to Cabrera, they won’t care that they’re known as “Steroid Central” around baseball circles these days. And they’ll go ahead and activate Guillermo Mota, a patently absurd notion, when his 100-game suspension ends.
The Daily News is reporting that “in a bizarre attempt” to avoid a 50-game drug suspension, Cabrera “created a fictitious website and a nonexistent product designed to prove he inadvertently took the banned substance that caused a positive test.” The story went on to report that  Cabrera’s urine.”
(Note: These “reports” come and go, often to be exposed as spectacularly inaccurate. The Daily News’ investigative team is perhaps the most reliable in the newspaper business.)
The key words there are “associates and entourage.” I seriously doubt that Cabrera came up with this pathetic scheme on his own. If this is the incident that keeps him out of baseball — not just in San Francisco, but anywhere — he won’t be happy with the jokers who handle his business.
As we’ve seen in San Diego, the Giants have a great thing going on the field. There’s tremendous spirit in the dugout; everyone’s coming through. It’s plain to see that the team is on a forget-Melky mission to make the playoffs, and I think they have a damned good chance. As far as the players are concerned, today’s news is unsettling from a personal standpoint. Most of the players found Cabrera to be a genuinely nice guy, and he was obviously a big part of their lineup. As of now, though, he’s a complete afterthought. No need to even consider the notion of bringing him back.

Bohemia of Finances (pt. 4)March 8, 2011 | By
Filed under: Conversations,, today an e-mail conversation with the amazing American writer Eileen Myles.
EM: I was a full-time academic from 2002 through the end of 2007. So I get a small allowance from them. I’m on the dole. Before then I taught workshops sporadically and wrote freelance, read, and performed. And since then (the full-time academic job) I’ve been writing mainly, my own stuff and lots of different kinds of journalism, art writing, writing about books, etc. Blogs. I’ve been traveling doing readings, having a semester-long visiting writer job, a bunch of short-term — one or two week — ones, and I guess that’s about it. I’ve gotten some grants, too.
BB: You’ve done a lot of writing about visual arts and artists. Other artists and writers I’ve talked to in this series have drawn attention to the somewhat thorny relation of the visual art world to the centers of financial capital. Especially when the work itself seems to advocate for an exploited or alienated class, an oppressed and brutalized gender, or sexuality — the “inevitable” transformation of these works into objects of sale seems paradoxical or at least … complicated! Does this seem like a fair description?
EM: Yeah, yet I think that exchange is one of the few ways some of those exploited or alienated peoples or causes do get expressed. I mean, outside of the academy and political papers and websites. It’s visible, and that seems valuable somehow. Even to make monuments to be sold. I remember seeing genital mutilation (of women) exist as a page of print in a vitrine in a Wolfgang Tillmans show. I wasn’t so much appalled as interested in the fact that a man could include that info in his work, and I couldn’t think of a single woman who would or could. All of this in a world where politicians may or may not rally at all to save any kind of public funding for art in America. And, increasingly, fashion and the design industry is supporting the visual arts. It seems more melancholy than paradoxical.
BB: And then, I guess, I’m wondering if you track a different situation for writing versus the more generally commodified art world?
EM: You mean in the way that we make wider claims for more kinds of people with fewer sales in quieter venues? Writing is less splashy for sure. Smarter in more complex ways, less sophisticated in other ways. Our society is more about the world but in itself less worldly. I think the arc of being innovative is a little more desperate in writing and more uneventful. Our world is less brash than the art world, I mean in terms of our relationship to media and the artist’s expectation of being heard. In writing, the part of the world that labels itself experimental is often kind of old-fashioned. Or maybe just not interested in fashion. Which is not bad, but it’s slower and quieter. Big publishing is in the hands of oafs largely. There’s a big opportunity for détente in art and writing, but I keep saying this maybe while it’s passing. Sometimes I think it’s two snow globes next to each other. Someone warm needs to pick them up and give a talk perhaps. Or make a movie about what’s real inside of them. Have you noticed airport security bans the carrying of snow globes? They’re a weapon, it turns out. I’m not sure what I’m talking about.
BB: In the Valentine’s Day piece, which appeared in Awl, you write, “Is writing just a job. Writing books, writing poems. If it is then the message to women is to go elsewhere.” You note that recent numbers analysis of poetry reviews show supposed sex parity, but also that the majority of people writing poetry are women.
Does the fact of the “fewer sales in quieter venues” make the poetry world a place less inclined to send this message to women? Like, while there’s still no shortage of the heroic guy poet thing, in that “experimental” poetry world I’m at least hearing the questions and challenges that seem feminist.
EM: I think the poetry world you’re describing in so many ways is women. It’s women-driven. Increasingly we’re actually seeing women including men in their things. Our neck of the woods is probably the best there is. I think we just have to resist being precious and guarding our borders too hard. Not looking out.
BB: I’m just curious — what does “sophistication” mean to you? I’ve been obsessed with it as a thing just out of reach, being raised in a sort of backwards, rural meth-town in middle America and moving to San Francisco at 18.
EM: Yeah, I’m from suburban working class Massachusetts. Not much culture there. Though it wasn’t far. But still you had to get on the bus. I always knew the kids on the bus going to Cambridge were the sophisticated ones. I suppose that’s it. Being sophisticated has something to do with having a choice and making it. Creating an aesthetic. Knowing what’s out there and not being beholden to it and not being oblivious of it either. You don’t even have to do a lot. Culture is exhausting, right. But I think there’s an increasingly wide band of hunters and gatherers working across the art-making worlds, and they are the most sophisticated people I know. I vote for seeing them get rewarded for doing this crucial work of doing and knowing. But you know it is its own reward to know. We don’t do this ’cause it’s NOT a pleasure.
BB: What’s your take on the economics of “coming up” or, to use artist-speak, “emerging”? Reading Inferno, I got the impression of this lost New York City, a place that somebody goes to be an artist and can do that and not work all the time. I don’t mean that your book is utopian or romantic in a dumb way — but it describes a different kind of scene than the one I see now for young writers and artists who are encouraged to buy themselves a couple years at very expensive MFA machines.
EM: I think it’s less geographical but that younger writers could probably think of coming to New York more actively as a collective project. Do people live together in big or small groups with the goal of working on their writing or art and NOT getting a job. I’d love to hear about that project. I’m sure it’s possible. If part of your ideal was witnessing your time and working in it instead of having to succumb to it I think a lot could be accomplished and differently. I wouldn’t like to live with people, though. I’m bent by the opportunity I had to get away from my suburban family and live mostly alone. Most of my friends lived alone, too. But our story isn’t the dominant one. Its fragility is probably there to be witnessed. I think that’s why I wrote that book.
What recent numbers analysis shows supposed sex parity, but also that the majority of people writing poetry are women?March 8th, 2011 at 10:03 pm
The sex parity was suggested in the vida pie-charts though yeah I remember a different result in the ones you produced. But I was responding to the ones I’d seen lately. I do mean in my experience everywhere I’ve taught the workshops are packed with women. Maybe that’s who takes my workshops but that’s the case at Naropa which is why I’d get enraged when some guy would get up and prop up the same old sexist world view to a tent full, largely, of young female students. Aren’t most writing programs getting most of their applications from women? Most of the graduate students in Missoula where I last taught, were female. I haven’t done research but this is what it seems to me. in the interview with Brandon I was thinking of many female driven scenes like the Belladonna one in New York which seems to be the dominant set in the poetry world I occupy here. Juliana and Dodie seem to be central figures in the Bay Area scene. Who are the big men?March 9th, 2011 at 5:10 pm
Oh. Thanks. Was wondering what studies. I’m not sure I would read the VIDA ones that way. Although I am going to go back and look. Wondering if one does a sort of VIDA count using a random sample on last year in “experimental” what happens. I would hope to be pleasantly surprised. I want “experimental” to be “better.” Not worse.
I agree with you. Belladonna is amazing! I wish I had Belladonna in my backyard. I say this all the time. Stopping self from writing long paragraph on how much I adore the multi-media/platformed approach of Belladonna. Books! Conferences! Reading series! Chapbooks! Etc!
And, although there are no #s on this, I suspect most MFA programs are more female than male. Perhaps way more. Ugh. MFA makes my brain hurt. If the MFA admitted its femaleness “at the true level of their productivity and influence poetry would wind up being a largely female world and the men would leave.” Or not get MFA. Is this one more of the many reasons everyone hate on the MFA so much?
Brandon is one of the big men in the Bay area! But also the obvs are Michael Palmer. Kit Robinson. Bob Haas. Dean Young. Alan Bernheimer. Joseph Lease. Stephen Ratcliffe. Etc. You know this list. Thank you though for asking “who are the big men?” Thank you for “Being Female.”March 10th, 2011 at 12:35 pm

Miami Beach Gay Pride Cruise Returns
Miami’s LGBT scene will be sizzling come spring. First up on the docket, the Miami Beach Pride, held on April 15 this year, will be bringing buzz back to the Deco District. Last year’s event saw 40,000 people march down Ocean Drive, making it the largest single-day event in South Beach’s history, and with the addition of the post-Pride party cruise, one of the most unique.
Setting sail Monday, April 16, through Friday, April 20, onboard Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Sky, the Miami Beach Pride Cruise offers a chance to extend the party with a 4-night voyage to the Bahamas with stops in Grand Bahamas, Nassau, and Great Stirrup Cay, the cruise line’s private island. A portion of the proceeds will be donated back to Miami Beach Gay Pride’s charitable causes..

Stumptown Comics Fest 2013
Not everyone can be a superb artist, but here at Sock Dreams, we are fortunate enough to have several seriously talented folks.
From the real to the absurd, from the geeky to the adorable, if you ask for invoice art, one of us is more than happy to oblige.
That’s why, when we were offered a table as the first non-comic retailer at Stumptown Comics Fest , taking place at the Oregon Convention Center this weekend April 27th & 28th, we knew that we had to present something pretty darn special.
Stumptown Comics has been celebrating independent comic artists, writers, and publishers for 8 years now and has grown exponentially. It is a gathering for all the geek community of Portland, with parties, performances, pod casts and the Stumptown Independent comics awards. Portland is a city of comics, with folks like Oni Press, Dark Horse, Periscope Studios and countless other comic folks doing it on their own and Stumptown is their time to shine.
When we learned the we were going to table at Stumptown, it only seemed natural to feature not only our amazing socks, but our artistic talents.
As such, we will be premiering our very first Zine!!! It will be filled with interesting artwork, inspired by our customers, from various invoices over the years and we’re pretty proud of it. You will be able to find the Zine at any of our geeky events this year and can pick one up for the low, low price of 7 bucks! In addition, we will have all the usual deals on our Dreamer Socks and Dreams Stockings, as well as fun socks for this artistic crowd.
Hope to see you there! to comment! »
Photo Phrenzy!
In addition to all the pictures we’ve been taking of this spring’s new items, we’ve been doing photo shoots all over town!
We got to hang out with the supremely rad folks over at Periscope Studio…
We were graced with a visit from a traveling Latanya, blogger extraordinaire behind Sprinkles and Booze…
We met a sweet calico with Meghan Sinott from Filmed By Bike…
Soon, we’ll be shooting the lovely Karol Collymore, newly-appointed head of the Equity Foundation, and her partner Shaley in their BRIDE Knee Highs…
If you’re local, be sure to pick up the Portland Mercury‘s annual Southeast Neighborhood Guide in May, and keep an eye out for our socks gallivanting around Sunnyside Piazza!
And we KNOW we’re going to have a blast snapping pictures of the devastating derby dames of RCR! We Dreamers love our derby girls almost as much as derby girls love socks…
Stay tuned!

Socks For: May!
May is a marvellous month, with Emeralds, Lily of the Valley and Taurus as its symbols. Bold, dainty and terribly stubborn; which is a pretty good description of how this month is turning out for us in Portland, with blasting hot days, delicately warm nights and a mind of its own regarding the weather!
All this sun and April’s showers have made our world bright and green (and brought some of those May flowers too!). Which makes May’s gemstone very appropriate. Emeralds are green beryl, ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, but always green! And though we use the word “emerald” on only a couple of green styles, we have quite a wide representation of greens!
Clockwise from top: Opaque Solid Nylon Trouser Socks, O Basics, Harajuku Scrunchy Socks, N40s, Socklings, Kimi Wool Blend OTKs.
May’s flower, the lily of the valley, is like the shy cousin of the flamboyant lilies that dominate bouquets and their little bell shapes could easily be confused for any other sleepy-looking wildflower. The fleur-de-lis, on the other hand, is very recognisable. So we’ll let this stylised lily take center stage.
• Paris Trouser Socks •
• Snappy Fleur-de-Lis Garters •
• Paris Fleur-de-Lis Pantyhose •
Like Aries last month, the May’s constellation of Taurus isn’t as dignified in sock form as it is in star form. But dang is it adorable! Both of these cow socks even have grippy bottoms to help keep you stable.
• Moo Toes •
• Tubular Cow Socks •
As May moves on, spring will soon be over and, on the flip side, winter is coming for folks in the Southern hemisphere. So embrace these transitional days of spring and autumn while you can!

Socks For: April!
I will admit that I’m a little partial to April’s symbols, but for good reason—it’s my birth month! Sparkling diamonds, pretty little sweet peas, daisies, and Aries, April has got a pretty good batch.
Diamonds are, according to popular song, a girl’s best friend, but they’re also clear so they’re not easily represented via sock. If only there was a pattern or something that was diamond-y . . .
• Diamond Jester Knee Highs •
• Dreamer Harlequin Diamond OTKs •
• Harlequin Diamond & Stripe Tights •
Right! “Diamond” is a pattern/texture you can check off in our Advanced Search. It’s a gorgeous, simple pattern that goes with everything, kind of like the gemstone, even.
Top row, from left: Diamants Lace Topped Knee High, Sheer Pattern Knee High, Vienna Trouser Socks.
Bottom row, from left: Sheer Pattern Crew, Five Toed Sheer Knee High, B.Ella Gigia Microfiber Crew.
Sweet peas are pretty little pastel flowers. They have a distinct shape and don’t seem to be a popular choice to decorate socks with. Daisies too! Other than the flowers the Sock It To Me Elephants are holding, there isn’t single daisy on the socks we currently carry. I suppose I’ll just have to make my own. Let’s see, we need some solid white styles for the outside and some solid yellow for the middle:
Clockwise from top: Bobby Socklings, Ribbed M Stockings, Socklings, Opaque Thigh High with Bows, Taller Tabis, Harajuku Arm Warmers.
Center: Arm Warmer w/Thumb.
Did you know the daisy is a compound flower? Each petal and each cluster of yellow in the middle is an individual flower. Nature! So crazy and awesome.
The constellation that makes up most of April is Aries, the ram. I know the ram is kind of like, this noble symbol, but even the most dignified ram is still as fluffy as the sheep on the Sleepy Sheep bedsocks (though I’m sure the facial expression would be more stern). Sheep provide a lot of wonderful wool, with merino being a popular choice when luxurious softness is sought. We have a nice selection of merino styles to pamper your toes, but here are a couple that I consider the fluffiest, thanks to the amazing combo of soft wool and boucle yarn:
• B.Ella Katy Striped Wool Socks •
• Alpino Merino Mousse Crew •
• Franco Wool Boucle Stripe Midcalf •
April! Fluffy flowers, sparkling sheep! Spring all of its wackiness in full force.

Gumball Poodle: Dress vs. Athletic
Ever popular, Gumball Poodle’s made in the USA “word socks” are a fun way to label and proclaim. We’ve totally done a style spotlight on them before, but with the introduction of their crew style, they’ve now got three great ways to say it with socks. Wait, three?! That’s right, all the Gumball Poodle knee highs aren’t created equal and there are two distinctly different ways you can wear a word.
One style Gumball Poodle calls “dress socks.” You can spot ‘em by their contrast heel and toe. Smooth textured and thin enough for snugger shoes, they’re perfect at hiding under office slacks, looking like a plain dress sock at the ankle while secretly being like, a ninja.
The other style is called an “athletic sock.” True to its name, this style is rugged and ready for anything. A terry lined foot cushions and absorbs—in the copy for the athletic styles we even say “Keep in mind that they are SO cushy they bring your shoe size up by half a size, so they’re best for roomier sneaks and boots.” Their lightly ribbed body is a pro at staying up, they’re no sissies.
Beyond just style, the differences between the dress and athletic socks affect the fit. The dress socks don’t stay up as well on some legs as the athletic socks and there is no way the athletic socks are fitting into snug dress shoes. But with over forty words and phrases to choose from we know you’ll find a fit that strikes your fancy and says exactly what you mean.

Socks For: March!
Folks say that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb, and maybe that’s why it has two birthstones, Aquamarine and Bloodstone. The daffodil and Pisces round out the other symbols for March.
The aptly named “water of the sea” Aquamarine is turquoise beryl (its deeper green cousins are emeralds!). Now, we’ve got a lot of things that are turquoise, it’s a very popular colour (although, I will confess, it’s a real bear to colour correct!)
Clockwise from top: Opaque Solid Nylon Trouser Socks, Nuova Baby Ribbed Wool Socks, Harajuku Arm Warmer, Classic ToeToe Socks, Harajuku Scrunchy Socks, Layered Tulle Petticoat.
But March gets two birthstones! The second is Bloodstone, also known as Heliotrope, even though it is totally a different colour than the Heliotrope flower. Deep, dark green with flecks of red, it’s sort of the perfect counterpoint to the clear blues of Aquamarine. Green and red don’t appear together on socks very often, but I think we can capture the ideals of Bloodstone pretty easily.
• Dreamy Striped Tubes •
• New Zealand Bedsocks with Stripes •
• N Stripes •
I always forget that March’s flower, the Daffodil, is properly called the Narcissus. Frilly and yellow and already flowering in my yard, they’re harbingers of spring, reminding us that sun is around the corner. I was a little worried about picking styles to represent these flowers. Yellow, despite the recent popularity of mustard as a colour, isn’t a common shade of sock, but lo and behold I found a couple of shots where we used the Narcissus to bring out the best of lemony shades!
• White Knees •
• Sock It To Me Bumble Bees •
• Vertically Inclined Knee Highs •
Properly following February’s Aquarius sign, March’s constellation is mostly Pisces, symbolised by two fish. And we’ve got two-by-two options for you, both straight up fish:
• Sock It To Me Koi Fish •
• Mouthy Fish 3-D Socks •
And more symbolic scales (maybe your feet are the fish!):
• Lola Knee High •
• Mermaid Armor Over the Knee •
March marches on, bringing us the start of spring and sneak peeks of sunshine. Are you a March birthday? Do you pick Aquamarine or Bloodstone?

Whenever a business owner or company decides to make a website for their business promotion the first and foremost thing is to get it designed by a New York web designer. Building a website is like taking a first step towards increasing your popularity and revenue. Next important decision that you have to take is about web hosting, whether you would use free hosting services or get it from a paid service provider.
The term web hosting refers to the physical place where the site files would be located. In case of free web hosting the files are kept along with free hosting sites which make your files vulnerable to their control. If you choose a self-hosted blog, it implies that you pay certain amount of money for keeping the site files where you have more control over them.
Using and getting free hosting websites are much easier but on other hand getting self-hosted blog is also easy job. There are some disadvantages of using free web hosting plan.
The initial problem faced in free hosting is, you don’t get the advantage of selecting domain name of your choice. For instance if your business name is XYZ the URL would not be XYZ.com bit XYZ.blogspot.com. This makes the people hard to recall your URL. Also if you don’t have your exclusive domain name, people may conclude that you are new to the field and is not very keen about the business.
Another major problem with the free web hosting services is you get only fixed number or limited designing options to choose from. The designs and colors are few from which you have to select. So their would be no exclusiveness about your web design.
If you choose self-hosted option, than you get hundreds and thousands of options to choose from. The theme selection also has many options which can change the way your site looks and the color options are also plenty in number. This is just starting point. After fixing the website theme you can further customize the look of the website and feel of the site too.
As far as customization of the site is concerned, self-hosted sites stand better chances of getting it designed in the way you want. The overall functionality of your website can be improves by thousands of plug-ins available. Such thing can improve overall search engine optimization and the layout can also be designed according to one’s like. But such options and freedom are not available with the free hosting services.

The Splitweet support email receives every day a lot of comments, suggestions, good words (and bad ones) from registered and not yet registered users. From people who don't know how to browse the page to experts who suggest brilliant ideas.
What I want to show here is the list of the most (not necessarily the nicer) requested features that I've found in the inbox several times, so users say...
I want...
- To filter following tweets by account
- A desktop application like Tweetdeck
- A translation in my speaking language
- An application for my iPhone
- An application for Blackberry (the word Storm was heard a lot)
- TinyURL, is.gd, xortr.com and similar link integration
- Exclude my own tweets from the brands' mentions
- To pick the color associated to each account
- An application for Windows Mobile
- Search box for users
- To see new following users
- To schedule tweets
- To show nested conversations (and other similar stuff)
- A Firefox sidebar
- To post via SMS
We won't do everything on the list, at least in short. I want to remark that we are not a company and that we do all this in our spare time, so the development is slow. And, NO we can't promise you a specific date. We do our best, and we are also open to anyone who might help us, specially in the Adobe AIR development, firefox plugin development and translations. The first 3 points in the list are started :)
We also did a lot of stuff based on this kind of comments, just to put ten:
- Enable/disable sound preference
- Show complete name or username preference
- Disable autoupdates preference
- Redesign of the site
- Retweet messages
- Reply messages
- Check the last used account so you can post several times using the same selection
- Stop reloading page if there are new tweets and you are writing something
- Add to favorites and the favorites page
- Warn the user by javascript if no account is selected
And of course Splitweet is now in 11 languages...
I'm dying for a desktop version for OS X, or a pop out version of some sort that makes it easier to leave Splitweet running in the background. Any idea what the ETA is on something like that?
Keep up the good work guys. We all appreciate the work you're doing to provide this free service!
A desktop version that runs on OS X 10.4 & doesn't require AdobeAir!
My biggest frustration is being taken back to the dashboard after I reply to a comment from my brands or replies list. I'd like to be returned to the page I reply from. Also, why the three page limit on followed tweets?
Overall great job. I appreciate your efforts.
Hi Bob,
there is no 3 pages limit, but there is an algorithm that mixes all the followed accounts in a given date. Probably one account of yours has reached the last tweet and the others stop working, I should look at it. While reading this i was browsing splitweet.com/page/7 ...
Thank you :)
Click tracking and tweet scheduling. those are two features that another service has, but I still prefer the splitweet interface, so I haven't switched away yet.
I'll second the tinyurl integration and some type of follower management.
Those all might be "pro" features worth paying for too.
Being able to create groups for different types of accounts would be nice
Also to toggle which accounts to tweet to. (Select all, etc.).
Some sort of caching would help a little (maybe?), it seems to take a long time to move from tab to tab within the app and I think performance is more important than bells and whistles. I don't mind using tinyurl extension for example for FF and just do that manually so long as I dont ahve to wait 10 seconds for the page I requested to load. The client thing is cool but I don't care much for it since I use the 3 major OS' heavily and don't expect an app to work the same in all 3.
To simulte an app I would use a single site browser like Fluid or Chrome. But thats just my $.02. Thanks for putting this out anyway, you guys are doing awesome.
Hey Oscar,
There is caching right now, but probably expires before you click again. Think that users want to see FRESH content, that makes us to cache for 90 seconds or so.
If you have a lot of accounts then you have to wait for all the background twitter calls to create the dashboard. We could make the web fly, but it wouldn't be fresh...
You are right that sometimes in some cases the dashboard response is slow... we will have to look for a mid-term.
Thanks for your comments, and the sinle site browser is a good idea. :)
maybe have the brands show in individual sections : "brand 1" = "box 1" and so on (would make it easier if you have many brands)
I'm a brand new user to Splitweet (less than 24 hours) and I LOVE it! I manage 4 Twitter accounts and this has been very helpful to see them all in one place. I'm getting used to the color coding, too. It would really be cool to have the avatar instead of the color, but that's so minor.
I like it better than Tweetdeck (which really slows my computer down), but the only thing I miss is the ability to "Group" the people I am following so I can really keep up with certain people and not miss their tweets in all the traffic.
Keep up the great work! :-D
Carla
<!-- /*;} -->
I recently came across your blog and have been reading along. I thought I would leave my first comment. I don't know what to say except that I have enjoyed reading. Nice blog. I will keep visiting this blog very often.
Is there a way for Splitweet to automatically know which account I want to respond from? For example, if I click on a tweet to reply I won't always know which acount they are listed with so how do I know which one to reply from?
By now Splitweet remembers your last used account(s). It doesn't matter what are you doing, it just remembers your last selection and assumes you want to reply/retweet/tweet with it.
A major feature that would really be useful would be to have the ability to cluster / group selectable twitter accounts together in to a catagory.
This way when messages need to be sent out to say just "Europe" twittter accounts then all you would need to do is select that catagory "Europe" and your tweet would be sent to all those twitter user accounts. It can be used in other ways too.
This would make life easier than having to select each user from your twitter accounts check box to send tweets out to if you have lots of accounts!
N.
Number 6 would be great. Integrate a solution to shortening URLs. This forces me back to TweetDeck.
For me, the only thing missing from Splitweet is the URL shortening. I prefer tr.im.
Thanks for the service and all the work you do.
I'd like to be able to block people. At the moment I can follow/unfollow but there doesn't appear to be a block option. Some people who follow me I really don't want showing up on my followers list.
Seems like you could kill a few birds with one stone using Adobe Air.
Hey i love the site, i use it every day and it's brilliant, so cheers! the only time i switch back to the normal site is when i have to block/remove people.
So thanks very much and keep up the great work! for your wonderful service. Most of the time, internet activities consume an unbelievable amount of our time. This service helps to save lots of precious time. Please keep up the good work.
Hats off for a geat service, website and keep up the good work.
Great site but it'd be even better if brand mentions didn't include your own accounts. It is hard to filter through and find actual mentions if you are managing many accounts that follow each other.
Please consider implementing this change soon! Thanks :]
Hey whatever language splitweet uses, I will code the "brand mentions shouldn't include one's own tweets" for you, free of charge. I want it so badly :(
how can I retweet mssgs from splitweet ??
To retweet click on the "recycle" icon when the mouse is over a tweet.
Great site but it'd be even better if brand mentions didn't include your own accounts.
It is fast and easy to use. Occasionally I need to schedule tweets, so for that I use another service, but I prefer Splitweet otherwise..

| More 911 Madness » other Clear Channel stations. Sayeth the website:.
Except for the line about "big name personalities" (I mean, who are they supposed to be pining for? Dick Clark? Alan Freed?) it's not bad, huh?
The station was outed by someone at WOXY, who looked up the Radio Free domain name and saw that it was owned by Clear Channel in San Antonio.
I supposed this isn't all that surprising coming from the company that pioneered the art of making generic, nationally produced newscasts sound as if they're local. Still, it's hard to believe that upper management would have their heads so far up their asses as to think this is a good idea. Chances are they plan on using this "guerilla" marketing to convert one of their stations to a new "alternative" or liberal talk format, but all it's really going to do is piss people off.
Anyway, I think of all this as good news: Clear Channel is so desperate to defend its turf that it'll even try joining the chorus of critics.
(Thanks, Sarah Riegel!)
Update: The RadioFreeOhio website is now just radio silence; nothing but a launch date and a promise of "revolution." But we've posted some text from the site here.
Update 5/30/05: Clear Channel acknowledges stunt. See this followup post.

It's ironic that fans of WOXY, a truly independent and innovative station was the first to discover that ClearChannel was trying to be hip and cool...
Posted by: Bryan-Mitchell Young | May 26, 2005 10:11:44 AM
They had a message board up. First people were calling them commies, then when they got outed people were posting angry responses. Sometime this morning (between 7:30 and 10:30 EST) they pulled the plug on the message board--I'm getting a 404.

Check your facts more carefully. WNIR is not a Clear Channel radio station. We're independently owned and proud of it, and we have nothing to do with the Radio Free Ohio fiasco.

lol, the website is changed now, it says nothing but wait til the 31st, anyone have it cached or archived? archive.org and google and yahoo cache dont have it
Posted by: comsn d | May 26, 2005 11:44:37 AM
Wait. When folks are claiming that this is "bleeding" into other broadcasts, do they mean that WNIR's signal has actually been interfered with by this operation? Or is it that this operation bought time on WNIR, (and was presumably given it by Clear Channel stations in the area).?

Well if I WAS going to make a truly pirate radio station, I wouldn't use my real identity in the DNS information of its website. It might even be a cute prank to enter the ownership details of the company I was lampooning...
Now FCC frequency license records, that would be a better indicator of who is what.

Everytime I have to drive past their offices (my in laws live in Stone Oak) I contemplate how awful life was before satellite radio. Then I realise radio isn't that great. Then I cry on the inside. Awhile ago San Antonio had hearings against clear channel's business here... I don't know what became of those.. What was i saying?

Not to be pimping for WOXY, but over in the thread I linked to before they found that the message board is still up, you just can't get to it from the main page. You can still post though. Some of us are having fun taunting them and seeing how long it will be before they delete those posts too.

Come now, my little anarchists. This sort of thing goes on all the time. It's not even a new tactic on the airwaves. They've been doing this in Houston and other markets, having their top 40 station trash-talk their Alternative station and vice-versa. It's a practice as old as corporate convergence itself. Most people honestly never catch on.
Maybe it's news that CC blew it by registering the domain in their own name, but they'll learn. They'll create a wholly-owned subsidiary with a grassroots-sounding name to do this sort of thing from now on. Then only the people with enough snap to look into the backgrounds of the companies will ever know -- and only then because they're probably investing.
Oh, and as for faking the DNS registration -- that'd have to be a thorough hack. The NS records point inside the Clear Channel domain, so even if all the contact info is bogus, Clear Channel's own DNS servers are authoritative for this. Still think it's an outside job?
Meanwhile, look who's generating the publicity on behalf of Clear Channel.
Brilliant!

I e-mailed the clear channel tech guy listed in the dns info and he e-mailed me back telling me to go to the clear channel website. e-mail him back again saying well radio free ohio isn't listed as a clear channel channel on that site what is the connection with clear channel. he hasn't responded to that. e-mailed the radio free dudes and they never returned the e-mail. the first thing that occured to me about the station was that this was some kids setting up a pirate station and then using clear channel's specs for their dns entry to hide themselves. however all evidence points to the contrary.

Radio sucks. Music sucks. Here in the DC market DC101 is on the verge of becoming a classic rock station; they've played House of Pain (Jump Around) at least 3x a day during the afternoons lately. Not to mention the inmitable Pearl Jam (why won't they die? Who does Eddie Vedder have pix of to blackmail?).
The reason for this is simple: there's no new music being produced that anyone will listen to (but what about mash-ups? Hah.)
The interesting thing with CC in this instance is the notion of the "pirate" station "bleeding" onto other stations. A CLEAR AND SERIOUS FCC VIOLATION. Their license can and will be pulled immediately if any evidence exists as to this. Anyone have a tape of these "pirates". Why not post a .wav file on some blogs, file a complaint with the FCC for frequency infringement, and finally put a rock in the eye of this 10-headed CC monster?
The bigger they are, the harder they fall....
Posted by: Recovering Music Listener | May 30, 2005 11:24:56 AM
Here's an idea--turn off the radio, get yourself an instrument, pick up a pen, and make your own music. Let's make art and music an activity again instead of a commodity that we are dependent on others to supply to us. It will be more meaningful to you because it's your personal expression. Then get together with your friends and show them what you did, and hear and see what they did.
We don't need this pre-fab junk which is just a platform for advertisers anyway. We need to express ourselves. Then all these creeps will have no advertising revenue, and their huge empire will collapse. Anything not based on quality collapses eventually.

For the Activists:
Also, to your list of people to complain to, please add Robert Levine of the New York Times, who reported the story yesterday. Actually, add his editor, who's job it is to pitch stories and hype them up so they get space and don't end up running on a HOLIDAY.
Let Levine and his editor know that they did a shoddy job of reporting what could have led to a discussion of important issues (such as Low Power FM, lack of local voices, the fact that CC could just pop up another station, but a real local broadcaster would have much more difficulty), that you are complaining to OTHER people, and that this "prank" as he called it, has not been laughed off by everyone. (From a journalist, this is how to make it 'newsworthy.')
You have to send these things soon, though. A newsroom has no memory until it's necessary.

I'm in the delivery business in Austin TX, so I spend a lot of hours driving around while listening to the radio.
So, last fall I noticed the dramatic format change on three FM stations I surf among on a daily basis. Overnight all three changed: 102.3 and 105.9 (Clear Channel) and 103.5 (Sinclair Broadcasting). Out went the "oldies" format that even went back to the 1950s when Rock n' Roll began, to be replaced with what all three stations started promoting as "old songs mixed with contemporary ones."
Hmmm, this should be interesting, I thought.
Then, I noticed something strange. All three statiions, as an example of contemporary R/R music started promoting ?Los Lonely Boys? ?"How far is Heaven?" (not certain if I've got this right, but you probably know the song). Pretty good song. No problem, right?
But then I began to wonder about all the Christian Rock songs that started showing up, especially on Clear Channel's FM 102.3.
Oh, I get it. Under the old format of "oldies," the Religious Reich couldn't get their religious fundamentalist rock played over the publicly-owned airwaves,...so they dumped the old format.
But I think the plot even goes deeper. Certain classic R/R songs from the past use religious terms in their lyrics. For example, the Doobie Brothers and "Jesus is just alright with me." Great song. But the DB's had other great songs, too. So why does this seem to be the only DB song that Clear Channel plays?
You do see where this is leading, don't you? Lowery Mays (Clear Channel) and Bob Sinclair (Sinclair Broadcasting) put their heads together, I believe, and decided to use their network of radio stations to Proselytize over the airwaves. Christian Rock is essentially a niche market, but da boys at CC and SB wanted to share their right-wing faith with everyone.
I noticed what they are doing, and I'm not at all interested in being proselytized by some religious nuts, especially two guys who pulled a "sneaky" on everyone. Even though they don't play continuous contemporary Christian Rock, I now find myself carefully listening to the lyrics of any song I've never heard before...then I change the radio channel if I start hearing certain religious fundamentalist lyrics.
However, I think it is time I looked into XM Radio or Sirius Satellite. This way I can listen to R/R hits without having to wonder if that Christian Rock crap is intermixed. Hopefully.
And the funny thing is, I'm a Christian, but not one of May's or Sinclair's types of Christians. Hey, I'm liberal and a child of the 60s.

Many of the things being discussed happen to deal with the fact that CC is taking the capitalist system and raming it up our... so i cant see how not taking a selfserving prank to promote yourself to eliminate other grassroots radio stations, thereby allowing a corporate monopoly to exsist, is unimportant. And you are obviously taking it seriously to take the time to comment/read/ whatever.

Hi Cristina,
Thank you for your comment. I believe you are referring to us, The Inn at Sugar Hollow Farm, but we are not in Farmington, we are a bit further west of Charlottesville, on Sugar Hollow Road, on the Moorman River, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge. I think you are the Cristina from Italy who has stayed with us. I hope so! I wish you were here now - the leaves are changing color, it feels like Fall and it is just so beautiful.

To Mayor Stephanie Miner and County Executive Joanie Mahoney: Welcoming the state fair and all of its visitors to Onondaga County could be compared to welcoming people into your home.
But look around the area surrounding the fairgrounds and the city of Syracuse. There is so much trash along the broken down, pot-hole and weed-filled roads it is ridiculous.
There is no excuse. Everything from blown tires to bags of trash and piles of last year's salt remnants and stones are strewn along the roadside.
There is always talk in the news of revitalizing Syracuse. How is that going to happen when the city and surrounding area is broken down and full of trash?
When visitors come to our home, it should be clean and welcoming.

Short answer– yes.
I just did a test that worked with three domains–
on domain A, I had an iframe pointing to a file on domain B. Domain B’s iframe was to: alert “location.href”, write it to the document, and then redirect the browser to domain C.
All tests worked.

A tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is an electronic system designed to monitor the air pressure inside the pneumatic tires on various types of vehicles. This system reports real-time tire pressure information to the driver of the vehicle, either via a gauge, a LED display or a warning light. Maintaining proper tire pressure is critical for driver safety as well as maximizing tire tread life.
In October 2000, United States legislation enacted the TREAD Act (Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation). This Act mandated the use of TPMS in all light motor vehicles (under 10,000 pounds), to help alert drivers to severe tire under-inflation. This act affects all light motor vehicles sold after September 1, 2007.
Although vehicle manufacturers are now required to install TPMS sensors in new vehicles, there has been some confusion on whether or not drivers are required to keep their TPMS active. Although most states have not mandated the TPMS remain active, there are at least four states that currently require vehicles manufactured after October 2007 to have properly functioning tire pressure monitoring systems. These states include Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia and verification of proper TPMS function is part of the annual vehicle inspection.
Take a look at "State TPMS Regulations" to help confirm restrictions in your area.

I arrived at Rarotonga airport at 2am, January 30th, having left Auckland at 9pm the same day. This was all due to the crossing of the international date line, meaning all the hours lost due to time changes as I've moved around the world were given to me in one go, so now instead of being in front of time in the UK, I'm now way behind! Interesting to have the same day twice- although I think I'll time it for my birthday in the future!
The first thing you notice about the Cook Islands is how quiet it is. The Islands have a population of 18,000 and spread out over 15 tiny islands spread out over an area the size of Western Europe and the pace of life is positively sedate.
I am staying on the largest of these islands, Rarotonga,- a volcanic island surrounded by an atoll reef. The vast majority of my time here has been spent at the beaches of this reef, occasionally snorkeling, bust mostly reading and sunning myself, getting the last bit of sun on my trip before I head to the winter of the Northern Hemisphere and my final leg across the United States. I've also hired out a moped for the week, allowing me to navigate my way around the orbital main road of the island and take in the many different villages en route.
I've been into town a couple of times, but the nightlife is as quiet as the rest of the island life, and all is closed by 12 most nights! The people here are incredibly friendly, as it is nowhere near as developed for tourists as other pacific islands such as Fiji, making tourists more of a novelty than a commodity.
Overall, it's been a fantastic place to recharge my batteries from the frantic pace at which I traveled New Zealand before I take in the equally frantic cities of San Francisco, Las Vegas and New York before my final flight home, now quite clearly on the horizon!
Roratonga
I visited Roratonga in Nov. 1991 for a week.
Your description sounds much like mine would have.
I signed up for everything they offered and loved it.
The Cultural Center, History Trip around the island,
scuba dived the wreck, flew to the northern island of
A......., rented a car and drove it on every inch of the island, bicycled to the Falls. It is still one of my favorite island memories. AND THE PEOPLE WERE WONDERFUL, FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL. One of the dancers from the 'show' picked me up and gave me a ride to the airport. A great peaceful place to visit. L.

But as I slowly defrosed and took in the quiet Carpinteria morning, I realised that it had been a great idea after all. The greyish-pink quality of the light at dawn and the crispness of the air really made me feel alive.
The waves shushed against the shore as we crossed a lone train track to reach the cliff overlooking the ocean. Beaches in this part of California are like no beaches I have ever seen. The sand has an almost coffee colour to it, and they are much rockier than I had imagined
A flock of pelicans glided by, caught in an updraft. Shane thought they were dirty - their feathers weren't the usual gleaming white we are used to.
Later after a quick breakfast of cereal and yoghurt (Mel was game enough to try the powdered-egg omeletes) we jumped back in the tank for the four hundred mile trip from Carpinteria to San Francisco. The plan was to take Highway One, a road we had been told was a lovely scenic trip.
Somehow the descriptions that friends had given us of this road had not done it justice. Not even slightly.
I'd been told that travelling from LA to San Francisco would feel like travelling to another country. What I hadn't planned on was the feeling of travelling through many on the road between the two cities.
The trip began as the urban sprawl gave way to farming land - acres and acres of crops like a patchwork across the ground, with the mountains in the background framing the picture. This gave way to fields of swaying green-gold grass, as we hit Highway One and the coast came into view once more. Even the coast seemed changed; fantastic craggy rock formations pierced the surface of the ocean like an old man's teeth.
We made our first stop at the Hearst Family State Park. The wind hadn't let up - if anything it had gotten stronger, whipping my hair into my face as we tried to pose for photos on the jetty. It was here we discovered the answer to the dirty pelicans - they're a whole different species - the Brown Pelican.
Zipping across the highway we made a little detour to Hearst Castle - the home of WR Hearst, a media magnate from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His Castle and grounds are said to be breathtaking in their magnificence. Unfortunately, we hadn't pre-booked a tour, and in the typical control-freak style of the American's, no one can access the castle or the grounds unless they are on a tour. The wait for an available tour would have made us so terribly late into San Fran that we were forced to leave empty handed.
The disappointment didn't last long, however, when we stumbled across the next stop on the highway - a viewing area for Elephant Seals who sun themselves on the beach. And before we even got near the seals I was fully distracted by another form of wildlife - a squirrel, begging for food. I desperately wanted to feed it, but the signs forbade it, and I had nothing to give in any case.
The seals were enormous, rolling about in the sand and flicking it over themselves while using as little energy as possible. The only real action we saw was when two larger ones started grunting and throwing themselves at each other - an obvious show of dominance.
What really left me speechless was the sheer numbr of seals on the beach - it seemed like almost every available bit of sand was taken up with at least one of the enormous creatures
After there the road really started to take some serious twists and turns, narrowing and winding around the steep cliffs overhanging the ocean. Bede was a very careful driver, taking the road slow and steady like the tortoise. Unlike Shane, the hare, who seemed to prefer to leave the car to pick its own speed, and at times I was clinging to the seat for dear life. He'll insist I was overreacting, but I'm sure I tasted my heart in my mouth at least once.
It seemed like every time we came around a bend we were gasping at the new beauty of the scenery. It never stopped being amazing how each turn revealed a sheer drop towards aqua ocean, cliffs covered with pine trees or enormous misshapen rocks.
We stopped for lunch at a little cafe very high above the ocean. As suspected the meals were enormous, but delicious. I think Man and Food might be even - the cool, salty air must have boosted Shane's appetite.
We weren't entirely through the windy part, but the road curved away from the ocean, and the landscape changed again. Forest suddenly soared up on either side of us, forming a break from the icy coastal wind, and overshadowing the road. We had entered Big Sur.
One thing I was dying to see was a Giant Sequoia - a Redwood. They are the tallest trees in the world, and only found in this part of the United States. While the best ones are hanging out with Yogi Bear at Yellowstone, according to the slightly creepy park attendant at Big Sur "there are some lovely specimens right here". Of course, I think his slightly confused tone of voice was in response to Shane's ambiguous and uber bogan greeting: "g'day mate, we wanna see some big trees". It's been Shane's goal to try and work up to using an Australian colloquialism like "flat out like a lizard drinking" or "dry as a dead dingo's donger" in a conversation with an American. He's not quite worked up the courage, but I think he's on his way.
The "specimens" we saw in the park weren't quite the giant ones, but they were still enormous and magnificent. Mel and I were like tiny munchkins trying in vain to get out arms all the way around one. Mel is used to being a munchkin, but it's not something I've ever really felt before..
Further into the park, we came across a little rocky stream. There was no question about whether I was taking a paddle or not. Icy cold outside it may have been, but that water was getting on my feet in one way or another.
The trees allowed a dappled light to penetrate and sparkle off the water (a bit like vampire skin, really). The water WAS freezing, but my feet were numb so quickly that I didn't mind. I waded around for about ten minutes with the boys. Mel decided her feet would stay dry, but she did find some tiny golden specks in the wet sand. Gold was a big contributor to the settlement of California, and so the specks could well have been tiny pieces of real gold.
We dried off and kept moving, still having a couple of hours until we would reach out accommodation in San Francisco. The road met up with the 101, and we were flying once more.
My first glimpse of the San Francisco I recognise was the steep rows of houses as the freeway closed in on the suburbs surrounding the city proper
Shane's first impression of San Fran was; "It's like Melbourne - it's cold, there're trams and lots of beggars". And he's quite right. In walking one block from the car to the hotel I was accosted by three different beggars - one cradling a scruffy looking dog with a sign against her knees reading "Please help us get out of the cold". It was almost heartbreaking.
It's definitely not a sleeping city though - it's almost midnight on a Sunday night as I write this and I can hear the street car (tram) clanging it's bell outside my hotel window. I'm looking forward to riding one of them tomorrow.
Our hotel is 'boutique' and had maintained an Art Deco charm. The features are very close to original, and the corridors are long and confusingly laid out, almost to the point where I'm starting to wonder if I turn a corner whether a pair of twins will appear asking me to come play with them...forever and ever and ever... But horror movie scenery aside, it's a stunning hotel, and definitely more unique than any modern behemoth.
Tomorrow we plan on hiring some bikes and taking a bit of a ride through the city. Maybe we'll catch the trolley car to the top of a hill and coast down...
I'm really enjoying the read each evening.
Loving your blogs :)
Ha, you should be a travel writer. Love the descriptions. Too bad it's still so cold though...

Where I stayed
-Lyndon B. Johnson
Wednesday's field trips were in the Hill Country. First stop: Fredericksburg, a town with much German influence, where we started with the Pacific War Museum. Most of us did a cursory walk-through but retired history professor Jack, of our group of friends, wanted to see (and read) it all! We walked, without Jack who was still in the museum, along Main Street checking out a few shops and even tasting some local wines. We decided to eat at Wheeler's Restaurant. John had German sausage which he said was OK, not great. I had a Reuben sandwich which was quite good. The six of us split up after lunch. John and I checked out Rustlin' Robs where there was a huge variety of salsas and sauces to taste. John discovered some hot ones! We shared a German sweet pretzel from the
bakery---very nice. The coach picked us up at 2 and we were headed to the LBJ complex.
The first stop was the Visitor Center where we viewed a film partly narrated by LBJ himself. We had a little while to browse the exhibits and gift shop. Our driver, Michael, then drove us around the ranch while we listened to an audio narration. We saw many cows ---with branded horns. There were a number of deer grazing as well.
We toured the Texas White House where there were park rangers in some of the rooms to relate stories about LBJ and Lady Bird. The last bus stop was the cemetery where the former president and first lady are buried.
After leaving the ranch, Michael took us on some very curvy roads to Luckenbach, which was a surprise as it was not on our itinerary. While we still didn't know where we were headed, Christina and Della played the Waylon Jennings song "Luckenbach, Texas" and then told us we would stop there for a cold one. As long-time country music fans, both John and I just had to get Tshirts and he chose a visor, too. It was a fun stop and a cool surprise! And, you know, "Everybody is somebody in Luckenbach!"
Click on the youtube link to hear the song. Just X out the advertising at the beginning.
Then we were "on the road again" to Waring and realized that these were the REALLY curvy roads! When we arrived at the Waring General Store, Bret Michael's tour bus was parked there. I took a picture for my daughter who was a big fan at one time. It was "steak night" and we ate outdoors on picnic tables. There was salad with Texas ranch dressing---spicy, chalupas, quesadillas, mashed potatoes, rolls and of course, steak! Not the best but OK. We had beer with our meals---definitely not a bad thing. There was live music but NOT country---go figure! (OMG, I just this minute had a revelation! It was likely Bret Michaels playing!) I was hoping to get John to dance but there wasn't even a dance floor!
We returned to the hotel about 8:30, pretty tired after another long, busy and fun day!

Honestly I am not cool with this!
haha, it apparently is coming, mm123, get ready!!!!
Cool! What an amazing time/world we are living in. This is going to be absolutely awesome!!!
Thx, justacooldudeuknow28, we hope so!!! There will probably be plenty of snags along the way, we’re interested to watch the whole story play out …
I think many of us are looking forward to the opportunities that driverless cars represent, and while the roads are getting their improvements it would be great to see other coexisting technologies introduced such as bimodal technology. More options are always better and how great would it be to have not just a car driving itself but a car driving itself a long a high speed efficient system that would allow more throughput and less congestion.
Thx BiModel Glideway — we also think that getting rid of rubber-necking and all of that highway congestion could be one of the biggest upsides!!! Just imagine … driving into Los Angeles without wanting to throw yourself out of the moving car!!!

When you say, Webroot users are protected from this treat, how do you mean? I don’t see email spam filter or protection in the Webroot SecureAnywhere Complete platform, and can’t locate where you offer antispam protection. Please advise, most of the Webroot threat blogs write about spam email but I can’t find it in my Webroot interface!
Thanks for the question, it’s a relevant one.
When I say that Webroot users are protected from these threats I have multiple things on the mind. For instance:
- on the majority of occasions the malware samples dropped in these campaigns following a successful exploitation of a client-site vulnerability, are detected as already being a part of a malware family known and detected by Webroot SecureAnywhere Complete.
- Webroot’s built-in anti-client-side exploitation often prevents the actual client-side exploitation to take place on the affected host.
- Webroot’s built-in behavior-detection technology proactively detects the malicious intentions of the dropped executables, and prevents them from modifying and accessing critical system resources upon execution, thereby minimizing their impact on the operating system even if the user gets socially engineered to run these executables.
Hope this clarifies the “protected by Webroot” line.

New on WiserEarth: RSS Feeds from Search Results
If you’re not familiar with the term, RSS stands for stands for ‘Really Simple Syndication’ – it’s a web feed format accepted by many websites such as Facebook and LinkedIn. On WiserEarth, the feed you create will update every time something new comes up that meets your search criteria. So say, for example, you searched for events in San Francisco. Now every time someone posts a new event in San Francisco on WiserEarth it will be ‘fed’ to you automatically.
So how do you create your personalized web feed? Just follow these three easy steps:
- Conduct a search on WiserEarth, you can use this link. Remember to put the words in quotes if you want to use an exact search term, e.g. “Transition Towns”.
- Click on the RSS icon or text on the top right-hand corner of the search results. It will look like this:
- You browser will open a new page with the Feed URL. Copy that link into your favorite RSS-enabled website or program.
Here are a couple of ideas for using your new RSS feed:
- Feed it into Facebook: Click on this link and insert the Search RSS URL. It’s as simple as that.
- Feed it into Twitter: Go to TwitterFeed, register, and click on ‘Create New Feed’.
- Add it to your RSS reader: Free services like Google Reader and Bloglines allow you to read all your RSS feeds in one place.
Give us your feedback as a comment below and let us know how you are using the new RSS Search feeds. We will share how you are using these feed in a future post.

It is my honor to introduce Lawrence De Voe as Yammer October Customer of the Month. As Chief Technology Catalyst at Initiative, Lawrence embodies the progressive technologist who understands that the role of IT is to make the organization more adaptable and innovative through the use of technology.
Apart from being a visionary, Lawrence is a valuable member of the Yammer customer community and a respected voice in the industry.
Here’s Lawrence’s experience in his own words:
When I joined Initiative, one of the first things I did was sit down with our CEO to discuss the state of the business and how we were using technology. We talked at length about the business strategy and what we needed to do with technology to further it. The clearest single message coming out of that meeting was that our business leaders around the world (we have offices in over 70 countries) found collaboration hard, and had very little visibility into what was happening in other parts of the network. We had an Intranet, but it was over engineered, widely disliked, out of date and difficult to use.
Over the next month I had my team identify and evaluate the key problems with the existing Intranet while I thought about the gaps between what it was and what the agency actually needed. Coming out of this assessment we had a problem – fixing the existing known problems with the Intranet was going to cost a lot, and even then we would be left with a system that didn’t align very well with the actual needs of the organization. I met again with the CEO, and proposed that we take the opportunity to try something different – a simpler and more social Intranet that would empower users across the network to collaborate and communicate in real time. He loved the idea, and after a few weeks of looking at different ways to accomplish this we decided to pilot Yammer.
The initial pilot user group was 10 users who were supposed to report back on what they thought at the end of 3 weeks. Instead, they invited their co-workers and at the end of 3 weeks we had 400 users signed up and actively using the toolset. People were emailing the CEO telling him how much they loved Yammer, and emailing me asking how they could get involved. We quickly moved from pilot mode to full on deployment planning, and now have 7500 people from 4 agency groups in our Yammer network. each of our networks has its own character from our Initiative network which is a pure Yammer network, to our UM network where Yammer is embedded in SharePoint. We also have numerous self-service external networks for clients and business partners being set up all the time. My favorite thing about Yammer is that it’s so empowering to our users. It’s let my team get out of routine provisioning discussions to focus on higher value activities.
And here’s a little more about Lawrence:
Thank you, Lawrence, for your vision and commitment to making Yammer successful at Initiative.!

Shannon, from the Zazzle Store wasootch, was kind enough to sit down and answer some questions about her hobbies and some great tips for new sellers. Check out the interview below and don’t forget to check out her store wasootch!
About: Why is the store named Wasootch? Well, it’s the name of a picnic area in Kananaskis Country, Canada and we’ve always found it to be quite a fun sounding word. Then, we looked up the meaning and found it is a Stoney Indian word meaning “unique”. We thought that had a nice ring to it. Finally, we started off with our cartoon Bigfoot products and thought that perhaps a Bigfoot type animal might be appropriately named a Wasootch. Lately we’ve been creating more wedding related designs, many of which we try to put some “uniqueness” into.
Zazzle: When and how did you first become interested in art? How long have you been making art?
Shannon: I’ve always been interested in art, even as a small child. Back then, I really liked cartoon art and would draw a lot of cute little characters. In elementary school, I enjoyed arts and crafts class the most out of all my classes. Once I reached high school, I made sure to fit many art and visual communication classes into my schedule. I actually thought I might become an animator professionally. Of course, thinking I couldn’t really make a living off of being an artist, I actually didn’t end up pursuing it as a career. I took Electronics and ended up in the computer industry for a quite a while. It was through this that I started doing web development, and the graphic design that went along with that. Eventually, it is this that led me to Zazzle, as it has always been the design work that I really enjoyed, rather than the web programming.
Zazzle: When you’re not creating art, what are your other hobbies?
Shannon: I have always loved trying all sorts of new things. Right now, I enjoy hiking, traveling, running, and reading. I’m also attempting to learn Spanish and I’m finding it quite challenging. Lately Zazzle keeps me quite busy. I might have to put more time aside for other interests!
Zazzle: What is your favorite Zazzle feature? How do you use it?
Shannon: This is a tough one, as I really like a lot of Zazzle features. As just one example, I like how easy it is to take an rss feed of any of the products from Zazzle and post them on a web page anywhere or import them into a database to be used on a web page. I’m currently working on creating a site on my own domain, so I will be using this feature a lot. Also, Zazzle store builder and many of the other promotional tools really help sellers get the word out as well. It’s really quite easy to post Zazzle products onto blogs and social networking sites using the tools available on the product pages.
Zazzle: Do you have any fun stories about being a seller on Zazzle?
Shannon: I would say the most fun I have is interacting with my customers when they have contacted me through my store on Zazzle. I’ve heard from customers all around the world and I’ve gotten to know some of them fairly well. Another fun part of being a seller on Zazzle is getting to tell people I often “make money when I’m sleeping”. Not many jobs where you can make that claim!
Zazzle: What got you interested in selling your art on Zazzle?
Shannon: Random luck I suppose. I was looking into ways people use the Internet to make money and found the print on demand world. I thought it might be fun to give it a try, as I felt it could be a good way to motivate me to learn Illustrator and Photoshop better and do something different in terms of design. It was really just an experiment. It has been fun for sure! I never actually thought I could make a living off of it, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised.
Zazzle: What tips can you give someone who is just starting out on Zazzle?
Shannon: This is a tough question, as everyone has their own goals with their Zazzle stores. One thing I will say is that it is not a get rich quick scheme. It takes a lot of work and you need to put in the effort to get results.
I’ll also say that, contrary to popular belief, success does not lie in putting up huge quantities of products. Wasootch was getting good sales without having very many products up. It is better to think about what designs you are putting up right from the beginning. There is a lot of competition out there. You need to think about how you can fill what a customer might need or want. Think: Is there a niche market that is not well represented in the Zazzle marketplace and elsewhere that you may be able to tune into?
You can get sales without doing much promotion, but it is important to have good titles, descriptions, and tags. Even the names of your images should be considered. I see many people use titles like “Whimsical Dream”. Well, that is a pretty and artistic title, but it’s not great in terms of helping people find your product. Titles that use design descriptive keywords work much better, like “Cute boy and dog walking in park customizable poster”.
Also, creating designs that fit the products properly is important in my opinion. A bumper sticker design should fill the full size of the bumper sticker. A round sticker should have a design that works with that shape properly.
Finally, adding template text is a good idea. What makes Zazzle special is the ability customers have to customize the products with their own names or text or pictures. Showing them samples of what they can do doesn’t hurt at all. That is something I wish I had learned earlier. I made a lot of products that weren’t really customizable. When customers are buying a shirt or invitation or whatever off of Zazzle, I suspect they want to add their own personal touch.
Thanks Shannon!

Received wisdom says that Ray Charles, who died in, his duets release on Concord Records coming out August 31.
Ray's voice wavers a bit from time to time and some of the high notes evade his grasp, but the conviviality of the collaborations bring out a spark in Ray that has often been buried under sugary arrangements in his later period. "Here We Go Again".
Bill Cosby will host a Ray Charles tribute concert Sept. 29 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel with Michael McDonald, James Ingram, Gerald Levert and Angie Stone thus far signed on to raise money for the $15 million Morehouse College Center for the Arts in Atlanta. Brother Ray gave the black liberal arts college $2 million to help fund the complex, which will contain a performance space in his name.

Hey Eric,
Have you heard the "Crazy Love" duet of Van the Man and Ray the Genius on the CD? That's the one I really want to hear.
I read that both of them were incredibly moved when they performed that song at a Songwriters Award ceremony last year.
2 - Eric Olsen
Yes, it's the last song on the CD and was recorded live, maybe at the show you're talking about. It's very nice.

Hey everyone,
I am starting a new blog and it will be all about blogging. I have great plans for this blog as I have been a blogger for about 4 years now.
4 or 5 months ago I was a victim of a hack and my web hosting provider was unable to restore my files and database because all along they were not backing up my files. SHAME ON THEM.
Anyway, to make a long story short I gave up for a few months and just 2 months ago I started back. This inspired me to start a new blog on this topic and to offer a blog hosting service to other bloggers. I am going to be teaching blogging as well as traffic and list building while offering great blog hosting services.
If you are interested in helping me out that would be great! It is a multi-author blog allowing others to share in the goal of helping other bloggers.
Please add me as a friend and send me a message. You can also reply to this post with your contact information such as email, Google+, or your blog. I will get in touch with you one of the ways you provide.
Thank you so much for considering. It will be a pleasure working with you.
Jonathan Smith
P.S. the blog name is HitBloggers. Not yet ready to go live with it as I just started it...BLAH :(

You Know You Have Boys When....
....your toyroom contains:
LOL, yes that is certainly an all boy playroom. We have some of those items but add to the mix dolls and dress ups. :)
Blessings,

Only 2 balls? Oh, and my toyroom mostly has pieces of all these toys, not the whole toy, because they have taken the toys apart!
lol Jenny!
Great post. Sounds like my house...and I only have one boy.
Most of the balls have migrated outside, now that it's nicer out. And -- they always have plenty of fun throwing the pillows!
Of course, I didn't look under the couch and chair. That's just too scary.?

Acrobat X Opens a New World of Document Collaboration and Innovation
Courtney Brigham exchange. Our customers tell us they spend too much time figuring out how to do their jobs. They regularly face the difficulties of keeping everyone on the same page. They struggle with a staggering volume of information and the negative effect it has on their work. They want to reduce the complexity. Yesterday’s tools and techniques no longer cut it if you want to move your business towards tomorrow.
In a recent study of enterprise collaboration techniques, the Gilbane Group said, “The document is becoming a parallel collaboration channel to the Web, a channel in which people not only create and consume ideas, but also interact around them, creating innovation and value.” Clearly, our expectations of what a document is and does are changing. Today’s documents need to be dynamic. They must have tools for collecting, sharing and aggregating feedback. They must be able to contain comprehensive content, from text and images to audio and video.
Documents need to be dynamic in every dimension: It’s not just about content, it’s also about context. The context in which we present information or the order in which it is viewed is as critical to the overall communication as the content itself. For example, when a sales presentation is sent to a customer that contains slides, a short video and an order form, how might we manage the process that the customer moves through the information so we can create the most impact and get the order? Think of an insurance company that can process video, images and forms to expedite a claim. Or similarly video, images and testimony in support of a case for law enforcement. Putting content into context not only adds clarity; it improves productivity as well because the information is more actionable. You can see powerful examples of PDF Portfolios here.
The new Acrobat X software family redefines how documents are managed and used, how they are perceived, and how dynamic they can be. And now, anyone with the free Adobe Reader X can join the review and feedback process—all with access to sticky notes and highlighting commenting tools, as well as full control and security.
We’ve introduced new Acrobat services today, as well. Adobe SendNow, a new document exchange service lets you send and receive large files and track them with proof of receipt, so you can avoid e-mail gateway issues, complicated FTP servers, or the costs of expensive overnight mail. The SendNow service will be available when Acrobat X ships. Adobe CreatePDF is a new document exchange service that will be available through the Adobe Reader X interface as well as through the browser and allows a user to quickly create a PDF online. The CreatePDF service will also be available when Adobe Acrobat X ships.
These days, the document is very much the proxy of its author. It represents what you do, how you do it and the value you deliver to your company, coworkers or partners. With Acrobat X, your documents can be virtually unconstrained, as dynamic as you need them to be, expressing the creativity and innovation that leads to greater productivity.
Welcome to the next generation of document collaboration. Be sure to check out our new web site for a sneak peak of Acrobat X. And don’t forget to sign up for a trial download notification so you can be one of the first to see how Acrobat X can dramatically improve the way you exchange and collaborate on documents.

Has MDI been restored? Thankfully I’m working for a company at the moment who have stayed on Acrobat 8, but I hope that we’ll be able to update without the huge loss of usability that forced SDI brought about.
MDI isn’t back. We’re still SDI. Please see the blog post on this topic here:
[...] and Reader software, today announced a new family of products, including Adobe Reader X and Acrobat X. This new series of software, which Adobe says will be available sometime in November, will [...]
I agree MDI is a must and was a stupid decision to remove it. I trust that employee has since been fired and is looking for a job in the 70s on his monochrome monitor.
Speaking for myself, two of the most valuables features missing in Acrobat 9 were:
1. Support for MDI (multiple documents in the same window). Nobody in Adobe reviews documents side by side?
2. Compare documents from Acrobat 8. The compare feature in Acrobat 9 is an absolute mess. Tracking changes for long documents full of text was incredibly tedious and complex in version 9.
Will these two features be back in Acrobat X? If not, I hope Adobe don’t start thinking in dropping menu bars and adding silly ribbons.
Can Acrobat X open multiple documents? Or should I continue with Acrobat 8?
So, it I understand that MDI is still not available and that I either have to stick with V8 or look for an alternative. It’s enormously tedious that design-decissions are being made by people who apparently never have to work seriously with their own software. Please look at other industries that thought they could decide what customers need and what happened to them.
Regards
MDI support is not available in Acrobat X as previously announced, please check out this past blog post that details it further:

After exhausting all other possibilities, Braves outfielder Matt Diaz is headed for surgery on his right thumb, which is expected to end his 2012 season.
Diaz said he had the decision confirmed Monday afternoon by Braves hand specialist Dr. Gary Lourie, who will perform the operation on Wednesday morning. Diaz would need two months to recover before he could swing a bat at full speed, so this effectively ends his season.
 operation Diaz has had on the same area in a little more than two years, both times to remove splinters he and his doctors believe he got after being stabbed by a palm frond clearing his yard in Lakeland, Fla. back in 2006.
Diaz has been on the disabled list since July 21st, after trying to play through pain for the better part of six weeks. An MRI revealed he still had two small foreign bodies in his thumb. The hope was that with rest and antibiotics, the inflammation would subside. Infection hasn’t been a problem, but it never stopped hurting.
“I can’t grip a bat,” Diaz said.
Diaz said he first found out he was likely headed for surgery last Wednesday. He and his wife Leslee got a babysitter for their three children in case he needed some time to work through the news.
“I felt it was going that way because it just wasn’t feeling good,” Diaz said. “Surprisingly a sense of peace overcame me and just kind of ‘At least we’re taking care of it.’”
Diaz said he’s confident that the surgery will take care of the problem this time, especially considering he’s not under the gun to get back before the season is out, like he was when he had his first operation in May of 2010. He also takes confidence, he said, because he came back and played 58 games that year and didn’t have a problem with it until it cropped up against this June.
 was hitting .222 with two home runs and 13 RBIs in 51 games this season for the Braves. He said he takes consolation in knowing his thumb worsened before the July 31 trade deadline, so the Braves could acquire right-handed hitting outfielder Reed Johnson from the Cubs.
“I’m glad I hurt it as bad as it did two or three weeks before the trade deadline,” Diaz said. “If I were going through this now and we didn’t get Reed Johnson and Tyler (Pastornicky) wasn’t doing so awesome off the bench, I’d feel more of a sense of almost guilt from not playing. But we’re set with the right-handed hitting outfielder in Reed Johnson who’s done it, been there, and Tyler has proven himself off the bench as an unbelievable young guy to be able to do that.”

Well he is making 2.5 million this season. If Diaz does come back it will have to be at a reduced price. Id give him a Minor League contract and give him a chance t mke the team in ST nex year. But my complaint is why isnt Reed Johnson and David Ross batting against left handed starters. The final game of the Mets and tonights game could have been changed with them in the line up. Also Uggla hasnt hit leftys all season.

Why wasn’t the problem taken care of in 2010 when he was disabled the first time. It is time to cut Diaz loose. He certainly isn’t and hasn’t earned his keep. Time to retire Diaz. He may be okay in our minor league system as a coach but as a player let someone else waste their money on him.

Is this the start of another August like last year? When this team faces left handed piching, Johnson, Ross needs to be in the lineup. Sit Uggla and move Prado to second. Come on Bobby Lite, Left Handed Pitching is shutting this team down. Poor Minor is getting no runs from this predominate lefty hitting line-up.

J-MAN, I absolutely agree w/ you on the match-ups. We will face 4 lefty pitchers in a row, Ross and Pastornicky and Johnson need some starts in there. Has Pastornicky progressed to where he can play LF? Could we start an OF w/ Pastornicky, Johnson, Prado, with Ross at C? I think so. Could help us win.

The Braves better just focus on the wild card spot now and do everything in their power to not choke that away again. It’s clearly obvious the Braves don’t have what it takes to win this division. They can’t possibly choke away the wild card with the addition of another spot, or could they? At this point I won’t be surprised either way.

That “not very good manager” has guided this Braves team to the fifth best record in MLB with the 16th highest payroll. Only two teams with higher payrolls have better records. If this were a business(which it is), management would be looking to promote him. Let’s not let facts get in the way of opinions.

Matt’s season was over when the Braves picked up Reed Johnson. Yeah, he could have came back in Sept but I doubt he would have seen much playing time. When he was in the zone he could swing a hot bat but when he wasn’t he looked bad and struck out too much to be an effective pinch hitter. He may get on with someone else next year as a bench player but his days of seeing 2.5 mil a season are over.

Tonight Hudson pitches. If Fredi follows his pattern of letting Ross catch Hudson then Ross will be in the lineup.

Kidding. Diaz is a class act who can rake lefties when healthy. He is a solid defensive outfielder and excellent baserunner, which the Braves obviously are not too concerned about. I hope he makes a full recovery and is given a shot in 2013 with ATL. MD, Reed Johnson make the OF/bench much deeper.
We already know Braves struggle against just about any LH pitcher, (except Johan Santana) and need that RH stick for PH and platoon work.

Not that I’m disagreeing with you about fan is Wis but the Braves did resign Jack Wilson during the off season, 1mil for 1 year. He was granted free agency in Oct and the Braves resigned him in Jan. Jack is another player like Diaz who won’t be around anymore after this season and could possibly be given his out right release once healthy. I see Paul Janish being the Braves back-up infielder for the next couple of years.

My hope is the surgery works and the Braves give Diaz a chance to earn a roster spot next year. Someone who can fill in and pinch hit is always valuable. He knows there are no guarantees but that’s the way he has lived most of his career.
Best of luck with the surgery and get well soon.

Diaz’s problem with his thumb should have been taken care of last year or at least the first of this year. If you have a bad thumb, you can not grip the bat-thus you can not hit. Why do players continue to play hurt and why do stupid managers keep trying to play injured players. It never works out for the good–except for Kirk Gibson. Braves brought B-Mac back early last year and lost a chance for the playoffs because he could not swing the bat–doing the same thing with this year with his shoulder problem. A healthy Ross is much better than an injured B-Mac.

The Titans built a 21-0 halftime lead on the strength of touchdown runs from McManus, Milton Shelton (40 yards) and Tim Mertz (9 yards). The defense intercepted three passes to dash any hopes of a Decatur comeback.
St. Pius did not play on Friday. Coach Paul Standard’s team returns to action on Friday against Cedar Grove.
Here’s what else we learned on Friday night:
Robinson sparks Peach win: No. 1-ranked Peach County (6-0) needed a couple of fourth-quarter scores to put away pesky Jackson, 34-13. The Red Devils closed the lead to 21-13 in the fourth quarter. Peach County quarterback Greg Williams completed 11 of 22 passes for 220 yards and four touchdowns, three of the scores going to all-state receiver DeMarcus Robinson on plays of 34, 4 and 16 yards. Williams also hooked up with Malcom Colvin for a 47-yard touchdown. Keyshawn Lowe was a workhorse, running 27 times for 199 yards. Jackson tailback Derrick Bell rushed for 113 yards and threw a 28-yard touchdown pass.
Buford’s shutout streak ends: No. 4-ranked Buford (5-1) had its three-game shutout streak end, but had little trouble with White County, winning 49-14 in Cleveland. Buford had 443 yards of offense, with 358 coming on the ground. Running back Dontravious Wilson scored two touchdowns in the first half for Buford; he rushed 18 times for 212 yards.
Quarterback Will Brock scored touchdowns on carries of 4 and 31 yards for the Warriors (4-2), who scored the second-most points against Buford this season.
No rust for Carver: Taking a week off didn’t slow Carver Columbus. The Tigers put a 47-0 thumping on Henry County on Friday, their third straight win and second shutout of the season. Brandon Thoms scored on runs of 23 and 17 yards and quarterback Torrance McGee threw a 34-yard TD pass to Dreilon Freeman and ran for a 39-yard score. Carver isn’t likely to be tested until its Nov. 2 game at Peach County
North Oconee perseveres in win: The No. 9 Titans outscored Franklin County 14-0 in the second half to break open a close game and score a 28-13 win. It was the fifth straight victory for North Oconee (5-1), which faces a showdown against No. 10 Elbert County next week.
Woodward is unleashed: Woodward Academy, ranked as high as ninth this season, piled it on hapless Towers 62-6. The War Eagles (5-2) got touchdowns from eight different players and a pair of field goals from Alex Robinson. Quarterback Terry Googer had a pair of touchdown passes to lead the Woodward offense and Benji Russell and Marcus Hyatt sparked the defense by returning an interception for a touchdown.
Callaway wins Region 4 showdown: The unranked Cavaliers came from behind to beat Central Carroll 14-10 and put themselves in the driver’s seat in Region 4-AAA. The winning score came on a 68-yard drive that was capped by a 1-yard scoring run by quarterback Tez Parks. Two defensive plays were crucial to Callaway’s win; Terry Godwin scored on a 65-yard interception return and Wilson Lindsey sealed the victory with an interception in the closing minutes.

BT has a chance to win the region. There is no question that we are a senior laden team with the right pieces in place. The only thing that concerns me is that while we won Friday against a very young Decatur Team, they really dominated our line of scrimmage the second half. Nobody has ran on us like they did that second half. Decatur will be a scary team next year. I think if we can continue to play balanced ok offense there is no question we can win this region but it starts up front! Go BT!! Class of 2005

<|endofexample|>
ATHENS – Three days before Georgia’s opening football game, coach Mark Richt still had no answer to the persistent question of whether an NCAA inquiry launched in July will affect the status of star wide receiver A.J. Green.
“Are you expecting A.J. to play Saturday?” Richt was asked at his post-practice media briefing Wednesday evening.
“A.J. Harmon? Yeah,” Richt replied, referring to a backup offensive lineman.
“Green,” the questioner corrected.
“You know I can’t talk about that,” Richt said. “It’s a good try, though. I just can’t talk. I don’t know the answer to anything other than I’m not supposed to talk about the situation. And I really don’t know.”
The NCAA informed Georgia in late July that it was launching an inquiry at the school -– part of a series of probes at multiple schools about football players’ dealings with agents. An e-mail from the NCAA to UGA stated that investigators planned to interview one Georgia player. Green has said that UGA officials asked him if he attended an agent-affiliated party in Miami and that he told them he did not.
Green repeatedly has declined comment, at Georgia’s instruction, about the NCAA matter. On Tuesday, Green was asked if he has any doubt he’ll be able to play Saturday despite the inquiry. He replied: “No. I don’t know. I can’t say anything.”
Green was the first of six players mentioned by Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo when he was asked after practice Wednesday what the Bulldogs’ receiver rotation will be in Saturday’s game against Louisiana-Lafayette.
The NCAA also has issued no rulings on agent-related inquiries at North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama.
Two players linked to the investigations, North Carolina defensive tackle Marvin Austin and South Carolina tight end Weslye Saunders, have been suspended from their teams’ opening games for what their coaches called “violation of team rules” unrelated to the NCAA probes.
A July e-mail from Marcus Wilson, the NCAA’s assistant director of agent, gambling and amateurism activities, to Eric Baumgartner, Georgia’s assistant athletic director for compliance, instructed Baumgartner to “refrain from disclosing the details of the investigation . . . [to] anyone except your athletic director and/or president” and to inform them “of the necessity of protecting the integrity of the investigation as well.”
The e-mail said the Georgia player would be interviewed “to determine his knowledge of or involvement in, directly or indirectly, any violations of NCAA legislation.”
++++++++++
Freshman Hutson Mason will play Saturday if Georgia uses a second quarterback against Louisiana-Lafayette.
“God forbid, [if] something happens to our starting quarterback Aaron Murray, Hutson would definitely play,” Richt said Wednesday night.
It’s not clear if Georgia would play Mason in the game without an injury to Murray.
“Hutson is the No. 2, and if the No. 2 goes in, it will be Hutson Mason,” Bobo said. “For me to sit here and say, ‘Hey, he’s going to play,’ I can’t. We got to play the game.”
Mason has worked throughout preseason practice as the No. 2 quarterback. Last season’s backup quarterback, Logan Gray, moved to wide receiver and missed much of preseason practice with a sprained ankle.
++++++++++
Branden Smith will open the season as Georgia’s No. 1 punt returner, Richt said.
Smith, a sophomore cornerback from Atlanta, welcomed the news.
“I’ve been wanting to play punt return ever since I got up here,” he said.
He said he takes a three-pronged approach to the job: “The No. 1 thing is catching the ball. No. 2 is holding on to the ball. And No. 3 is just do my thing. With my speed and the blocking up front, it should not be that hard.”
Carlton Thomas is Georgia’s No. 2 punt returner, Richt said.
++++++++++
When asked on the SEC coaches’ weekly teleconference Wednesday, Richt reiterated his belief that Georgia doesn’t need to play more than one BCS-level non-conference opponent per season.
“We’ve been doing it, but I don’t think we need to do it anymore, quite frankly,” Richt said. “And I don’t think anybody in the league needs to do it.”
Georgia’s non-conference schedule this year includes two games against BCS-level opponents: the annual game against Georgia Tech plus a trip to Colorado.
Richt rejected the idea that weak non-conference schedules could pose a public-relations problem for the SEC nationally.
“Let me ask you this: Who’s won the last, what, four national championships?” Richt said. “It’s been SEC teams. And I don’t think those teams have gone overboard on what they’re playing out of conference.”
ALSO: It’s showtime for Georgia’s new defense.

Did you read what I wrote. Where did I say they wouldn’t play each other. The problem is they play the last game against each other. If both teams have the champ game locked up when they meet, or one does, it makes the game meaningless since they will play again for it all in a week or two. It’s going to happen eventually and based on history, could happen quite often. They should play during the beginning or middle of the season like FSU Miami do.

Knowing more than most about AJ Green it would not surprise me with anything. Good guy and hard worker with an excellent talent but not bright. His nickname amongst all of his former high school teammates and all around Summerville was AJ “cant read” Green. He always hung around a bad crowd and wouldn’t be surprised if he has done anything stupid to hurt UGA. Have any of you even looked at his birthdate and realized that he was 20/21 years old as a true freshman at Georgia? That should tell you something…

Bottom line — we need a complete shake up in the coaching staff from the top down. It might take 2 to 3 years to realize the results — but we’ll be better off for it in the long run. Think of it this way — what high powered program would try to hire Richt right now — none.

There is absolutely NO DISCIPLINE on our team, both on and off the field. There never will be until Coach Richt makes these guys pay the consequences. This goes for players and coaches alike. If a player makes a mistake sit him down and play the second string until he knows you won’t tolerate medoicrity, if that doesn’t work dismiss him. If a coach can’t coach or call plays replace him.
I know there is pressure on the coach to win; however, more games will be won with discipline instead of ignoring problems.. Leadership is the art of influencing people toward the accomplishment of a common goal. Where is our leadership?

CMR kicks Baker off the the team for under age drinking. He did this because it was an opportunity to get rid of a player that wasn’t right for the new defense. Yet, AJ Green commits a worst transgression and CMR says he’s a good boy and can’t wait to get him back playing. This wishy washy stuff is what is wrong at UGA. Green got 4 games suspension by NCAA, now UGA should add 4 more. Now lets see if he leaves school early for the pros when he only gets too play a hand full of games. Pros will not draft him in first round as a junior and only playing a couple of games. He deserve it.

Baker was kicked off the team. I’m ok with that but why kick this kid off and not aj green and washaun ealey or others who have had dui’s and other alcohol related arrest. This season is lost so I believe kicking AJ Green off would be the right move. I still believe that AJ is dirty and knows exactly who he was dealing with when he sold that jersey. But as usual the no name guy pays the ultimate price while the star gets a slap on the wrist. Uneven discipline is pure cowardice.

Your post…
“Georgia’s #1 porblem is they make decisions based on hypotheticals instead of real world tests.
Example, Aaron Murray as QB over Logan Gray or Hutson Mason. Also, Joe Cox as QB was a poor decision last year.
These guys need an on the field try out, and the winner is the QB. That’s the only way to get that decision right.”
WTH does that gibberish even mean????
Murray won the job based on what the coaches observed of all of the QB’s. Why would they just hand him the job? He won out fair and square.
Murray is playing great, the team as a whole is having issues. Murray is posting good numbers. Imagine if the team was playing lights out. Imagine the #’s Murray would be putting up! A freshman playing in the SEC, on a team that can’t find their way out of a brown paper bag, while playing at a very high level in spite of all that’s NOT happening around him. Knock him? H3ll UGA doesn’t deserve him!

It’s a little hard to measure Murray’s value as a QB four games into his college career. He could end up average or he could end up great…unless you or SteveW have a magic crystal ball.

You “fans” amaze me. Prior to CMR’s arrival, UGA football had been nonexistant for 20+ years. He has won 2 SEC Championships and finished #2 as well. Exactly what benchmark are you dilusional fans using as a measuring stick? Your last SEC Championship was 1982 prior to his arrival. You guys always win the “this is the year” Preseason National Championship, but it is always self proclaimed. Face it, short of one outstanding running back in the early 80’s, you guys are mediocre. Be careful what you ask for, because most of the time, the grass is not greener…

One of the ‘Special Days’ at this year’s conference will focus on ‘High-Performance Low-Power Computing’ on March 20, an area that is bringing new challenges to the system design community. This Special Day will feature four sessions covering System approaches, IC Architecture approaches, Many-Core SoC approaches and Fabrication Technology approaches for Energy-Efficiency. I have been invited to deliver the keynote on Energy-Efficient Computing at 1:30pm.
I’m fortunate that my work at ARM and our heritage in low power, high performance – particularly in the mobile space, enables me to speak with a pretty long view of this subject.
Since the very first mobile computer, power efficiency has been a key measure for success. In today’s hyper-connected world, our need for performance is ever increasing, and the energy cost of performance has risen well beyond just the life of the battery in mobile devices. Energy efficiency is now the key driver across most consumer and enterprise products and has become the primary limit in the delivery of high performance. During my keynote I will consider the various power related limitations of compute while discovering how the techniques and new capabilities introduced into mobile computing also bring the flexibility to address the limitations of the traditional computing approach.
We can think of three key phases in this journey: (1) Phase One began in the 1990’s with single core designs, such as the ARM1176 CPU paired with a DSP such as the + TI C64x. (2) Phase Two saw the Multi-core cluster based designs like the ARM11 MPCore and the ARM CortexTM-A9 MPCore often used with specialist accelerators. (3) Phase Three is where we are now: Multi-cluster designs such as ARM big.LITTLETM processing technology with Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 processors and ARM MaliTM GP-GPU graphic acceleration. Big.LITTLE technology ensures application tasks are using the right processor for the right job, to produce 70% energy savings on common workloads.
What could become (4) Phase Four is where we are potentially heading: ‘Scalable Compute Units’ – a future towards which ARM has already laid the required IP tracks. This introduces a new way of understanding, and also driving energy efficiency, while supporting the software paradigms and models familiar to the software community.
To begin, we need to abstract the thought of building systems with single discrete CPUs and start thinking about ‘Units of Compute,’ each unit managed by one of today’s SMP operating system, operating within an partitioned coherent region of the globally shared memory map. It is then a question of how to use these compute units in a SoC and scale them into many-core systems. The size and capability of any specific compute unit is defined by the target market’s ability to utilize the SMP resources the unit defines, ranging from a single CPU core up to a multi-core, multi-cluster design with arrays of GP-GPU compute. Today such units can be constructed from a single Cortex-A5, through big.LITTLE with GP-GPU acceleration, to a 16-way Cortex-A57.
From this concept we consider the benefit from a common global address space across the whole system with a very scalable global cached communication path between compute nodes isolated from traditional bottlenecks to DDR & IO.
As the SMP operating system (OS) won’t scale as far as the hardware can, we can then consider how any access to remote regions could still provide coherent shared memory between compute units while keeping the central part of the OS tied to each compute unit’s local coherent region
Because of advances such as big.LITTLE processing we can now begin to view the CPU as no longer having a single pipeline, and think of it more in the domain of a single SMP OS’s ownership. This thinking will start to include other API abstracted processors and accelerators, such as ARM Mali GP-GPU through the architecture currently being defined with in the HSA consortium. As the complex of such compute sub-systems has increased, ARM has used this basis to develop what can now be viewed as Compute Units from a single CPUs through to multiple clusters of multi-core CPUs utilizing MPCore technology, with the system IP such as CoreLinkTM Cache Coherent technology (CCI-400, CCN-504) being used within the Compute Unit to scale the overall capability of the design.
ARM has also recently introduced the Cortex-A50 series of ARMv8 CPUs, extending the concept of the Compute Node to 64-bits which through the capabilities it enables through a common global address, enables the development of a unified architecture with which to build many-core systems from multiple compute units and as such to nurture the future of the ARM ecosystem.
These and other developments will continue to steer us towards the low power, high performance course that government, business and consumers all need to take for a sustainable and dynamic future.
John Goodacre, Director of Technology and Systems, ARM. John.

us meet up for lunch at a restaurant and sometimes keeping all the kids in the group happy and occupied proves to be a challenge. Upon my first quick glance at the Doodle Rolls, I was pretty sure these would be a big hit.
A Clever Product
The Doodle Rolls are pretty basic, but awfully clever. The plastic container holds a roll of paper in one compartment and crayons in another. It’s all inclusive – you hand your kid the package and there is everything he or she needs in order to get creative right away. I like how the package is set up, because the roll of paper can be perforated easily. This allows kids (or parents) to easily decide how much paper they want to use.
If you’re wondering how my kids reacted to these Doodle Rolls, I want you to picture a crowded casual dining restaurant. We had just gotten to the point to where the kids were getting restless but the adults were still trying to enjoy the meal when I pulled the two Doodle Rolls out of my purse. My daughter (who is a huge fan of anything crafty) squealed in delight and immediately went to work drawing with her friend. My son was skeptical at first until I showed him how the paper comes out in a long roll, and then he was sold. My son and his friend pulled out generous lengths of paper and together colored a story that had something to do with Star Wars, zombies, and horses.
The Doodle Roll Was a Big Hit
All the kids in attendance enjoyed these Doodle Rolls immensely. The parents were impressed too, but when it comes right down to it, I think the opinion of the kids is what really matters here. The age range of the kids with us at lunch were from around 4 years old up to 9 years old, and all of them had a great time with these kits (the suggested age range is 3+). I do wish I would have had access to Doodle Rolls back when my kids were younger; it would have been great to have one of these in my purse to whip out while sitting in waiting rooms or while grocery shopping.
If your young child enjoys doodling, there is an excellent chance that these Doodle Rolls will be a big hit.

We like holidays, not just for the obvious reasons–the days off from work and school, the food, the gatherings and celebratory mood–but also because we like to have a theme. A theme for how to dress, a theme for crafts, a theme for books, a theme for new things to learn about.
Seems like I’ve been especially aware of this since Sabrina began preschool and started bringing home themed songs and artwork. Then there are the themed school events. From the Halloween Parade to the Thanksgiving Gathering Feast to the Valentine’s Day sing along, it’s been a great flow of holiday themed fun for us pretty much since September.
But now, no theme. I realized this immediately after Easter when Sabrina asked me what was next. What do you mean, what’s next? Is it going to be Halloween now? she asked. No, I answered. Is it New Years, she asked eagerly. And suddenly I realized what she was getting at. What was our next theme, the subject we’d explore for a few weeks that would then culminate in some big food- and probably candy-filled day.
I mentally went through the calendar and realized there really was nothing on the horizon. Veteran’s Day? Hardly something a kid can get excited about. Memorial Day perhaps, but that’s still a stretch when it comes to holidays that are fun for kids. We do have 4th of July to look forward to, but school will be out so I’ll be on my own as far as exploring this holiday in craft and art and song form. I have to say, I’m feeling kind of liberated with this little break from holidays. Nothing to make a big deal about, no pressure to make anything memorable. But for Sabrina, it’s a different story.
Luckily for her, April is a huge birthday month in our family. We’ve got, in order: my Dad’s birthday, my sister’s birthday, Sabrina’s birthday, CC’s birthday (she’ll be ONE!), and finally my nephew Alex’s birthday on the 30th. So now Sabrina is really looking forward to “the birthday holidays” as she’s been calling the celebrations. Her art has been filled with cakes, candles and balloons, and even as I write I can hear her humming “Happy Birthday” in her bed.
So I’m curious, are you feeling a bit of holiday withdrawal or are you sighing with relief at the break?
Singing relief here!! Yeah for no plans! Yeah for at least a month before the next holiday. (Earth Day, May Day, Mother’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Father’s Day) I don’t ‘celebrate’ all of these, but just in case you need a theme I thought I would include them.
It felt strange having Easter so early. There really wasn’t time after St. Patrick’s Day to do much easter stuff, unless you skip St. Patrick’s day all together. My family always celebrates May Day (May 1st). We don’t do the may pole stuff, but we leave flowers on people’s doorsteps. Last year my girls were only 10 1/2 months (twins), but we still made flowers using handprints to give to the grandparents. This year I am not sure what we are going to do, but it will be fun and it will make some people feel good. If you were feeling really ambitious you could take flowers (real or made) to a local nursing home (maybe convince the preschool teacher to get the whole class involved).
We have a whole spat of April and May birthdays! So that’s our thing.
Don’t forget April Fool’s Day! You could check out some joke books (such as the Jokelopedia) or if your kids are older, like 4th or 5th grade, “Dogs Don’t Tell Jokes” is excellent. You can also celebrate with a cake topped with trick candles or by practicing fun magic tricks together!
Could you help me. The trick is to make sure you don’t die waiting for prosperity to come. Help me! I can not find sites on the: Small business innovation. I found only this – small business valuation. The small consumer avail securities hardly emphasize shot size opportunities into their tied products that seek a finance head of purely pulling widows and have just been known, small business. Small business, your concept combination can then visit your details to help and check you to be hourly in the available members of your professional note. Thanks for the help

Florida Employers Registered 69 Mass Layoffs in September, the Fourth-Most Nationwide
According to the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida accounted for 69 of 1,189 mass layoffs across the country, compared to 78 of the nation's 961 mass layoffs in August and 147 of the 2,176 layoffs nationwide in July.
Florida's mass layoffs -- which count as one employer laying off at least 50 workers -- were also the third-highest in the country in June and again the second-highest in the nation in May, according to the BLS.
Among the eight states and the District of Columbia in the South Atlantic census division, Florida accounted for nearly 37 percent of all mass layoffs.
This comes after last week's news out of the BLS, which was that Florida's unemployment rate decreased .1 percent to 10.6 percent in September after three months of no change, putting the state back to the same rate it was at in May.
Still, state officials are somehow optimistic about Florida's jobs scenario. After last week's announcement that the unemployment rate in the state dropped .1 percent, this was the reaction of Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Executive Director Doug Darling:
Today's numbers are a strong signal that Florida is doing the right things to rebound from difficult economic times. But our job is far from over with 977,000 residents unemployed. We must continue our efforts of coordinated economic development to create jobs and ensure our workforce is skilled and ready to be matched with employment opportunities.
California led the pack yet again in mass layoffs with 297, followed by Pennsylvania with 132 and New York with 91.
Most of the layoffs nationwide were in the manufacturing sector, according to the BLS.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance have kept decreasing in Florida, from more than 12,000 in July to just over 5,000 in August, now down to 4,538 for September.

Preface
The older is the death story. The church first preached Jesus’ death. ‘Ye do preach the Lord’s death until he come’, said St Paul near the year 50ad, in describing the marrow of the meaning of the meal, the Eucharist, at the heart of the community’s life. Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried: here we hear the older story, the death story. This older story, the account of the Crucifixion and the radiant apocalypse of resurrection to follow, is the church’s primal affirmation. Paul: ‘I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me, and the life I know live in the flesh I live by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, who loved me, and gave himself for me’.
The second story followed the first, though that seems odd to us today. Later, some decades later, the church began to convey not only the story of the cross and resurrection, but also the narrative of the incarnation and proclamation of Christ. This was the primitive church’s second story. Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary: here we hear the second oldest story, not of death but of life, not of cross but of cradle, not of suffering but of growing, not of example but of precept. John: ‘The Word became flesh and dwelt among us’. In this secondary affirmation, the church accounted for Jesus’ advent, his birth, his teaching and preaching and healing, his parables, his miracles, his family, his disciples, and his call to those who would hear, ‘follow though me’. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength. And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The whole law is here summarized”.
Now these two sibling stories have usually gotten along well, with the occasional familial rancor. You will notice that the second story is that of Advent, Christmas, Epiphany and Ordinary Time. You will notice that the first story is that of Ash Wednesday, Lent, Holy Week, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter. They are related but different stories. How they are related consumes two thousand years and the whole history of Christianity.
Some traditions and denominations within Christianity tend to favor the life story. Orthodox, some Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Quaker, Unitarian and various other Christians tend to know the second story better, and to sing the Carols of Christmas loudest. They tend to interpret the New Testament letters in light of the Gospels. They tend to interpret Holy Week in light of Epiphany.
Some traditions and denominations within Christianity tend to favor the death story. Lutheran, Calvinist, some Catholic, Presbyterian, Baptist and various other Christians tend to know the first story better, and to sing the hymns of Holy Week and Easter loudest. They tend to interpret the New Testament Gospels in light of the letters of Paul and others. They tend to interpret Christmas in light of Good Friday.
But you will ask for a synthesis. ‘Please, Dean Hill, is there no way to bring these two stories together? Is there not an apt balance between Bethlehem and Calvary, Nazareth and Golgotha? May we not find a suitable compromise? Must we ever be at daggers drawn, death vs life, one vs two, Novum Testamentum vs Jesus Seminar, Buttrick vs Craddock, Calvin vs Wesley? In the immortal sentence of Rodney King, Dean Hill, please, por favor, ‘CAN’T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG’?
No.
No. The answer to your heartfelt desire is: no. You will inevitably read one story by the light of the other. Or, at least, the LENTEN answer is no. Now. Now…Come back at Christmas and ask again THEN and you may find a more irenic, more life affirming, more pacific, more latitudinarian response! But you will need to stay around until December for that.
In any case, in this season of Lent, we are best advised to listen to the first story, the account of Jesus death, and to do so guided by Scripture, Tradition, and Reason, that is, by Exegesis, Exposition, and Application. A quintessential Lutheran, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, is here to help us.
Our Holy Gospel from John, chapter 3, takes us insot the heart of Lent, the heart of darkness, a prelude to Calvary. Nicodemus appears at night, trying to catch the spirit. His darkened, murky encounter with the Christ of God reminds us, as Bonhoeffer wrote, that ‘discipleship is more than what we can comprehend’. In that sense, discipleship comprehends us, grace comprehends us, Christ comprehends us, rather than the other way around.
Nicodemus is a ruler of Israel. He is a teacher and a religious leader. He has stayed by the mother tongue, the mother tradition, the mother religion. He has stayed in the womb. He has never left home. But you cannot become yourself if you never leave home. To become who you are you have to go somewhere else. Not always geographically. Jesus never traveled more than fifty miles from Bethlehem.
John is concerned with Spirit, not speculation; with the artistry of the everyday, not with Armageddon; with the church, not with calamity.
You have already learned the heart of this text: that Nicodemus and Jesus are representative types of religion—past and future, law and liberty; that the word for Spirit and wind is the same word and that John can and does mean both; that the command to be born from above is plural, you all, or as they say in the South, “all y’all.”
John turns his gaze now away from inherited religion to focus on culture, away from Judaism to address the Gnostics, who wanted fervently to be saved by knowing “whence we come and whither we are going.” Says Jesus, “The Spirit blows where it wills.”
Cultural religion says, “You know whence you came.” Spirit says, “You do not.”
A pre-Christian culture says, “You know where you are going.” John says, “Not so: Those who are born of the spirit, of them you do not know whence or whither.”
John’s neighbors affirm: we know whence and whither. John replies: not so of those born of the spirit. You are left with confusing liberty, the assorted decisions of a complex life. You are free. In Christ, you are set free. In Spirit, you do not know. In Spirit, you believe.
Here stands Nicodemus, a man in full. A religious leader, really a representative of the best in spiritual inheritance. He ventures out at night, choking from the challenge of truth, new truth, full truth. Where he has been will not take him where he needs to go. He is a person on the edge of a great dislocation: he is about to make up his mind to change his mind about something that really matters. Think of Bonhoeffer in 1944.
Some years ago the Christian Century ran a series of articles by nominally great religious leaders, titled “How My Mind Has Changed”. A disappointing series. One found really little significant change of mind in any of them. Typical of preachers—stubborn, self-assured; it takes one to know one.
But here stands Nicodemus, a courageous soul. He is facing the great heartache of maturity. You face it too. He is facing out over a great ravine, a great gorge,
a great precipice. On a matter of mortal meaning, he is making up his mind whether to change his mind. That takes real courage.
Benjamin Franklin found this courage when he left behind his beloved Europe and his confidence in diplomacy to take up arms with his fellow colonists. Abraham Lincoln found this courage when he finally moved to side fully with the abolitionists. Robert F. Kennedy, then the junior Senator from the Empire State, found this same courage when he left the Cold War mind of his own past and of his dear brother to oppose the war in Vietnam. Sometimes you get to a point where you have to make up your mind whether to change your mind. To face facts, as Nicodemus courageously faced the works, signs, deeds of Jesus the Christ. It takes great courage to change your mind about something of mortal significance. In fact, it may not even be humanly possible, apart from grace.
It means admitting error. We would sooner be proven sinful than stupid. John takes us to higher ground. We have an easier time receiving forgiveness for sin than we do receiving grace for change. So, we hear John 3, the first of our three Lenten tasks in these weeks of Lent 2011. For our rendering of, our exposition of, the Gospel, we turn to the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born in Breslau Germany, in 1906. His father was a prominent psychiatrist, and the family sooned moved to Berlin. Bonhoeffer made, for his family, the unusual decision to study theology, and began in Tubingen in 1923. In the next several years, he wrote and published, and traveled to Barcelona and New York. He later served as a pastor in London, and returned for further study to NYC, again at Union Seminary. In 1934 he worked to organize the Confessing Church, which criticized the Lutheran church’s support of Hitler. For three years, he led a small seminary for the Confessing Church, in Finkenwalde, until it was closed by the Gestapo (about the time his book, the Cost of Discipleship, was published in 1937). Although on returning to Union in NYC in 1939 he could have stayed there, he determined to return to his homeland. In 1940 he was prohibited from public speaking in Germany. For many years he had taught and practiced a kind of pacifism. But in 1943 he began to take part in a plot to kill Hitler, for which activity he would lose his life. He was also engaged to married that year, and then imprisoned in Berlin. In 1945 he was moved from Berlin to Regensburg and from Regensburg to Flossenburg where he was hung on April 9, days before he would have been liberated.
Bonhoeffer is best known for his ferocious assault on cheap grace. We here at Marsh Chapel in Lent 2011 will not let his voice be forgotten. Hear him again:
Cheap grace is the deadly enemy of our church. We are fighting today for costly grace.
Cheap grace means grace sold on the market like cheap wares. The sacraments, the forgiveness of sin, and the consolation of religion are thrown away at cut prices.
Cheap grace means grace as a doctrine, a principle, a system. It means foregiveness of sins proclaimed as a general truth, the love of God taught as the Christian ‘conception’ of GodIn such a church foregiveness without requiring repentance, baptism withouth he has. Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock. It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life. Costly grace is the sanctuary of God; it has to be protected from the world and not thrown to the dogs…it comes as a word of foregiveness to the broken spirit and the contrite heart.
Do we realize that this cheap grace has turned back upon us like a boomer.
With us it has been abundantly proved that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generations. Cheap grace has turned out to be utterly merciless to our Church.
We set ourselves these weeks a third assignment, to apply the Gospel and this one life. As Justice Holmes said of a sermon he heard (5 beautiful words): ‘I applied it to myself’.
Monday morning this week brought a quiet calm to an empty campus. Our plaza centrally adorned by the majestic, universal beauty of the MLK sculpture was empty, or nearly so. A winter solitude settled on the center of our University.
Across the plaza hustled a young father, administrator and doctoral student. He is completed a dissertation on the leadership of our fourth President, Daniel Marsh. He paused in front of the Chapel named for his subject, and then saw last Sunday’s sermon title. Slowly, haltingly, deep in reverie, he came across the rest of the windswept emptiness.
Then he spoke: The Cost of Discipleship. I will never forget reading it in college. It changed me. It inspired me. It stays with me. Not since have I read it or anything like it. Bonhoeffer’s voice penetrated my heart and soul, and lives there still.
The Lenten series here offered, Marsh Chapel 2011, is lifted with the hope that such an experience, either of reading remembered or of words presently heard, will broadly be ours. May you know his voice, remember his voice, honor his voice, hold and be held by it. For something there is that warns us that sometime, maybe soon, maybe sooner than later, we shall need, deeply need to remember that voice. Our life, our salvation may in part depend upon it.
We are relying this Lent, for the application of the Gospel heard in Scripture and Life, upon a third voice, beyond that of Nicodemus and that of Bonhoeffer. This is the voice of Franklin Littell, who preached thunderously from this pulpit in 1952.
The meaning of the Holocaust for Christians is at least this: when the baptized betray their baptism, when those who have been grafted into history flee back out of history, when the new men and new women in Christ cast off the new life and become part of the dying age again, the old Israel is left alone as the sign that the God who is God yet rules…For Christians only: we must begin our agonizing self-assessment and reappraisal with the fact that in a season of betrayal and faithlessness the vast majority of the martyrs for the Lord of history were Jews. The Jewish people carried history while
the Christians fled headlong from their professed vocation. (80)
Israel and the Holocaust are alpine events deeply resented by many modern Christian teachers—the former, because its survival against great odds requires a theological reappraisal for which few are ready; the latter because popular religion admits error but denies guilt. (2))
Within the jail cell of his last years, Bonhoeffer penned memorable prayers, reflections, meditations, and a hymn that is located in our hymnal, and we shall sing it next week. It is a hymn of faith. A hymn we may hum when we want to summon the courage to change our mind. A hymn we may hum when we need to remember the supreme sacrifice of others. A hymn we may hum when we try again to see ourselves, truly, in our real location in history:
And confidently waiting come what may
We know that God is with us night and morning
And never fails to greet us each new day

Teachers union heads to Austin to talk school finance, vouchers
March 10, 2013 2:29 PM
A Corpus Christi teachers union will travel to Austin on Monday to meet with state lawmakers about restoring cuts to public education, opposing vouchers and protecting the Teacher Retirement System of Texas' pension fund.
Corpus Christi American Federation of Teachers will hold a rally on the south steps of the Capitol at 1 p.m., joining union members from El Paso, Houston, Dallas and McAllen, according to a news release provided by the union.
Senator Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, will kick off the rally and Mayor Nelda Martinez is expected to speak, the union release stated.
The union plans to meet with Sen. Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, and state Reps. Abel Herrero, D-Robstown, and Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi.
Lawmakers last session cut $5.4 billion from education, prompting school districts statewide to sue. State District Judge John Dietz ruled in February that the state's school finance system is unconstitutional. The state is expected to appeal.
School vouchers also have become a hot topic in the legislature this session, with Gov. Rick Perry advocating for lawmakers to consider them.
Herrero, who supports restoring funding cuts and opposes vouchers, said he looks forward to meeting with the Corpus Christi teachers to hear about how state budget cuts and overcrowded classrooms have affected them.
"There is no substitute from hearing it directly from the constituents," he said.
Union President Ray McMurrey said 200 people from Corpus Christi plan to make the trip.
Another teachers union, Corpus Christi Association of United School Employees, already visited lawmakers twice this session on the restoring funding and opposing vouchers.

Chad: Taking a Gamble with Better OddsPosted on Tuesday, July 19th, 2011 at 3:36 pm
By Francesca Reinhardt, Program Support Officer, Chad
At 6:30 am on the dot the rain begins to fall in Goré, southern Chad. It sounds like an avalanche clattering down on the tin roof overhead. This is the sound everyone’s been waiting for with bated breath, because it’s already mid-May and the rains should have started a few weeks ago. But after twenty minutes it stops. Is it a false alarm? There’s no more rain, but the air is thick and heavy and clouds still hover in the distance, promising more. So after a long, hot dry season, the farmers swing into gear.
When to plant is a serious gamble for farmers. If the rains don’t start in earnest, the soil will dry up and precious seeds will get blown away. If they wait too long, it might be too late, and food stores from the year before will have to last even longer. For many subsistence farmers, the months between the end of the harsh dry season and the first harvest are known as the “hunger gap,” when they have to survive on the last of the cereal crop, foraging, and loans.
There is an added danger that if families get too hungry, they will eat the seeds they need to plant for the next harvest, thus threatening their food supply for the following year. Some families hide their seeds in trees, or anywhere else that will keep them out of reach of hungry children. This is obviously a difficult choice for families to make: to have their children go hungry now, or risk starvation the following year.
Timing is everything. Concern has been pre-positioning seeds and tools to get ready for the planting season. The area around Goré gets cut off during the rainy season as the roads become impassable, so everything has to be ready to go as soon as the rains start. However, if seeds get distributed too early, they might be eaten or sold before the rains come. Working with refugee and host communities, Concern has built seed banks and stocked them with certified seeds for improved crop varieties. This ensures a reliable and affordable supply of seeds, and a safety net against bad harvests. Participants can borrow seeds for planting, and if the harvest is a success, deposit them again for the following year.
As soon as the first rains come, it’s time for the seed banks to organize distributions. Peanut and sesame seeds come first, followed by sorghum — which needs more water – a few weeks later. Eventually the seed bank committees will take over the entire process, but for now they work closely with Concern. This year there are 2,000 beneficiaries in three refugee camps and seven villages. As with regular borrowers applying for a bank loan, the beneficiaries have to show that they are practicing farmers and likely to return the loan.
A special effort is made to ensure that the poorest families participate.Alice Dero is treasurer of the seed bank committee in Dosseye Refugee Camp, near Goré. The committees are elected by the community, and Alice is the only woman on the executive. She has a formidable presence it would be hard to ignore. I have a feeling if she told me to do something I would comply pretty quickly.
Hundreds of people are milling around the seed bank, a weather-proof brick warehouse, trying to find a scrap of shade where they can wait their turn. Alice wastes no time putting people to work and doing crowd control. She herself measures out the 6kg of sesame seeds that everyone receives. Despite the commotion, the crowds of farmers and onlookers are good for transparency. As a public event, everyone can see what’s going on and who’s getting what. I ask her if it’s a lot of work, on top of her usual responsibilities as head of a big family. “Everything is work,” she says, “everything is work. But if the job’s done right, it’s worth it. Here I can see with my own eyes if it’s done right.”
Dosseye Refugee Camp looks like a sprawling village, and dwarfs many towns in the region. It is home to 10,000 refugees from the Kabba and Fula ethnic groups fleeing violence and instability in the Central African Republic (CAR). Kabbas, like Alice, are traditionally farmers who share ethnicity with some of the host population in Chad. The Fula are pastoralists who are rapidly learning to farm, now that their herds are gone and animal migration routes cut off. Putting farming and refugees together might seem unusual, but the 76,000 CAR refugees in Chad could be here for the long term. Some have been here for almost ten years, and the future in CAR is uncertain.
Uncertainty is a part of life here. No one knows ifthe refugees will be staying here another two years, five years, or forever. Year to year and month to month, subsistence farmers depend on numerous factors beyond their control. Will the rains come? Will there be floods? Will waves of locusts and birds devour the crops? Will mysterious blights and molds ravage them? Will animal migrations trample them? After the back-breaking harvest, will weevils and rats get into the grain stores? What happens when there’s not enough land? Will there be land-title disputes? You would think that just getting up in the morning is not for the faint of heart.
Better inputs, farming techniques, and management can make a big difference, but mastering all these variables at once is a remarkable feat for those who achieve it. There are definitely some bigger farmers making a go of it, usually by relying on several different sources of income to spread the risk. But the refugees of Dosseye and other nearby camps are living much closer to the edge, farming smaller plots, waiting for the clouds to burst. For them, just feeding their families is an amazing achievement..

Caaaaaaaaaaa-ney….
Labor is guilty of “Politics With Intent To Govern”.
It’s apparently a very serious offence, a clear violation of the Carney “Labor Is Always Bad and Grubby” Act, 2006 (as amended 2007, 2010 and just about every weekend thereafter).
He dismisses over three hundred pieces of legislation that Labor wanted, balancing them against one or two they they to agree with the Independents to pass so they could get all the other stuff through.
He tells us that Slipper is her problem. He omits to tell us that if Abbott had won the election, Slipper would have remained the Coalition’s problem.
It’s all “problems” to Carney. The achievements of government under a hung parliament are faffed-off by the patrician rose-water sniffer as merely some kinds of incidental, illusory saving graces, that are opposed, weakly, to the enormity and infamy of passing watered down poker machine legislation.
In case Shaun didn’t notice: Wilkie is better disposed to the government nowadays. The Clubs are quieter. The Labor back bench is more settled. The poker machine legislation passed the house last week (where the old version would not have passed the house in any week). Gilliard is still PM. The government is still in government. The Carbon Tax is about to start showing the punters that the world isn’t going to go up in a puff of soot…. one is reminded of a herd of BISONS.
The downside?
The polls are bad.
Carney, in his elegant, mannered way, is the same as the Coalition, their urgers at News and the bogan shock jocks with their rednecked caller mates. He just can’t get over the fact that as a government, this government has governed, and governed pretty effectively.
The cock-ups that usually remain behind closed doors have admittedly been made more public (aided by a media that regards paying prostitutes and trawling through Otto bins as a noble enterprise). Cock-ups, there have been, of course, but it is wrong for Carney to dismiss the vast body of solid legislation and governance as mere asides to an imagined main game of dysfunction and …. oh, the horror! …. political deal making.
Politicians do politics. They do deals. They govern in the best way they can, with the cards they are dealt, not the cards that previous governments were dealt.
Carney’s main gripe (although he’d never admit it) is the same as that of the most rednecked caller to the Hadley show: he’s a sore loser.
And he’s worried that things are going to get better.
As Megalogenis puts it: why would he be wailing so loud now, if he was so sure of victory in just a few short monhs?

North Korea ..or so we are told.
But your point is valid, there is a pervading cynicism toward our political leaders – it could be the pervasiveness of media, it could be the blurring of ideological lines (I would exempt the US fromtaht category), it could be the ‘professionalisation’ of a political caste. Possibly, as we are allmore educated, we are all more sceptical – the role of political parties in defining identity and their bases have also shrunk.

A brilliant little slice of the utterly transformative potential of the NBN. There simply is no excuse for not being on board with it. The cost is peanuts compared to some of the things we spend billions on. We can’t know what the new industries that will be developed thanks to a universal high speed communications system will be any more than someone in the mid 1800s could have predicted what would come of universal electricity networks, but we can be certain that it will be at the centre of our lives and economy in the decades to come.

Talking about dunnies. I grew up in the remote outback where the norm was an iron structure over a deep pit. At the rail siding at Abminga (SA) there was a hotel which sported a six-seater dunny (unisex at that) and I remember as a child imagining all six seats being occupied and what the conversation might be!
In Alice Springs there was the night cart system and it could be quite amusing to see someone come scurrying out of the dunny when the nightcart pulled up to change the pan, or to hear the tales of those visitors who didn’t know the routine and were caught by a blast of air on the bare bum as the pan was whipped out from under them.
In Darwin, there were the ‘flaming furies’ that were set alight every sunday evening. Lines and lines of huffing and puffing as the plumes of black smoke filled the air, and the long wait for the dunny seat to cool down enough afterwards.

A recent article – which I linked to here – outlined that the NBN would more than cover its costs threefold.
Once, by the improvement to health services. (One of the issues which comes up every year when local health users are surveyed is the need for transport and the cost of it. Interestingly, the conversation is shifting towards how the NBN can replace transport. And that’s only one area in which there’ll be savings to health).
Twice, by its ability to monitor, in real time, energy usage. At present, energy generation (as I understand it) is largely predictive – they THINK there’ll be an increase in demand, so they fire up the generators. They THINK demand is slowing, so they close them down.
Real time monitoring of energy usage will smooth out the problems this creates.
Thirdly, by replacing the copper network, which is getting increasingly more expensive to maintain as it ages.
And that’s without considering:
Telecommuting – if even 5% of our present workforce telecommuted (even part time) that would create huge savings on road maitenance, fuel emissions etc etc.
Education – again, if students can access classes remotely, this would see fewer buses on the roads (as students wouldn’t have to change schools to access their curriculum needs), fewer teachers (sorry. But it would save money), wider curriculum offerings to students (and thus a higher likelihood of them taking up courses at a higher level) etc etc.
And other savings: for example, we’re currently setting up a small business, based on my husband designing and building motorhomes from scratch.
To do this, he uses engines and gearboxes retrieved from wrecked cars bought at auction.
To attend an auction, he has to drive to Melbourne (7 hour round trip) and there’s no guarantee that he will be able to purchase the required car if he does so.
With the NBN, he doesn’t have to go anywhere – and he can access auctions not just in Melbourne but throughout Australia.
by zoomster on May 26, 2012 at 10:26 am
Victoria,these bus services were reorgansied because of the opening of the South Morang train extension – promised if you recall by the previous government in 1999 – and only brought on by them close to the 2010 election. However, that is not to say that lots have been inconvenienced by the withdrawal of the bus services. Both sides are guilty for losing the plot on service extension.
Except that the ALP built a tram extension to Vermont South that very few people seem to use.

The Age needs to remember it is a quality Newspaper and it does not have the rivers of gold anymore. The Herald Sun sell as you say as a sports paper that has some news.
The Age needs to shed old generation journos and go with new vibrant ones willing to change with the new world. That means no Grattan and others writing opinion pieces that are basically a load of BS and most know it. Instead they need to return to quality journalism.
This way they will survive. Their circulation will be greatly reduced but they have a bad business model trying for a mass market. Those days for the Age are gone. Those readers are on the internet getting their news. They have to do similar to Crikey and have good quality journalism people are willing to pay for.

Any PBer electricians?
Power has been out from yesterday arvo (lucky you lot not having to put with me) and finally been restored.
But no power points on one side of the house functioning. Power company says bad luck, we don’t fix those. Your expense, although demarcatingly?? if said outage caused an appliance to be fried that was connected to one of those power points then a claim could be made to replace the appliances at the power company’s expense.
Questions:
Would it be a blown fuse?
if so, is it possible to fix it without the expense of an electrician?
or is that illegal?

Abbott’s gone once the price on carbon is in place and it’s entrenched for a couple of months regardless of whether he becomes PM or not.
Don’t confuse that with the ALP will win the election if they get past July 1st. The public’s view of Gillard is very firm now and I fail to see how the PM’s going to turn it round from here. For a long time, I thought the PM would be able to do it, but now I know it’s too late. Needed clean air between April and July. Not her fault, but it’s the way it goes.

Watch Carefully as The Dallas Morning News Tippy-Toes Away from John Wiley Price read the fine print. The News has already started trying to write itself out of this story, an effort that will only get more obvious as this business unfolds.
Why is The News in it? Oh, you have not been keeping up, have you? Tsk-tsk. I thought I told you there would be an exam later on Jim Schutze columns.
If all you remember is Price as the firebrand protester who slow-walked with his "Warrriors" across the front of The News' property 20 years ago, then you may be in for a very bad grade. Since then The News has transmogrified into Price's principal aider, abettor, hagiographer and co-conspirator.
They love this guy.
It was only last April 17 that News reporter Scott Parks, normally a fine journalist, penned a kiss-ass portrait of Price, drooling over his collections of classic cars and weird Barbie Dolls, in which Parks offered this reportorial rebuff to Price's critics: "What most people don't see," Parks wrote, "is his day-to-day dedication to improving county government."
Ah, yes. That and ... how many cars are there again?
Now Price is the subject of an FBI investigation. That doesn't make him guilty of anything. But it sure has The News crab-walking away and covering its own traces.
The News has embraced Price warmly in recent years, working aggressively and shoulder-to-shoulder with him in what history will certainly deem to be Price's greatest betrayal of his own people, whether he ever gets indicted for it or not -- the Inland Port deal.
In 2005, Price led an effort to stymie development of a massive rail and shipping development called the Inland Port in the black part of the city. The Inland Port promised more than 60,000 well-paid jobs with benefits in an area of the city that has had a Third World economy since Reconstruction.
The main developer, Richard Allen, had just completed five years of land purchases, planning and permission-seeking from Dallas and other communities involved and was ready to start selling and leasing land. But Price decreed that the whole thing needed to be put on hold. He said lots more planning was needed before Allen would be ready for prime time.
This was just after Allen had shot down an attempt by four of Price's allies to get Allen to give them $1.5 million and a 15 percent cut of his family-owned company in exchange for their help making sure he didn't have any political problems with southern Dallas politicians.
In a story in Wednesday's Morning News, reporter Gromer Jeffers seeks to perpetuate two untruths about this transaction. We might call one of them a known untruth, in Rumsfeld-speak, and the second is more of a known unknown. But Jeffers knows better on both.
Of the demand that Price's allies made for a 15 percent stake in Allen's company, Jeffers writes, "The trio also wanted an opportunity to purchase 15 percent ownership in the development."
But both Allen and Price himself told me at the time that there was never any "purchase" contemplated in this picture. Allen told me when the group asked for an equity stake in the company, he told them everything he had out there on the ground was for sale. All they needed to do was give him an offer.
What he got was silence from them and more pressure from Price, who started doing everything he could to screw up a crucial road and bridge project Allen needed done on Wintergreen Road in Hutchins.
I discussed this with Price at the time. I asked why, if the group wanted equity, they didn't come up with some money for it. He told me that what they offered in exchange for equity was not money but "intellectual capital."
That would be the part about helping make sure Allen didn't get no windows broke, speaking in strictly political terms of course. That's "intellectual capital."
The other little tippy-toe dance-around in Jeffers's story involves an attempt to include state Sen. Royce West, in whose district the project was being developed, in the gravy train. In today's story, Jeffers reports as fact that it was the leader of the group, Pettis Norman, a Dallas Cowboy 100 years ago, who told Senator West it would be naughty for him to be a member for the group.
It would have been naughty for sure. West had major direct legislative say-so over important public funding for the project. The proposal was that West should be a hired consultant for Allen, helping make sure Allen didn't have any problems with people who had major direct legislative say-so over him (wink-wink).
In his report, Jeffers writes: "West was originally tapped to be the fourth member of the consulting group, which they called SALT, but Norman shot down the idea."
Yeah, that's what Norman says.
But as I reported at the time, Allen said different. Way different. He said he was the one who told Norman it would be screwed-up and shady for him to hire West, because West had major direct legislative say-so over him.
The guy really pushing all of this on Allen was southern Dallas radio personality Willis Johnson, now a contractor with DART, the city and the school district. Johnson also is the main southern Dallas political consultant to our recently elected mayor, Mike Rawlings.
Allen told me he told Johnson that hiring West was out of the question because of the obvious ethical pitfalls. He said Johnson came back at him several times. Allen quoted Johnson as telling him, "It's already been cleared with the ethics commission in Austin."
That would be the Texas State Ethics Commission -- an entity that any heads-up businessman would understand was an oxymoron at its birth and might as well be called the "Official State of Texas Cover-up and Alibi Commission for Way-Shady Sleazy Deals."
Allen told me: "I said, 'Well, I don't care if it's been cleared or not. It makes absolutely no sense. He needs to be able to represent his constituents.'"
In other words: fuggetaboutit.
But Allen says Johnson came back again, this time with the whole group on a speakerphone. .'"
He says later that Norman admitted to him that West had been present for that call. Norman told me that Allen was lying and that he had never said that.
But, look. You don't just report as fact that, 1) The Willis Johnson group wanted to pay for the equity they demanded, and 2) It was the high ethical standards of the Willis Johnson group that kept the greedy senator at bay. We know the first is not true. We know the second is staunchly disputed.
In a story about all this published in the News on April 12, 2009, Jeffers and county reporter Kevin Krause summed up the whole problem as a misunderstanding caused by Allen's own racial insensitivity: "Allen, who is white, appeared blind to the county's complicated racial politics," they reported as fact.
In an editorial four days later, the News wagged its finger at Allen for trying to rip off southern Dallas: "Going forward, white-dominated companies must keep foremost in mind the unique history of southern Dallas. It is not simply a great business opportunity to be exploited for maximum profit."
As I reported at the time, Allen's record for minority participation on his jobs far outstripped anything done by local Dallas companies. On the Wintergreen Bridge project, for example, Allen's minority participation was 55 percent. The prominent local company on that job championed by Commissioner Price had a minority participation of 4.9 percent.
Allen provided Price with a list of minority elected officials in areas all over the nation where he had done business and asked Price to contact them and inquire about his racial sensitivity. As far as Allen could tell, nobody ever called any of them.
Part of the wild hypocrisy in all this is the News' Pulitzer Prize winning series of editorials calling for a clean-up, spruce-up campaign in black southern Dallas devoted mainly to litter and code enforcement. Too bad their daily newspaper cronies on the Pulitzer committee never bothered to check out their record on the Inland Port.
But here's the point now. The News has been pushing and promoting Price and his agenda for years. We can talk about why later. It will all come out. Basically, Price, who is very smart, has figured out the formula. There is no Dallas or Dallas County. There is no Fort Worth or Tarrant County. Those are meaningless abstractions.
In the world of power and money in North Texas there are only families -- five or six. Price picked a couple to work for.
From here on out, if you read the News closely, you are going to see them doing with Price exactly what they are also trying to do with their other great passion, the proposed Trinity River Toll Road. They're going to be busy getting their story right by getting it wrong.
Don't forget. There will be a quiz in heaven.

Romo gets smart
Former pumped-up Bronco Bill Romanowski makes a tackle in “Get Smart,” the high grossing retake of the scratch some, err, foreign matter off his shoe with a matchstick — when Romo leaps into action.
He’s actually a Federal Air Marshal and he figures Max is trying to light a shoe bomb.
Romo tackles Max. Cut to Max in plastic handcuffs.
Max gets Romo to let him use the head (Max says he has to “squeeze a lemon”) while Romo chats up a stewardess, admitting that he’s “into protein.”
Funny?
Maybe — but Denver audiences are eating it up.
At least more than “Wien.

ORLANDO, FL — Dana and David Curtis have the right idea when it comes to doing Disney World.
Even though it was near dusk when they got to Orlando, the Birmingham couple headed straight for the Magic Kingdom with their two young sons and found smaller than expected crowds.
“We checked in and came right over. We got here after dark and haven’t waited in a single line,” crows Curtis as he exits the newly-rethemed Great Goofini Barnstormer ride with 3-year-old Christian. ”This is his first roller coaster and he did it three times — it’s awesome! I had to take a break before he did.”
Before leaving the park’s new Storybook Circus section, the Curtises regrouped under a big-top tent at Pete’s Silly Sideshow where they posed for photos, no wait at all, with Disney characters including stunt pilot Goofy, snake-charmer Donald Duck and circus star Minnie Mouse. The family also whirled through the sky in elephant-shaped cars on the newly-redone Dumbo, the Flying Elephant attraction that now boasts two side-by-side Dumbo rides.
It’s all part of the “New Fantasyland,” a multi-million dollar, multi-year project that’s the largest expansion in the Magic Kingdom’s 41-year history. Located just beyond the original Fantasyland, in the shadow of Cinderella’s Castle, it’s generating plenty of buzz, along with surging crowds, at the perenially-popular Orlando theme park.
In addition to Storybook Circus, New Fantasyland features an Enchanted Forest with waterfalls, grottoes, arched bridges and two new movie-inspired castles inhabited by the Beast from “Beauty and the Beast” and Eric from “The Little Mermaid.” They’re designed to bring the two Disney classics to life by taking parkgoers beyond castle walls and inside their favorite stories.
To experience ”Under the Sea — Journey of the Little Mermaid,” an ”E”-ticket attraction, we boarded an oversized clamshell for a five-minute extravaganza of songs from the film, performed by crabs, starfish and 180 other colorful audio-animatronics characters, including the 7 1/2-foot-tall Ursula and her steaming cauldron and crystal ball. Disney’s trademark special effects make it feel almost as if you’re descending below the ocean surface.

Afterward, it’s fun to follow the twists and turns of Ariel’s Grotto and pose for photos with a live version of the famous mermaid. But guys, don’t be so dazzled by her flowing red hair and clam shell-topped bosom that you trip over her sparkly, green-sequinned tail.
Another interactive experience, ”Enchanted Tales with Belle,” takes park-goers through Belle’s father’s cottage and the Beast’s library and taps participants to interact with a live Belle and animatronic Lumiere. Props and costumes are dispensed by an oversize, talking Madame Wardrobe. Bottom line: corny but cute, thanks to endearing little kids from the audience and their frantically photo-taking parents.
Perhaps the most buzzworthy New Fantasyland attraction is the “Be Our Guest Restaurant,” an enchanted dining experience that’s so popular in the early going that, without advance reservations, you can’t get anywhere near it for dinner — even after dark.
I’ll tell how to best see it in my next blog. Stay.

Where Does Anna Go From Here?
Anna Hazare’s movement has fizzled out. The Lokpal bill is in cold storage. Anna himself is a rustic old man, out of touch with modern thinking.
Right? Wrong – thrice over. The drawing rooms of south Mumbai and south Delhi took to Anna with great enthusiasm last year. The middle-class gathered at Jantar Mantar and Azad Maidan but the intellectual elite provided drawing room and television studio support. Anna was the flavour of 2011. What went wrong?
Anna’s first mistake was to make his movement a one-issue crusade – the Jan Lokpal Bill. His team did not advocate – as it should have – a “strong Lokpal Bill but the "Jan Lokpal Bill”. The rigidity jarred even the faithful.
Anna’s second mistake was to allow the allegations of financial impropriety, however minor, against team members Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal to remain unresolved.
By December 2011, public sentiment, desperately looking for an anti-corruption messiah, began turning against Anna. The living rooms of south Mumbai and Delhi, never known for intellectual stamina over public causes, began to mock the “rustic” Anna and his hubristic team.
Battered for months by Anna’s movement, the UPA 2 government activated its DTD (Dirty Tricks Department). The DTD had in mid-2011, at the height of Jantar Mantar, used sections of the friendly media to discredit individual members of Team Anna.
There were initially two DTD ploys:
1. A CD of Prashant Bhushan, purportedly in conversation with Amar Singh, was played up in the press by the DTD. But when it was proved that the CD had been doctored, the story and the retraction were quietly buried.
2. Anna was quoted by the DTD (faithfully reported by a section of the press) as saying: “Voters are corrupt”. In fact, he’d said – rightly – that voters are being corrupted by politicians who use money and muscle power and deliberately cause religious and caste divisions in order to win votes. Again the true quote was buried.
Once seeds of doubt had been planted by such Machiavellian disinformation, the sheen around Anna began to dull. Team Anna made it worse by not countering the DTD’s Goebbelsian methods more robustly. It compounded the problem by not being more transparent about the allegations of financial impropriety against Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal.
The government used Kejriwal’s Hissar election campaign to claim Team Anna’s motives were political. By the time Anna had broadened his crusade to include electoral reforms (especially proposed legislation barring candidates facing magistrate-framed criminal charges from contesting elections), the damage had been done. Congress spokesman Manish Tewari had been forced to apologise in writing for calling Anna “corrupt from head to toe” and barred from TV for two months. Now he was back, in fine fettle, grin firmly in place.
Just as we’ve identified Anna’s errors, let’s pick out the errors of Anna’s critics, one by one.
1. The Lokpal Bill is not a panacea. It won’t put an end to corruption.
The Lokpal bill was never meant to be a panacea. And it was never meant to put an end to corruption. It was always meant to be the starting point of the fight against corruption. When you distort a proposition and then proceed to discredit it, only the corrupt will win.
2. The Lokpal by itself is not enough.
Of course it isn’t. On Saturday, February 18, 2012, I wrote a piece on the edit page of The Times of India, A New Grid Of Governance, which suggested that the Lokpal should be one of five interlocked institutional anti-corruption pivots. The other four: an independent CBI, the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a new National Judicial Commission. All five institutions, with constitutional or statutory authority, would form an integrated grid to curb corruption. To claim that the Lokpal alone is an anti-corruption panacea is to not understand the principle behind an ombudsman.
Finally, a myth surrounding the RTI needs to be buried for good. The UPA government claims credit for passing this fine piece of legislation in 2005. But in the decade from 1995 to 2005, politicians – many from the Congress – opposed it tooth and nail. Who finally pushed through the Maharashtra RTI in 2003 after years of fasting and agitation – a bill that was used as an inspiration and model for the central RTI? Why, Anna Hazare.
But public memory is short and selective. Politicians are delighted by this and claim credit for the RTI which they have since systematically tried to weaken, including taking the CBI out of its purview last June.
Where does Anna go from here? His team’s allegations against 15 ministers, including the prime minister, should be resolved in court. If found false, the signatories of the letter to the PM containing the allegations, led by Anna, should be sued for defamation. Team Anna has simultaneously in its letter to the PM outlining these allegations asked for a judicial probe against Team Anna members as well. The government must accept this offer.
Let us, however, not be distracted in the fight against corruption. Anna may not be the messiah people thought, but at least he has made corruption an issue no government can afford to ignore anymore. For this alone he should be lauded.
The anti-corruption movement must continue. Individuals don’t matter. Anna, Kejriwal, Bedi, Bhushan, Sisodia have all played their parts, for better or worse. It is up to the larger public now, India’s citizens, to take up the baton and continue the battle against graft till it is won.

CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES
The well-intentioned provisions of our Constitution that make it a sacred-cow are observed only in their breach by the Executive which is just not more than a handmaid of the Legislature; the Legislature that comprises of those tainted politicians, most of whom have gate-crashed into the exalted institutions of democracy- the Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies- by polling even less than 20% of the votes and that too not always by fair means- and now wield absolute power absolutely without any accountability. That underlines the dire need of an Anna- phenomenon in our country that could usher in the big change in the system of our governance through series of reforms after bringing about an adequately empowered and sufficiently strong institution of LOKPAL and electoral reforms- the two issues presently on Anna’s agenda. Others such as, completely deglamorising the institution of the President, formation of pan-India constituency and electorate for the purpose of electing the Prime-minister and so forth will follow. Naturally, it would be a long-drawn out war after the series of battles are won. So Anna has miles to go. Long live

It's the latest strategy of pulling the string of so called politicians than accuse Anna. Why Anna or Baba Ramdev be called as ALIBABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES who any way want's to bring back the stashed amount looted more than the Britishes from India and those who accuse or oppose they might be linked one way or the other with politicians and keep common mans mouth shut. It's disgrace to the people who fought 1857 revolution and give some solace to the souls for which are proud and maintain the sanctity.

Please do not call Anna team "circus".By this type of journalism, you are not discharging your professional commitment towards Indians who are fed up with corrupt polticians and a few crusaders are the only hope left.If you can not support them due to any reason or professional/economic compulsion, please keep quite/neutral.THis will be a great service towards hapless and helpless fellow Indians.

Champions of civil society want CBI to be independent of the Government. Is it possible for the civil society to be strong enough financially and intellectually to have an investigaive wing of it's own for at least those cases of utmost national importance and then challenge the findings of CBI in the court? Civil society should spend it's energy and resources to bring in electoral reforms,making our police professionally strong not to submit to political pressure, and judiciary to be fast enough to decide the cases without delay at least during the life time of the culprits.Unfortunately many of the enthusiasts of corruption free India are running NGOs of doubtful integrity.

Mr Merchant, i disagree with you on many counts, some of these are highlighted below.
1. First of all your hasty decision of calling that the Anna movement has fizzled out, is very incorrect. I consider that the sholay are simmering and getting very hot and not visible but will come up again and gulp the ruling elite, who are probably encouraged by articles from persons like you and information spread by DTD.
2. If people in your capacity misinterpret what all is talked about by Anna on lokpal bill than i think we can not expect a justice from press and media. Your statement a “strong Lokpal Bill but the "Jan Lokpal Bill” is just false and it seems that you are also effected by the DTD propaganda. Every individual of team Anna has announced in no uncertain terms that they want a strong bill and not necessarily their JLPB.
3. It is pity that you consider that Anna had only one issue despite his taking about election reforms, vote to recall and vote to reject etc. but at the same time one can not and should not take up all the issues simultaneously. We have in front of us Baba Ram Dev's approach, he took up dozens of issue and the movement died down over night.
4. On financial impropriety: once again press did not come out strongly that the corruption associated with Anna team subject to analysis is in no way comparable to the one done by UPA.
5. RTI myth was well covered but once again press and media did not explain very strongly and neutralised the effect of DTD that congress can not claim victory that they have given RTI because they thought it will help root out the corruption.

Richard Denison, Ph.D., is a Senior Scientist. Allison Tracy is a Chemicals Policy Fellow.
A major initiative of EPA’s toxics office finally made it across the finish line yesterday when EPA posted a pre-publication copy of the final rule upgrading its chemical reporting system under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The process took over 16 months just to get from the draft of the proposed rule to yesterday’s final rule, with EPA having to endure not one but two nearly six-month regulatory reviews by the Office of Management and Budget.
The wait was largely worth it: EPA’s new program – renamed the Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule – significantly advances chemical production and use reporting relative to its predecessor, the more arcane-sounding Inventory Update Reporting (IUR) rule. Most, though not all, of the critical elements EPA proposed last year made it through to the final rule. The catch is we’ll have to wait until 2016 for the program to reach its full potential.
The significance of this reporting program is under-appreciated: It is the only systematic means by which the federal government – and by extension the American public – gets any picture of which chemicals are produced in or imported into this country, by what companies, in what amounts and for what uses. This kind of information is crucial to EPA’s efforts to carry out its mission to assess and manage the risks that chemicals may pose to human health and the environment.
Given the obvious need for such information, it is astounding that this program to collect it, in place since 1986, was so flawed as to yield not only an incomplete, but actually an inaccurate, picture of chemical production and use. Changes made to the program in the mid-2000s in many ways made matters even worse, by reducing the frequency of reporting from one out of every four to one out of every five years, and by dramatically scaling back the number of chemicals reported by raising the reporting threshold from 10,000 to 25,000 pounds per year per site of production.
The new leadership at EPA undertook to change this situation to the extent it could. While the final rule fails to reverse the threshold increase made in the mid-2000s, the reporting frequency has been returned to every four years – AND the rule will require reporting of production volume for every year in each cycle if the threshold is triggered for any year in the cycle.
As we noted in comments we filed on the proposed rule, the previous system of reporting volume data for only a single year in each five-year cycle yielded a very inaccurate picture of which chemicals are actually in commerce. We’ll have to wait until the 2016 reporting cycle for that to kick in, unfortunately, although in the 2012 cycle at least we’ll get production volume data for both 2010 and 2011. Production volumes have been shown to fluctuate enormously from year to year, so having a system that provides year-to-year production data is essential to providing a reliable picture of the magnitude of chemical commerce.
One of the few positive aspects of the mid-2000s changes – in principle – was the addition of a requirement for companies to report processing and use information – a critical gap in both government’s and the public’s knowledge base on chemicals that has severely limited our ability to understand the potential risks posed by a chemical. But the intent was stymied by three conditions placed on such reporting. First, it only applied to chemicals produced above a whopping 300,000 pounds per year per site – a small minority of the chemicals subject to any reporting. Second, such information could be claimed confidential without providing any justification. And third, a company could claim the requested information to be “not readily obtainable” and get out of having to report it at all.
EPA’s final rule addresses all three of these flaws:
- The threshold for reporting processing and use information is being lowered, to 100,000 pounds per year per site in the reporting to be done next year, and to 25,000 pounds per year per site in the 2016 cycle.
- Any confidentiality claim must be accompanied by up-front substantiation, which acts both to reduce the number of claims made and ensure those that are made are warranted.
- Finally, the “not readily obtainable” loophole – very heavily used in the last reporting cycle – has been eliminated, replaced with the more conventional “not reasonably ascertainable” standard – which means you actually have to put some effort into trying to find the requested information.
Two other positive changes to note:
- While the overall reporting threshold remains at 25,000 pounds per year per site, that threshold has been lowered to 2,500 pounds per year per site for those chemicals for which EPA has undertaken certain actions based on concerns about their risks. These include chemicals for which EPA has issued Significant New Use Rules (SNURs), has listed as chemicals of concern (assuming OMB ever allows EPA to propose such a list), or has regulated under Section 6 of TSCA (the latter has rarely been used due to the high burden of proof EPA must carry, though EPA is considering trying to do so again). Importantly, EPA need only have proposed, as opposed to finalized, such an action in order for the lower reporting threshold to apply.
- EPA will now require electronic reporting under the new rule. Believe it or not, this was controversial even in 2011. The lack of such a requirement in the last reporting cycle led to both major delays in EPA’s release of the data it collected and inaccuracies introduced by EPA being forced to manually translate information from hard copy to electronic form.
The final rule is not perfect: the reporting threshold remains too high, wide latitude remains for industry to claim its submissions to be confidential business information (CBI), and most unfortunately, some of the key improvements made by EPA won’t hit the road until 5 years from now.
But given what the Agency had to navigate in the way of industry opposition, OMB meddling and delay and complaints from some in Congress, all in all, not a bad day’s (well, actually a couple years’) work.
One Comment
Richard, Is there any useful nexus or information share between EPA and Dept. of Homeland Security with respect to chemicals?

The Post Glacial forest is a recreation of the vegetation that occurred in the region as the Vashon glacier receded from its Olympia terminus. The plant palette is based on palynology data from pollen core samples taken from wetlands in the Puget Sound area. The late glacial period samples from which the plant palette was primarily derived range in age from 13,500 to 11,400 years old.
Some artistic license was taken given design and availability limitations. Thus the result is to some degree a historical fiction. However, the Post Glacial Forest does contain species known from the pollen record by 8,000 years ago.
During construction of Seminar Building II, the construction company saved erratic boulders left on site by the last retreating glacier. Additional erratics were brought in to complete the landscape as designed.
Lodgepole pine dominate with a small grove of aspen. Sedges dominate the understory.
How to get to the garden:
This garden can be found along the ramp leading down from the east side of Red Square, continues past the Sem II Cafe, and ends at the interpretive panel near the Communications Building.

Oh, c'mon, Guin. A LITTLE funny.
This appears to be one of those largely gender based ones. The sensitive, caring gender thinks this is horrible, the beer drinking "guy" gender thinks this is a laugh riot.
And the Emeril watching gender wonders what the dog tasted like.

Oh sure, take the dog's side, people, even though I didn't see ANY report of what went on prior to the attack.
Blind Guy: Come on Rex, please just lead me home. Please? We haven't been home for two weeks.
Rex: Sure, here we go.
Blind Guy: But, this doesn't sound right, and it doesn't smell right. You're leading me to that field where you romp with all the stray dogs again, aren't you? I'm telling you, I can't take it! They hump my legs mercilessly! I need my medicine and some food.
Rex: Bite me, blindy.

Gotta love this new mobile augmented reality experience from VW.
It does involve a special app - which is asking a lot of consumers. But for those interested enough to download it, the experience is fun, lively and goes at least a little way in helping Beetle seem more modern and (almost) masculine.
I do hope the app comes with a dealer locator and the ability to customize a Beetle using AR, along with the ability to schedule a test drive.
This particular initiative is from Canada, and is part of a larger social+mobile+who knows what else that will run through November 26.
What's your take? Does it get you revved up for the Beetle? Or inspiration in reverse?

Content Marketing Makes Its Mark
Posted By Najwa Smith On February 5, 2013 @ 7:58 AM In Opinions | 5 Comments pioneered over a century ago when it began publishing Westways magazine [1]. But today’s digital environment and new expanded “universal” organic search engine results afford multiple channels of communication, including articles, blogs, digital magazines, eBooks, email newsletters, micro sites, podcasts, social media channels, videos, webinars, white papers, and wikis. Specific examples you might be familiar with are Barnes & Noble’s dedicated YouTube channel Nook Study Channel [2], or the Whole Foods’ Blog [3].
Home Made Simple [4], a micro site created by P&G, is often cited in articles about content marketing. Full of recipes, decorating ideas and organizing tips with a homespun, retro feel, it embodies one of the first and foremost industry best practices -- “Share, don’t shill.” Share a resource with customers or solve a problem for them, don’t just sell a product. It sounds obvious, but the temptation for marketers is often too great to ignore!
Secondly, “Reimagine instead of recycle.” View each piece of content as part of a larger whole to be chopped up and reconfigured in different ways. For example, interviewing the author of a white paper for a podcast, producing a webinar based on key findings, then taking three key points and writing a series of three blog posts. Reimagining content allows the creation of a content circle of life that feeds itself more efficiently.
Both best practices deal with issues Content Strategists struggle with daily. The need to understand audiences, craft language and target messaging, efficiently leverage assets, and carefully plan for ongoing updates are the primary roles of Content Strategy.
Content Marketing isn’t a replacement for Content Strategy, but rather the natural growth and evolution of it, taking Content Strategy’s framework, processes and concepts off the website and into all areas of the digital world. A Content Marketer might be described as a cross between an SEO Specialist and a Social Media Guru. In that case, their wise and web-savvy grandparent must have been a Content Strategist. But seriously, we’re all partners, coming together to tell create one seriously compelling experience, regardless of how you slice and dice that content.

Earlier this year, it was reported that Quentin Tarantino was hard at work on his next film, with a script due sometime this spring. Last night, fansite The Quentin Tarantino Archives dropped the first nugget of information. They got their hands on an image of the first page of the script -- which looks like it was written by a five-year old with a broken hand (you can check it out below) -- revealing the title to be "Django Unchained." Well a bit more digging has been done and not only has the title been confirmed, but a cast member, potential shooting dates and even a possible synopsis have emerged. Like we said, the buzz has grown deafening fairly quickly.
Thompson On Hollywood picked up the ball and reaching out to their sources at WME, confirmed that yes, "Django Unchained" is indeed the title, and that it will be a spaghetti western. Moreover, they spoke with reps for Christoph Waltz and also confirmed that the "Inglourious Basterds" star will reunite with Tarantino for the film.
But let's rewind for a moment shall we? As you might remember, a few months ago Italian actor Franco Nero said he was teaming with Tarantino for a spaghetti western that would star Waltz, Treat Williams and Keith Carradine and that the film would shoot in the United States. Now whether or not Nero, Williams or Carradine will be involved remains to be seen, but the Nero connection is made stronger given that the actor starred in the influential 1966 spaghetti western "Django" directed by Sergio Corbucci. And as any genre fan knows, that film was recently referenced by Takashi Miike in his 2007 film "Sukiyaki Western Django" which -- to bring it all back -- featured Quentin Tarantino in a small role.
Over at Deadline, Mike Fleming adds that the film is aiming for a late summer or early fall shoot with Tarantino's longtime buds The Weinstein Company to handle domestic distribution, with all the majors pretty much scrapping it out for international rights. Additionally, he adds that casting will be "top-shelf."
But perhaps the most interesting nugget comes from Shadow & Act who snagged this comment made over at Hollywood Elsewhere from someone who claims to have read the script:.
Of course, there's no confirmation that this is accurate but it sounds a helluva lot like the slave/western idea Tarantino had talked about in early 2010. At the time he had' [which Uma Thurman confirmed earlier this year]."
He also definitely a lot to chew on right now, but just to recap: Quentin Tarantino is reteaming with Christoph Waltz for a spaghetti western titled "Django Unchained." Fucking A.

It's completely accurate. I'm reading the script now.

Black Dynamite proved Michael Jai White is awesome, and should be given every possible opportunity to exhibit that awesomeness.
hank | May 2, 2011 3:00 AM
@Alex P, all hank said was he wanted Eddie Murphy. I appreciate your study of Tarantino's use of "homage", but you hateful.
Alex P | May 2, 2011 1:47 AM
Hayden, did you ever read that script? You are giving Quentin FAR too much credit.
J. Bone | May 2, 2011 1:44 AM
Djimon Hounsou would be hot pick for the lead in this flick. His wife ought to be Queen Latifa, the mentor would have to be Michael Madsen and the evil plantation massa should be Ed Harris.
This is how it will be once I finally achieve my goal of becomming undisputed king of the entire universe. Meanwhiles, we'll just go with QT's picks.

Did you not watch the climax of Inglourious Basterds that very explicitly questions the futility and morality of using cinema as a way to play out revenge fantasies? There's a lot going on in that movie. It's not about how the ideas got there that led to genocide but how the subjugated people react and their thirst for revenge.
rudy | May 1, 2011 9:09 AM
Michael Jai WHITE! Tarantino owes him for cutting out his cool death scene from kill bill
Ive had goodbye uncle tom for a long time seems like nows the time to watch it.

Eddie Murphy for Django.
reader | May 1, 2011 5:40 AM
Remember when the Playlist said (circa 2009 Cannes) that Tarantino was in a creative rut? Well it doesn't look like its coming to an end soon.
Billyboy | May 1, 2011 4:52 AM
Will Smith? He's such a bore...
I prefer someone like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie or even Forrest Whitaker (he might be too old, though)
Roark | May 1, 2011 4:43 AM
I'd rather see someone like Anthony Mackie in the lead...
Rufus | May 1, 2011 3:03 AM
I second Will Smith. Hey, why not?
Cory Everett | May 1, 2011 2:37 AM
@Brad The film was never called "The Southern," it was just Tarantino's way of saying he wanted to do a "Western" set in the South in slavery times.
Ken | May 1, 2011 2:32 AM
Well the Playlist was completely wrong about Inglourious Basterds (I think it's his best film so far) so whenever this comes out, I'll take their word with a grain of salt.
Xian | May 1, 2011 2:09 AM
Badass = Michael K. Williams (Omar Little on the range, y'all)
Alex P | May 1, 2011 1:36 AM
You moron (@brad), it was never going to called "Southern," it was TARANTINO's southern; as in, before he had a title for it Tarantino said he was going to make a movie and it would HIS 'southern.' This was his way of referring to the project he had not yet written, but was very much in his mind.
And@hank, considering Inglourious was a ripped-off title and film plot redone to suit his own purposes and Django Unchained, sounds like it's once again using an existing film for Tarantino to riff on and rethink, maybe his IS in a creative rut considering his hasn't written an original idea since Kill Bill (and even then obviously Tarantino's films are like mash-ups of other ideas or blatant thefts from other films -- City Of Fire is liberally stolen from for Resevoir Dogs). Let's not forget if you've ever read any Tarantino bios, he basically took an unfinished Roger Avary script to write True Romance and he tried to bilk Avary's credit for Pulp Fiction after he himself had lifted Avary's short film "Pandemonium Reigns"and incorporated it into Fiction.
So yeah, no question, the dude can write his ass off, but his ideas aren't the most original in the whole world and frankly, Django Unchained sounds like Inglourious Basterds all over again, but instead of the jews getting revenge -- his only theme it seems -- on the nazis, its the slaves getting revenge on their masters.
It's an idea ripe for commentary on racism in America, but lord knows, Inglorious had zero commentary on anti-semitism, or the rank evils of Nazism or their deplorable ideas. It was a revenge B-movie and that's it. So think about it before you open your mouth.
Mr. Arkadin | April 30, 2011 12:02 PM
I like the idea of putting some "Mandingo" and Addio, zio Tom" up in the spaghetti western mix, but referencing the title to the whole Django thing is kinda lame (especially for german speaking people, this gag is seriously old).
let's hope they find someone fresh and comparable to a young Woody Strode as the lead (and Fred Williamson better have an awesome cameo!).
also I guess Morricone is pretty much a done deal.
edge | April 30, 2011 11:11 AM
i'll bet Keith Carradine plays the plantation owner
Brad Milne | April 30, 2011 10:43 AM
So much for the film being called the southern.
KT | April 30, 2011 10:31 AM
I want Will Smith.
Yeah, I know, I know, but I want him in the role.

At a time when reports from Iraq seem bleak at best, columnist Cal Thomas expresses his hope “that success may be closer than we think” in this column on today’s Opinion pages. He quotes from documents seized by U.S. soldiers last month and reportedly authored by an al-Qaida operative that depict the insurgency as disorganized and faltering. He concludes: “These documents ought to encourage not only the U.S. government, but also American public opinion, that the virtues of patience and commitment are likely to achieve the stated objectives of freedom and a self-sustaining Iraqi government.”
You’d like to share Thomas’ optimism, but news reports Tuesday still painted another picture: The new government remains unformed (with a May 22 deadline looming), at least 511 Iraqis have been killed this month, and at least three more U.S. soldiers have died this week.

Every year I get into Austin at the tail end of the Interactive portion of the SXSW conference, which means I get to watch a city flooded with tech folks turn into what some people call rock ‘n’ roll Spring Break. The transformation happens almost overnight and its a blast to witness. You start to hear rumblings about which big bands are playing secret shows (I hear a big English rock trio is playing Stubbs on Friday) and which smaller bands are the ones to watch (so far — Broken Bells, Surfer Blood, Fitz and the Tantrums, Washed Out, Real Estate, Besnard Lakes, The Middle East, Strange Boys, Theophilus London). Right now, I’m enjoying copious amounts of Mexican food (why don’t we have good queso in LA??) and sitting down whenever I can. I’ll be standing for most of the rest of the week. Can’t wait to report back with some new favorite bands!

I’ve been listening to the repeat broadcast of the Howard Stern Show, recorded live in New York as the 9/11 events unfolded. It’s been a transporting experience. The anger, bewilderment, confusion and fear are all there.
I was at our house in Montecito, California when it happened. My sister Jan called right after the first tower was hit, and we watched the rest on TV. Then I switched to the radio and blogged a number of posts through the day. Here they are (in reverse chronological order):
The deepest human substance
A time for love and mourning
What’s the commercial model for your toilet? Your light socket? Your floors?
Because smart people don’t always do that
Blogging was young then. There was no Twitter, no Facebook. Yet blogging felt, and was, far more social — at least for me — than anything else we’ve seen since.
Some thoughts, ten years later:
- Yes, everything changed that day.
- We did go to war, as I expected we would, given the president we had and the mood of the country after being attacked. But the war, billed as one against “terrorism,” has been one of “regime change” in two countries. Since then other regimes have changed that needed changing, without our intervention, and at approximately zero $ cost to the U.S.
- The cost of going to war has been many $trillions, and has nearly (or perhaps actually) bankrupted the country. There was a rope-a-dope strategy behind the attack, and we took the bait.
- The U.S. hasn’t been attacked in the same way again, and for that I am grateful.
- The results of the War on Terrorism are debatable, although they are not much debated.
- The motivations for the attacks on the U.S., besides “they hate us and our way of life” and similar staples of talk radio, have not been visited at much depth, at least by sources the American people pay much attention to. That anybody might have a legitimate gripe against the U.S. is a question no politician wants to ask. And not many ordinary citizens, either.
- Many young men and women in my extended family have served in these wars. I am proud of them. I also wish they hadn’t needed to go.
- The peace movement, in which I played a small part during the Vietnam War, is now dormant. Almost nobody questions the need for war now.
- The hate we felt for Al Qaeda, the self-appointed enemy that attacked on 9/11, has since shifted to each other. I’ve been alive for a long time, and I can’t remember any period, including the Vietnam War, when it has been harder for political opponents to listen to each other, much less understand what the other is saying. Ad hominem arguments rule.
- One reason for our uncompromising political posturing and rhetoric is the loss of the moderate center that was held in place by the mainstream media, and especially by the evening network news. Even as late as 2001, we turned en mass to network TV and newspapers for reporting and analysis that at least tried to be unbiased, accountable and responsible to the whole country and not just to partisan factions. Now even CNN looks like an informercial to me.
I can’t shake the feeling that, in ways we don’t want to admit, the terrorists have won something. 9/11 gave us fear, and the will to attack. It changed our hearts and minds.
When I look back on human history, starting with our diaspora out of Africa only a few dozen millennia ago, I see persisting through it all a will to kill and dominate that is hardly diminished by civilization. We have hated and killed The Other for the duration. For all its many virtues, our species remains a violent and homicidal one. We’ve killed others who looked or spoke differently than we do. We’ve killed for land and religion and resources, which included each other, whom we often kidnapped and made into slaves. Even in our own country we killed each other by the dozens of thousands, over differing notions of freedom. (The Civil War is only two generations back on my father’s side. One great aunt, whom I remember well, was twelve years old when Lincoln was shot, and told stories about it. She was born when slavery was still more than legal in the U.S.)
How many people have died because of 9/11, since that day? Have their deaths been worthwhile? Have they bought peace, really? Will anything, ever? I have my doubts, and those started ten years ago today.
[Later...] Deaths in the War on Terror, according to Wikipedia, as of today:
- Iraq: 62,570 to 1,124,000
- Afghanistan: between 10,960 and 49,600
- Pakistan: between 1467 and 2334
- Somalia: 7,000+
And then,
Total American casualties from the War on Terror
(this includes fighting throughout the world):
Draw, or re-draw, your own conclusions. I still don’t have any. Or many. The older I get, the less certain I am of my own opinions, especially about War, the reasoning methods for which which seem to be hard-coded into human nature. In my heart I’m still a pacifist, but in my mind I’m not so sure.
Here’s what I wrote in Deliberate Explosive Devices last year:video.
Still true.

There has been cultural progress since 9/11. One example that speaks to me personally is the integration of gay men and women into the mainstream — in politics, marriage, family structures, the military, professional life. So there is hope for a better, more just, and less violent future.
What strikes me reading this list ten years on is that we still are looking for a commercial model for the Internet, rather than accepting that culture doesn’t come wrapped in plastic cases from Disney.
-
Here’s what *I* blogged that day:
Hear, hear,
I have been avoiding all the coverage of the 10th anniversary since I can’t imagine the mainstream media – nor most of the alternative channels – adding anything meaningful.
As an Australian even the emotional impact of the attack is only second-hand (at best). Intellectually I can understand the effect it must have had but the reaction has caused many more problems than it solved.
Treating terrorism as a criminal matter (as was done by most other countries that were attacked afterward) seems to be more effective than giving the bad guys credibility by calling them ‘the enemy’.
Relevant to this (though I could not, of course, have known it when I wrote the essay) is that for the past 10 years, TSA’s official “threat level” has never gone below “orange.” TSA has, of course, an interest in keeping it that way because — at least in their minds — it gives them and some of their more absurd rules a raison d’être.
The best comment on 9/11 I’ve read to date in terms of matching my feelings about what’s happened was this post on SlashDot a crime?
Alas, we are still attacking ourselves, our citizens, and our fundamental rights 10 years later. See, for example,

I remember I’d just come home from the university that day. I turned on my TV and saw the 1st WTC tower on fire then the 1st seconds I heard that an airplane crashed in it. In the beginning I started thinking that it was a new action movie, but after 1 minute I started feeling sadness and fear and after the 2nd plane as you mentioned Doc the will to fight back. That was not a movie, that was a reality. I realized that those terrible things were going to change the world.
I believe 1 day the humanity and common sense are going to be among human, not the animal instincts to be dominant like the #1 rase or #1 religion or whatever. WE ARE PEOPLE!
Thanks for the post Doc.
God bless.

TSA Body Scanner Program Is Super Pervy, Must Be Terminated, Says Appeals Court
Hallelujah: Security checkpoints across the nation will no longer serve as First Amendment-scoffing peep shows for the feds! (At least for the time being.)
A three-judge panel from the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled today that TSA's body scanners, better known as porn machines, were installed without notifying the public and seeking comment -- and are therefore illegal under federal law. The program must be halted immediately.
CNET reports that the judges "would not order TSA to immediately halt the full-body screening," but instead told the agency it is expected to "promptly to proceed in a manner consistent with this opinion."
So not an outright ban, more a Four Loko-type warning. Like: If you don't heed our better judgment, you will be taken down by an angry mob, then probably sent to jail forever.
Pushed along by an irate, violated public (and most definitely the infamous Bikini Girl, our favorite L.A. protester ever), the decision comes harsh and early. The TSA body-scanner lawsuit was only filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center six months ago, in February.
During proceedings, EPIC uncovered all sorts of atrocious government documents, including ones that revealed the "federal agency's plans to expand the use of these systems at railways, stadiums, and elsewhere," and others showing the scanners were never properly tested for radiation.
Within our own conspiracy theory, we're suspicious the scanners are part of a larger, insanely terrifying federal-agency movement to identify people using biometrics -- where nothing is private and everyone is trackable, under a "War on Terror" pretense.
But thankfully, as of today, this porny leg of the operation has been immobilized (and Bikini Girl will have to find herself a hot new cause). Thanks much, your honors!

The Late Heath Ledger Directed a Just-Released Rap Video
The Australian-born, London-based rapper decided to hold off on releasing the video because he didn't feel comfortable doing so after Heath died. N'FA says:
"Friends and his family said it needed to be seen. Heath loved it... Heath loved the song, and wanted to make a video that artistically married itself to the energy of the track, to indulge listeners and viewers alike."Ledger came up with the dark concept in his garage, just a short while before his untimely death in January of 2008. But this isn't a traditional chicks in bikinis booty shaking rap video.
You'll definitely spot Joker references with the white makeup, bow ties, and top hats, and we can't help but think of the White Stripes a little bit, with all the red, white, and black color schemes. As an added bonus, N'FA's floating head makes the video downright creepy -- but in a cool way.
See the music video for "Cause an Effect" after the jump, and tell us, do you think Heath missed his calling in rap video directing?

Rio Acai Bowl Epidemic Strikes Apple A Day
But this is a different incarnation of the berry. Frozen, unprocessed acai from a company called Nativo is the base of a dish that defies classification. (Our best attempt is to call it a frozen fruit pudding.) The other ingredients are simply bananas and apple juice.
It's blended in a food processor, served in a huge bowl, and topped with banana slices for $10 a pop. Granola is a usual add-on, and costs just a dollar. It's common to eat acai this way in Rio de Janeiro, according to Mario Levinsohn, a native of Brazil who studies economics here in Miami. He was at the Apple A Day counter eating his first of three huge bowls of the stuff when I walked in. Three! At his elbows were two friends, both of whom were also indulging in Rio bowls.
"I love the taste. This is the traditional way we have acai in Rio," Levinsohn said. "I've eaten this every day ever since I was a little boy."
"It's got eight times the antioxidant properties of blueberries," his friend chimed in between spoonfuls. The superfruit does have rich amino acid and fatty acid profiles, and is said to offer a host of health benefits, including the ones mentioned at the top of this article.
Apple A Day started getting Nativo's pure, raw acai product and offering the Rio acai bowl about three months ago. Employees say they can't keep the stuff in stock.
"A lot of Brazilians come in and have it every day, but then they tell their co-workers, and they start coming in too. That's why I call it the epidemic," said Apple A Day employee Alejandro Llamozas, who also says he eats a bowl daily. "You start to feel bad if you don't have it," he said, although he denied that the dish bore any similarity to crack cocaine.
Based on my own very unscientific research, I would have to agree that lust for these cold, gelatinous purple bowls seems to be viral. When I spoke to a few South Beach dwelling acquaintances about them after my visit to Apple A Day, an uncannily large portion of them had either already been in for one or had heard about them.
So is it really that spectacular? Obviously, I had to find out firsthand.
First, I was surprised to find that it wasn't very sweet. It had a creamy texture and a pleasant, mild taste. The granola and banana topping made the food seem more dessert-like, but if I were to order it again, I think I would forgo the granola (even though it was delicious) to avoid the added fat and sugar and reap the unadulterated health benefits. It may have been a psychosomatic response, but I will say that I felt an energy lift after I finished my bowl.
I thought the portion size was generous, and found it surprising that Levinsohn could sit and literally eat bowl after bowl of the stuff. The staff at Apple A Day informed me that three was his usual daily intake. I guess it's a Brazilian thing, and an expensive one at that. At the rate he's eating, he's spending $900 a month on the beloved Brazilian breakfast food.
You can get a supersized superfruit bowl of your own for $10 at Apple A Day, if you're willing to risk acquiring a healthy but potentially costly new addiction. The shop also sells packets of the frozen acai puree for $6.49 in case you'd rather use it to make smoothies at home.

Few weeks ago, I release the version 1.3 of the LINQ to SharePoint DSL Extension. In this version, I introduced a new feature to generate automatically a repository layer pattern from a LINQ to SharePoint data model. You can find 3 tutorials about this feature in my previous post:
This generator is only a T4 file (TT), and this file can generate automatically in Visual Studio some code. It means that it's really easy to implement your own generator in your projects. If you do that, you can generate anything that you want from a LINQ to SharePoint data model. Your model (l2sp) file could be the input of some code generation. For the next versions, I'm thinking about new TT items to add in the project, like for example a "Repository light pattern" (same pattern but without the helpers methods). If this post, I will try to explain you how to develop your own code generator from a LINQ to SharePoint data model.
Please note that this tutorial is not about the basics of the T4 programmation, if you don't know this technology or if you need more information about it, you can read the MSDN section about Code Generation and T4 Text Templates.
First, you need to understand that all the objects that you manage in your model (lists, content types, enumerations, mapped properties, etc.) are constructed as an object model. It means that you can load in objects an existing data model contained in a L2SP file. In a TT file in Visual Studio, it's really easy thanks to the "DSL directive processor".
For example, create a new LINQ to SharePoint data model in your project if you don't have it (read this tutorial if you need to know how to do that). Now add a new TT file in a Visual Studio 2010 project (right click on the project name, Add and Add new item) :
Click on the Add button.
A new T4 file is created with the following content:
<#@ template debug="false" hostspecific="false" language="C#" #>
<#@ output extension=".txt" #>
You can remark that this text template will generate a text file as output, and that this generated file is attached with your generator:
Now erase all the content of your tt file, and replace it by this new'" #>
Change the value of the "filename=" attribute by the relative path from this file to the l2sp schema that you want to use. Be sure that the path to this file is good, and save your TT file. If the generation is succedded, now the text file has been replaced by a C# file:
Now you are ready to generate what you want from this model. Indeed, the line containing the reference to the L2SP file automatically loaded the content to tranform it in objects in the current context
In fact, the collection is already loaded in your TT context, and you can browse the model elements through the "this.Linq2spModel.Elements" property.
For example, if you want to write in your CS file all the lists contained in a LINQ to SharePoint Data Model, you can write the following'" #>
//This text is generated from a custom TT file//This text contains all the list of the l2sp input file:<#foreach (BaseMappingElement element in this.Linq2spModel.Elements){ if (element is List) { List list = element as List; string listName = list.Name; string sharePointListName = list.MappedListName;#>//Detected list entity called '<#=listName#>' mapped to the SharePoint list '<#=sharePointListName#>' <# }}#>
For my model, the result of this template file is:
To conclude, it's easy to implement some generators from an input LINQ to SharePoint model. This tip can help you to generate anything you want from elements contained in a schema. A complete class documentation about the object model of the L2SP content will be available online soon.
If you want to write some useful generators and share it with the community, please send it to me, I could be interested to redistribute it by default with the extension.

About the CD:
Paisaje Urbano sings the landscape of Latin American cities and their music genres. The journey starts in Buenos Aires, with Piazzolla’s fiery Libertango, and ends in Rio de Janeiro with Jobim’s cool bossa nova tune Água de beber. Both owe something also to Paris and New York. The tango-vals by Carlos Gardel, Lejana tierra mía, and song recreations in Rapsodia en Bolero and Ódiame take us further north, but also back in time, when guitar trios serenaded young city women under the tropical night. Latin urban styles are not only sophisticated explorations of love and dance. Siembra, written by Rubén Blades, speaks of moral values, and María Suite raises important social issues. Indeed, this Paisaje Urbano mixes haunting memories of a rural past with the vital modernity of city life.
Marysol Quevedo
About the Project:
Paisaje Urbano was conceived by El Taller as an adventurous synthesis of both traditional and urban Latin styles with the techniques of jazz and modern classical music. El Taller is the advanced workshop and performing group of the Latin American Popular Music Ensemble (LAPME), which was created by Indiana University’s Latin American Music Center for the exploration of Latin American music from the perspective of the classical musician. For more information, visit.
Note:
Paisaje Urbano was released at the LAMC’sFiftieth Anniversary Conference held at Indiana University on October. 19-23, 2011. The Latin American Popular Music Ensemble and El Taller performed a concert in Auer Hall at Indiana University on November 30, 2011, at 8 p.m., as the official release concert of the recording.

Urban Meyer says he absolutely will return in 2011by Jason Lieser
Florida coach Urban Meyer casually mentioned Monday that he intends to be back for the 2011 season. He reiterated that much more clearly after today’s practice.
“100 percent,” he said. “Absolutely.”
Asked what would get in the way of that plan, Meyer answered, “nothing.”
Meyer’s future at Florida will always be in question due his past health issues and the lure of other jobs. While Meyer has never shown legitimate interest in the NFL, if Notre Dame or Ohio State needs a coach in the near future, he would be an obvious candidate with ties to both schools.
Health problems pushed him to resign last December, but he changed his mind the next day and opted for a leave of absence instead. Meyer, 46, said in June he was diagnosed with esophageal spasms and could remedy the issue by eating better, exercising more and taking medication.
After this season, Meyer has five seasons and $20 million left on his current contract. Athletic director Jeremy Foley said earlier this season he hopes Meyer is with the Gators another decade.
“The head coach will be back next year,” Meyer said Monday. “I mean, I can’t say that. I hope I am. I want to do the best I can to get this thing back to the elite level, which we all expect.”

Breakingviews
Juilliard improves tone of China’s urbanisation
By John Foley
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.
The tone of China’s frantic urbanisation may be changing for the better. The Juilliard School, one of the best known U.S. music and fine arts colleges, has picked the city of Tianjin for a new institute. The host city is unlikely to be motivated only by a love of the performing arts, but it matters little so long as China’s urban jungle gets more liveable.
It’s not hard to see why Juilliard picked Tianjin. The city will offer the U.S. school a brand new campus rent free, according to a person familiar with the situation. At present the new site, in the wannabe financial centre of Yujiapu, is an hour’s drive from Tianjin. But high-speed railway lines should cut that leg to mere minutes, making Beijing also accessible within an hour or so.
Financially, that could make it a big win. The campus should be in easy reach of a formidable population of rising middle classes. Greater China already supplies around a tenth of Juilliard’s U.S. music students. Classical music is hot: a fraught Juilliard audition even makes an appearance in Amy Chua’s controversial parental memoir “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother”.
Tianjin’s motives may not be purely artistic either. Big cities are clamouring for Western trophies to show their global credentials. Think NYU’s Shanghai campus, due to open next year – or the signings of international soccer players Dario Conca and Dider Drogba to Chinese teams.
While there’s room for discord – Chinese President Hu Jintao has complained Western influences are too prevalent in the media – it should be minor. By avoiding theatre and dance, Juilliard shouldn’t fall foul of China’s censors, and by not offering formal degrees, it also won’t need to worry about the equivalence of qualifications. The school is sticking to what it knows too – there’ll be violin lessons, but no-one will be studying the erhu any time soon.
China is building cities at an alarming rate, around 20 a year, and should account for 38 percent of the global increase in urban floor space between 2010 and 2015, according to McKinsey. That’s a lot of sprawl. Any idea for making city living more harmonious deserves an audience.

All of this is true. But when I interviewed Prokhorov in Moscow a few days ago, I realized that it missed the most important point — what Prokhorov’s candidacy, and the man himself, tells us about the battle raging today inside the Russian governing elite.
When people take to the streets to challenge their regimes, particularly in societies that had been dismissed as apathetic, the most exciting story is the protesters. Many of them are fresh faces, and they can be painted in the idealistic colors of the outsider.
The opposition is certainly important — and it usually also has the virtue of being right. But the fate of the protest movement is very often decided not on the raucous streets where the opposition marches, but in the grim offices where the governing establishment decides how it will respond and how it can hang on to the loot it acquired while in power.
That was the case in the Soviet Union 20 years ago, when three career Communist Party officials gathered in a hunting resort in Belarus to sign the death warrant of the regime that created them. It was true of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which was led by a man who had served as prime minister and central bank chief for the president he was defying. And it was decisive last year in Egypt, where Hosni Mubarak lost the support of the military.

It’s the year of Tiger in the Lunar calendar. JP Morgan Asset management says the Tiger year opens with a bang only to peter out with a whimper — it is a year of fluctuating fortunes with people doing dramatic things, often on the spur of the moment.
“In short, it is a year of massive change, but it can also be a year to inject new life into a losing cause,” the asset manager says.
Here are some events that happened in previous Tiger years, listed by JPM:
1950: The (then) USSR claimed to have developed the atomic bomb, while the Korean War began with the North invading the South.
1962: Typhoon Wandda unleashed havoc in Hong Kong, while a border dispute escalated into the Sino-Indian war.
1974: A record number of tornadoes in the U.S., the IRA bombing of the UK parliament and the sudden resignation of Richard Nixon as the U.S. president at the height of the Watergate investigation

Call for Donations: Help us Reach our Goal in Support of Skype for Peace
11/01/2012 in Big Blog by andys
Do you think technology can bring positive change to the world? At Skype, we’re driven by the notion that our work makes the lives of our users better by helping make communication as easy and accessible to everyone as possible.
This idea is backed by our strong feeling that it’s important to seek new ways to give back to both our users and the local communities we’re a part of. For the past three years, we’ve contributed by providing Skype technology and instruction on how to use it to organizations focused on education, world peace efforts and humanitarian aid.
As a part of these efforts, we are honored to join together with consumers, non-governmental organizations and corporations including Microsoft, Unilever, JCPenney and many more around the world to be a founding partner of #GivingTuesday, a national day of giving in the U.S dedicated to raising funds and awareness for important causes everywhere.
As part of Skype’s founding partner role in Giving Tuesday we are happy to support Skype for Peace. With Skype’s help, Peace One Day was able to create the Peace One Day Global Education Resource, a set of 15 interactive, student-centered classroom lesson plans exploring issues such as anti-bullying, the United Nations and great peacemakers. The lesson plans connect classrooms around the world using Skype video calling to discuss peace efforts and methods of non-violent conflict resolution.
The Peace One Day Global Education Resource is already being used by classrooms in 193 countries, but we feel that this isn’t enough. Our hope is that we can inspire the world to give together and raise money to eventually make the resource available to every teacher around the globe.
Help us give the power to bring about world peace to the next generation and make the world a better place this #GivingTuesday: please visit to donate now.

Obama is right to keep America's nuclear weapons trained on Iran
Ahmadinejad greets his supporters in the city of Oroumieh today (Photo: EPA)
The hardline regime of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would do well to take note of U.S. President Barack Obama's carefully-worded caveat about the conditions under which America might use its devastating stockpile of nuclear weapons.
In his Nuclear Posture Review, Mr Obama stresses that the role of America's nuclear arsenal is to deter nuclear attacks on the U.S. and its allies, and rules out the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries, even if they were to attack the U.S. with non-conventional weapons, such as chemical or biological devices.
But he makes an important exception with regard to both Iran and North Korea. While stating that he would refrain from launching nuclear attacks against countries that have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, this constraint only applies to those countries that are in compliance with the NPT, which both North Korea and Iran are most certainly not.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad might think he can drum up domestic support by denouncing Mr Obama's policy as that of a "cowboy", but he would do well to give its implications serious consideration. The West is heading for a fresh confrontation with Iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment programme, with a new round of sanctions likely to be implemented in the next few weeks.
But if Iran continues to defy world opinion and presses ahead with its attempts to build an atom bomb, it could easily find itself in the target sights of America's nuclear technicians.

The BBC's tawdry Jubilee coverage was the inevitable result of our increasingly infantile culture
How are we to understand the colossal tawdriness of the BBC’s coverage of the river pageant? It must be seen against the backdrop of a national and general infantilisation of our culture.
The rot starts at the junior school. The child is driven there because of our hysterical obsession with paedophiles. There is not the same programme of competitive sports and field trips as in the past – partly because the very idea of competition contravenes the prevailing ideology, but also because the absurd and tyrannical health and safety regulations discourage school trips for fear the teachers will be sued in case of accident.
The emotional nurturing of our children has been ruined too. The teacher is not allowed to chastise them to deter persistent naughtiness. He dare not suggest that there is an objective difference between right and wrong – because, “everyone must be free to make up their (sic) own mind”. What mind? Worse, he can’t hug them and cuddle them when they’re upset or sad. I was at a livery dinner with a bright young head of sport in a prep school and he said restrictions on teachers now make effective teaching of contact sports all but impossible. He said, “when teaching how to tell the time, the answer to the question, ‘what time is it when the big hand is on the little hand?’ is ‘it’s time to arrest the maths teacher’.”
What chance for our children in a society that has wilfully demoralised and infantilised itself? Fifteen years ago, Digby Anderson and I produced a volume of essays on the sentimentalisation of society. We got death-threats. I wanted to follow this up with another book on the infantilisation of society. For one reason and another we didn’t get round to it and now I think I have missed the boat. Things are too far gone. The culture we inhabit and promote is both babyish and narcissistic. Listen on the bus or train to anyone under the age of twenty-five: “It’s like, I was like…I went, like… Like, I was, like.”
I thought I’d seen everything. Then I came across Facebook. Grown men and women, professional people in their 20s and 30s make electronic images of themselves and declare to anyone who cares to switch on their laptop that their chief interest is “partying and fun things.” They advertise that their status is that they are “currently in a relationship.” Then they display mugshots of their friends like some bizarre catalogue of an institution for the criminally insane. People who display this combination of self-regard and baby-talk ought to be sectioned. That’s the lot of us, actually,

A new study says good-looking politicians get put on TV more often than the ugly ones, and it includes this bit of bonus research: Tennessee’s own (and frequent cable TV guest) Rep. Marsha Blackburn has been rated as Congress’s most attractive member.
The researchers from Israel asked college students — perhaps the world’s shrewdest arbiters of attractiveness — to rate all of the members of Congress outside of leadership, with Blackburn beating out the legitimately handsome South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Florida Rep. Connie Mack. Researchers then figured out how often each member showed up on television and determined the hotties got more airtime.
“The effect of attractiveness on news coverage, the study found, was greater than the effect of tenure in office, or bill sponsorship,” the New York Times said in a write-up of the study. “Frequency of news releases had no discernible effect on news media appearances.”
Now, Blackburn does seem to get on TV a lot, and another factor could have worked in her favor. Researchers said members of Congress who “espoused more extreme ideologies” were also favored, and whether you see her as extreme or not, Blackburn is not shy about sponsoring hot-button legislation. Some recent examples include the STRIP Act, a bill targeting the Transportation Security Administration that Blackburn shrewdly filed during the holiday travel season, and her sparring with the Federal Communications Commission over Internet regulation. (Working against Blackburn, however, were TV producers’ preference for Congressmen who are male, black or from a larger state.)
Radio and newspapers were immune to the wiles of attractiveness. Those of us in the ugly branches of journalism were no more likely to quote pretty people than other members of Congress, researchers found.
Our items are never shallow, it would seem.

When his first start at center since 2010, Velasco got good reviews for his performance in the preseason opener at Seattle. Said offensive coordinator Chris Palmer: “I thought he played very well for the first time out.”
Hasselbeck and Velasco had talked about the challenge of the center mastering the silent count prior to the game, but that went smoothly for the most part. The Seattle environment even provided a better-than-usual preseason test for Velasco, as CenturyLink Field was noisy and nearly filled to capacity.
“We had a little hiccup there early in the game,” Palmer said of the silent count, “but after that we were fine.”
Palmer wasn’t as happy with the overall play of the first-team line, especially in terms of the run game. Chris Johnson, for instance, was held to eight yards on five carries.
“I’d say obviously we’re not happy with our run game and what we did, especially with the first (group),” Palmer said. “I think it was more communication than it was anything else. You have to give the back a chance to get going and sometimes we didn’t give him a chance to get going. Again, it’s preseason and we’ll continue to get better.”
The contest was the first for the newly aligned interior, which featured Steve Hutchinson at left guard, Velasco at center and Leroy Harris at right guard.
“For us in the run game, it was pretty sloppy,” Harris said. “Not individually, but sloppy overall. We’ve got lots of technique stuff to clean up. There was a little bit of penetration here and there that messed a play up. We have to clean that stuff up all around.”

The cheating scandals in Atlanta and Long Island that rocked the educational establishment last year appear to be spreading. In the past, the tendency has been to view these scandals as isolated incidents—examples of moral failures on the part of individual teachers or school districts. A new study by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, however, refutes this view—the problem of cheating is much more serious and widespread than previously thought. According to the study, which examined test results from the largest school districts in all 50 states, a full six percent (196) have evidence of widespread manipulation of test results. The evidence implicates school districts from Los Angeles to Houston to Baltimore, and the scandals, if true, could impact tens of thousands of students nationwide.
It is certainly possible that some of these anomalous results are just that—anomalies with a perfectly valid explanation behind them. But it is exceedingly unlikely that all—or even the majority—of them are; cheating is clearly a serious problem in a growing number of American school districts.
This speaks to a serious failure, both moral and systemic, in our education system. The moral issues are obvious—teachers face many difficulties in their jobs, but there is absolutely no excuse for fabricating test scores and lying about student’s achievements. The widely distributed nature of these allegations shows that this is a serious moral problem and not simply the work of a few bad apples.
Yet perhaps more serious is what this shows about the weakness of the big box model in American education. In today’s bureaucratic and centralized public schools, parents often find that they have little knowledge of the teachers who are entrusted with their children’s education. Taxpayers are frustrated: schools seem to be getting more and more money, but old problems persist and in some ways get worse. Partly to respond to these concerns, districts try to assess both teachers schools and states and federal authorities try to assess everything going on locally under their jurisdiction.
These evaluation process are almost always clumsy, bureaucratic and deeply flawed. Fraud often results; teachers and administrators resent what feels like the unfairness and arbitrary nature of crude and one sided evaluation measures. With both funding for their students and their own professional standing potentially at risk, the temptation to cheat isn’t always resisted.. Big box schools that can’t monitor teaching effectively, and where teachers and administrators cheat are no place for this country’s kids.

Many Hands Tend the Food Safety Net
Undersecretary Kevin Concannon meets with Sisters of the Holy Family, an order of nuns based in New Orleans.
When a newspaper reporter asked me recently, “What can I tell our readers about the USDA programs,” I told her: “Most of what USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service does is through others.”
As I travel throughout the country, I see how different organizations come together to carry out our mission of putting food on the table for those in need. In concert with FNS’ 15 nutrition assistance programs, hundreds of organizations are working hard every day to create the safety net against hunger that protects Americans. Without fanfare and with little public notice, coalitions of non-profits, religious organizations and groups of volunteers are often the first line of defense against hunger. Read more »

I think James Casebere is stalking me.
That’s my house in “Landscape with House (Dutchess County, NY) #8.” Sure, my house isn’t in New York — it’s in Fargo — but he isn’t fooling me with that title.
James Casebere, Landscape with Houses (Dutchess County, NY) #8, 2010. Framed digital chromogenic print mounted to Dibond paper: 69 3/4 x 86 1/4 inches.
See it? It’s the house in the foreground, all by its lonesome on the street with driveways to nowhere. It’s the only house without window shades; the one without pigment that’s fenced in by hedges.
Look. My house cowers below the looming houses on the hill; those big colorful houses with above ground pools, TV antennae, and playgrounds. And above them, a stately blue house presides at the top of the hill. Me, I’m at the bottom — colorless — watching the sun set behind the other houses, blocked from a forest of color by my betters. It’s rather sad – this exploitation of my life and house for art.
But wait!
Take another look: See how there are no driveways visible at the bigger houses, how their curtains keep them insulated, how their pools, barbecue sets, and TVs keep them tethered to their homes?
I have mobility. My home has the only vehicle in sight in this unpeopled world. I have a bike. I have a house that spills onto the sidewalk, connected to a road that leads to the great unknown. I moved to the Twin Cities from Fargo to escape this life — to become something more than the value of my house size — to connect to culture by going to events like the Lifelike exhibition at the Walker Art Center.
But then I turn a corner in the gallery and James Casebere is shoving my old life right back in my face. And I nearly trip over a bronze sleeping bag as I back away.

Fantasy—Once the Realm of the Nerdiest of Nerds—Is Going Mainstream.
Kitty Litter
The billionaires for wealthcare took over the sidewalk outside the richy-rich Multnomah Athletic Club—Portland's only gym with sanctions for "conservative" dress code violations—this morning, to protest about a meeting inside the club of Oregon health insurance chief executives.
"They're discussing health reform. I'm not joking," said Betsy Dillner, with Healthcare for America Now, which organized the protest. "Or at least, they're in there discussing their talking points about it."
A sergeant from central precinct swung by, introducing himself and asking "no arrests today?" The club wanted the protesters to stay off the property, on the sidewalk, he said. And no blocking of the entrance. That appeared to be just fine with them, as long as the officer would let them keep their billions. Would he let them keep their billions, I wondered? Evidently, he would.
"I'm just so upset that people are threatening our income," said Inde Nile, one of the billionaires. "I can no longer afford a full time mechanic, so my Jaguar is in the shop."
"And I'm about to lose my seventh vacation home," said Mora Yorbucks. "Why aren't these greedy poor people just buying insurance?" "I was glad to hear that 45,000 Americans are dying each year because they don't have insurance," she continued. "I mean, what are they doing for me?"
The Mercury asked the MAC representative if it could get in touch with a representative of the health insurance industry meeting for comment about the protest.
"I'm sorry, because it's a private club, I can't let you in," she said. Which is probably a better quote than I could have got from a spokesman, regardless.
It costs $4,900 for an individual to join the MAC, if you can beat the "lottery" system, although of course, there's an evidently much-needed affirmative action program, if you're not white.

The two most important reasons why Rainforests are important in preventing global warming are:
1. Tropical rainforests are one of the world’s primary carbon sinks as they draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), through photosynthesis and store it in biomass and other carbon stocks. In other words, they absorb and store massive amounts of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
2. Deforestation is considered the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions (approx. 20%) after the burning of fossil fuels. This is more than the emissions from the entire global transport sector and larger than the annual emissions of the USA or China (IPCC, 2007).
Tropical deforestation has a particularly strong effect on emissions because trees in tropical forests typically hold about 50% more carbon per hectare than trees outside the tropics. Tropical forests store 120-400 tonnes of carbon per hectare therefore burning them contributes huge quantities of CO2 emissions.
In aggregate, there is more carbon stored in rainforests than there is in the atmosphere. Just one day of tropical forest emissions from deforestation is equal to 12.5 million people flying from London to New York (Forest NOW - GCP, 2008)
As a result, tackling the issue of tropical deforestation will be essential if the world is to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to below 2º degrees Celsius this century and avoiding catastrophic climate change as concluded by IPCC.

Impressions, Jane Smiley, John Green, Lurlene McDaniel, Personal, Series, The Fault in our Stars, Thesis, Young Adult
Dear Kelsey,
When I was writing my thesis, I was obsessed with reading lists of “Books that Changed the World” in an effort to find some solid idea of why fiction matters. And that’s not to suggest that literature demands justification or that it needs some larger function in order to be important. I think questions like “So what are you doing with your English major” can be profoundly thoughtless because simply in the asking, they devalue knowledge as a pursuit. I did not need to go into publishing because I was an English major; studying something that was important and meaningful to me was (and should be) enough.
So my thesis was never intended to be defensive—I did not want justify the discipline or the time I devoted (and still devote) to reading; I was just curious why. Why did reading become one of the biggest factors in the person I am and am still becoming? What drew me to books, rather than movies or sports or theater?
And obviously, these are not really the kinds of questions one can definitively answer—and certainly not in a way that makes a tenable argument. But I still wondered, and still spent the time I should have spent researching on this nebulous and quixotic side quest.
So when the books and articles about “Literature that Changed the World” would always include books like Mein Kampf and On the Origin of Species (which, yes, obviously changed the world) it was not really what I was looking for. In the first place, they weren’t fiction. Even though I enjoy nonfiction (I’m working at an academic publisher, for goodness sake!), I would never suggest that nonfiction is as important to me as novels. And in the second place, I wanted something more individualized; not sweeping books that changed scientific study and the actions of nations, but the books that—in Jane Smiley’s terms—shift one’s perspective.
As you know, I ended up reshaping my project entirely. Frustrated by my lack of answers (and the growing insistence of my thesis advisor) I stopped looking for the nagging whys or hows, but instead to way these books make people reach out, build communities, and connect with each other. This turned into an extended study on blogging, vlogging, forums, tumblr, fanfiction, and general expressions of fandom (Of which this blog is a direct result). But despite my interest in the subject and participation in these communities, I never really developed a conclusion that satisfied me—probably because I was not-so-stealthily trying to use these public venues to find the original answers I’d been looking for.
Anyway, I gave blood today, and as I was sitting in the chair waiting in horrified anxiety to be stuck with a needle (it’s never all that bad, but I will never stop freaking out about it), it finally hit me that although what I was looking for was about books, I would never find the answers in them.
I am terrified of needles, hate even the thought of pain, and yet every 6 weeks I’ll volunteer for both. And its not because I like to face my fears or because giving blood gives me a warm charitable sensation. It’s because I have to.
It’s for Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. For Jenny Crawford, Lacey Duval, Amanda Burdick, and Katie O’Rourke. It’s because I read a lot of books growing up and they shaped me into someone who remembers crying in my bed about the death of a fictional someone that may as well have been someone real.
According to the Red Cross posters, donated blood can save 1-3 lives. Maybe that fact alone would have been enough for me to donate, but when I lean back in those chairs and nervously eye the needle about to puncture my skin, I can say with 100% certainty that I’m never thinking about statistics.
Books can change the world. And not just in the sweeping way of history and monumental change, but in the tiny shifts of perspective that allow me, every 6 weeks, to face down a hollow needle.
Love,
Kelsey said:
Love this post. You’re right: novels affect us more than we realize and all those little shifts in outlook have the ability to change our values and actions just as much as “The Origin of Species.” Why oh why hasn’t there been a study done on the influence of pleasure reading on values, brain patterns, and actions? I want to see that.
Maggie said:
…I tried!
Jenny said:
Mags you inspired me to give blood today but my iron was to low! I tried for you! Love Jenny
Maggie said:
Jenny, that’s awesome!! Even if you are (like our entire family) a little bit anemic
You can always try again though! Or move to a high elevation. Apparently, lack of oxygen makes your body create more red blood cells. And more red blood cells = more iron. …Strictly unbiasedly, I would suggest the second one. I bet we could find a place for you to stay

The information is appalling! How is it possible? I am an internet marketing professional and I want to volunteer my series to any bluegrass artist that would like to market their music on their website. Please contact me at randyfeldman@me.com.
Randy Feldman — all joking aside, we really have no context as to whether these statements represent an appalling circumstance or not. Martin doesn’t say what compositions these checks are for: they could be from incidental music he composed and performed just once on broadcast television, or original music from a long out-of-print LP. Considering that his last album “The Crow” sold rather well, I’m sure he ALSO gets more sizable checks from Harry Fox, and he’s just playing up these ridiculous checks for comedic effect. That said, I loved your work with.

In the Books | by Pat
team sets the foundation."
-- Charlie Weis, signing day, 2-1-06
Links 'o plenty about the newest recruiting class -- the first batch of players where Charlie had a full year to work the recruiting trail:
• the Official ND Press Release(So good, I'll link it again -- the press conference is an especially good read.)
• Charlie Weis Press Conference Transcript (and podcast)
• the South Bend Tribune - ND Recruit Profiles
• Irish Eyes: Offensive Signees and Defensive Signees
• Irish Illustrated: Irish Sign Top 10 Class
• Blue & Gold Illustrated: Class of 2006
What we said then. Here's the breakdown of the offensive and defensive players, complete with links back to the BGS posts we wrote when they verbally committed.
Offense
QB - Zach Frazer, Demetrius Jones
RB - James Aldridge, Munir Prince, Luke Schmidt
WR - Barry Gallup, Richard Jackson, Robby Parris, George West
TE - Konrad Reuland
OL - Matt Carufel, Eric Olsen, Chris Stewart, Bartley Webb, Dan Wenger, Sam Young
Defense
DE - John Ryan, Kallen Wade
DT - Paddy Mullen
LB - Morrice Richardson, Toryan Smith
CB - Raeshon McNeil, Darrin Walls
S - Sergio Brown, Leonard Gordon, Jashaad Gaines
K - Ryan Burkhart
Also, take a look back at Travels With Charlie, the whirlwind recruiting trip last winter that really got the ball rolling.
Teammates. Notre Dame has 3 pairs of high school teammates making their way to South Bend this year. Munir Prince and Paddy Mullen both hail from DeSmet in Missouri. Dan Wenger and Sam Young both are St. Thomas Aquinas students in Fort Lauderdale, FL. And Robby Parris and John Ryan are both enrolled at St. Ignatius in Cleveland, OH.
Related. Sergio Brown is from the same high school as Illinois basketball player Dee Brown and Michigan State basketball player Shannon Brown, but isn't related to either. However, he is a cousin of newly committed Irish basketball recruit Jonathan Peoples.
Nicknames. The South Bend Tribune once again lists any nicknames a recruit might have. Here's James Aldridge explaining his nickname, Moose. "Ever since I started football, I've been known as 'Moose. I think it's because I'm such an aggressive runner. I can run around you, but I also don't mind dropping a shoulder, either." Others are a bit more of an inside joke, like Darrin "Teets" Walls or Kallen "I-Robot" Wade. Matt Carufel is..."Matt."
Bonus Babies. So those were the official football scholarship members of the incoming class. However, it appears that Notre Dame will also be bringing in three athletes with the distinction of "preferred walk-on". They'll be under scholarship for another sport, but be allowed to practice with the football team. (However, if they ever get into a game, their scholarship will transfer to the football team and count towards the 85 total team scholarship limit.)
The most notable recruit in this situation is lacrosse player and tight end prospect Will Yeatman. Here's the story we wrote about him when he committted. There are two signing periods in lacrosse and Yeatman did not sign in the early one, so he has not officially signed a letter of intent yet (which is why Weis alluded to Yeatman in his press conference, but could not officially talk about him.)
BGS sez...We conducted a little email roundtable about this recruiting class over the past couple of days. Everyone to a man agrees that this is a fantastic class, both in terms of quality and depth. It's an important class, too, in terms of immediate impact: a couple of these guys might start right away, and as for the rest we're filling major holes in the depth chart, and we'll have better talent and better numbers in case disaster strikes. Even at defensive tackle, where we missed on our biggest recruit (Gerald McCoy, who opted to stay in-state and go to Oklahoma), we have some numbers there (Mullen and possibly Ryan), so it's not an unmitigated vacuum like the '01 class, where we missed on Shaun Cody and had almost nothing to fall back on.
Some more chatter from the peanut gallery...
Biggest get. Teds: James Aldridge. Aldridge is precisely the sort of "football-first" recruit that ND has consistently missed out on over the past decade, and landing him early in the process -- and beating Carroll and SC to the punch to do so -- certainly turned some heads both within and outside the program and represented a harbinger of things to come. Symbolic of ND's return to the plateau of truly elite programs on the recruiting front. Sean: Six offensive linemen. Regardless of who we have at the skill positions, none of it would matter without these six guys. O-line had reached a crisis stage and Charlie got the depth chart replenished in one fell swoop. Pat: also Aldridge. After failing to sign a single running back last year -- and when's the last time you can remember ND doing that? -- Weis needed to land a good one and it certainly sounds like he did with Aldridge. The fact that he's already enrolled and working out with the team means he may even get to see some carries in the fall. As good as Darius Walker is on his own, it's always better when a team has a stable of fresh legs to wear down opposing defenses. Mike: Darrin Walls. Prior to his injury, he was widely considered the top corner in the country. Jay: Sam Young. He's the best player in the class, the best at his position in the country, it came all the way down to the last week, and he picked ND over Southern Cal on national TV. In addition to his being a blue chip talent, his signing was a fantastic way to wrap up the class and springboard us into next year.
Biggest miss. Gerald McCoy, in a landslide.
Class Sleeper. Mike: Morrice Richardson. I seem to remember Richardson posting the fastest shuttle time at the Athens, GA Nike camp. The kind of quickness, coupled with his size, could give us some nice versatility that our linebackers have often lacked. Pat: Luke Schmidt. For all the press Aldridge gets (just look at my "Biggest Get") people tend to forget that it was Schmidt, not Aldridge that won the Gatorade player of the year award in Indiana. Seeing as how Weis loves versatile players, I'm sure he's going to find all kinds of uses for a fullback with tight end size: blocking for Aldridge, lining up behind Schwapp on the goaline, catching screens and bearing down on 5'8" corners. I expect Schmidt to be a vital piece of the ND offense in the coming years. Sean: Robby Parris. Jeff Samardzija 2.0. Teds: Kallen Wade. Lots of good candidates here, but Wade seems like the sort of player for whom an early commitment, natural athletic ability and positional need may conspire to thrust him into the spotlight as an unexpected gem sooner rather than later. Comparisons between Wade and Justin Tuck have some merit.
Feel free to add your own 2¢.
(By the way, extra-special thanks to Jimmy who put together the opening banner for this post. Bonus points if you can name each player from their picture in the montage.)

“Blue Ocean Fellows will boost our ability to be a thought-leading group, small in size and big in influence,” says Institute founder, Carl Safina.
Working independently but inter-dependently as well, Blue Ocean Fellows will create articles, opinion pieces, videos, tutorials and other materials, greatly expanding our reach.
We’re very excited to welcome our first three Blue Ocean Fellows: author and essayist Paul Greenberg and shark experts Dr. Demian Chapman and Debra Abercrombie.
Paul Greenberg is the author of the James Beard Award-winning New York Times bestseller Four Fish: The Future of the Last Wild Food and other books, and a regular contributor to the New York Times Magazine, New York Times Sunday Book Review and the New York Times Opinion page. He has also written for National Geographic, GQ, The Times of London, Vogue and many other publications. In the last five years, he has been both a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellow and a W. K. Kellogg Foundation Food and Society Policy Fellow.A guest and commentator on national public radio programs including “Fresh Air” and “All Things Considered,” Mr. Greenberg is also a fiction writer. His 2002 novel, Leaving Katya, was a Barnes & Noble “Discover Great New Writers” selection. Greenberg lectures widely on issues of ocean sustainability at diverse venues including the United States Supreme Court, Monterey Bay Aquarium and Culinary Institute of America. He has lectured and reported extensively overseas, with assignments in Russia, Ukraine, France, the Caucasus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, the West Bank/Gaza, and many other global locations. His book, Four Fish, has been translated into Spanish, Italian, German and Korean, and is soon to be published in Greek, Russian and Mandarin.
Dr. Demian Chapman takes a DNA sample from a nearly 15-foot blunt nose, six-gill shark in the Bahamas. Photo by Sean Williams, Cape Eleuthera Institute.
Dr. Demian Chapman is a shark geneticist helping small, island nations strengthen their ability to identify illegal shark fishing and enforce recently established shark sanctuaries. As a Fellow, Chapman will co-author influential articles, videos and blogs with Safina to establish better support for shark conservation worldwide.
Chapman’s research expertise lies in molecular biology and telemetry tracking, which he integrates to address research questions about how sharks and rays reproduce and disperse. He is investigating how shark reproduction and movements impact population dynamics, genetic diversity and geographic structure and the implications for conservation.
Dr. Chapman is the author of numerous peer-reviewed scientific research articles, and currently manages field research projects on sharks in Belize, the Bahamas, New Zealand and Florida. Chapman’s DNA lab is located near the Blue Ocean Institute office on Long Island, NY, in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University.
Debra Abercrombie tags, measures and takes samples from a female bull shark. Photo by Sean Williams, Cape Eleuthera Institute.
Debra Abercrombie is a marine biologist and shark expert, Debra is one of the discoverers of the fact that Chinese trade names for shark fins have high concordance with particular species. This means that visual fin identification is possible, even for threatened and endangered shark species. Abercrombie worked with the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement to genetically identify fins from prohibited shark species that were confiscated from commercial fishing operations in the Atlantic Ocean. She has published peer-reviewed papers on the genetic identification of CITES listed and proposed shark species (white shark, hammerheads) and the global fiind trade in leading journals such as Conservation Biology and Conservation Genetics.

Squid, Market (Ika) (calamari)
Market Squid are short-lived and can withstand intensive fishing pressure at their spawning grounds off the California coast. But they are vulnerable to large-scale changes in the environment driven by El Nino Southern Oscillation events.
Accurate estimates of Market Squid abundance elude fisheries biologists and managers, which makes management of the population difficult at best.

Make a Difference
This is the good news — it’s not too late to save the oceans. There are constructive and very real things that you can do to be part of the solution.
Here are 15 ways to make a difference. Maybe you have other ideas? Please share.
15 WAYS TO SAVE THE OCEANS
4. Be an Ocean Advocate
10. Eat Sustainable Seafood
11. Choose Sustainable Seafood
1. Head for the Beach
Spending time in, on or near the ocean is a great way to gain the inspiration that will ultimately fuel your actions. Get to know this world of vitality, mystery, remarkable beauty, and untold promise.
Tell everyone about your love of the oceans. Don’t be shy. Personal testimonials — maybe your first ocean visit or a memorable sailing trip — can be extremely powerful and a motivation to others. Tell people in your social circles, places of worship, schools, and neighborhoods what’s going on with the oceans. It is a direct and satisfying way to inspire others.
A great way to save the oceans is to directly support organizations like Blue Ocean who have made it their business to understand current issues and promote solutions.
At Blue Ocean Institute, a contribution of any size is greatly appreciated.
We are a small yet influential group and your gift goes a long way toward saving the ocean. Using science, art, and literature we seek to inspire a deeper connection with nature in everyone touched by an ocean. Your donation helps us show how nature, community, the economy, and prospects for peace are all intertwined.
4. Be an Ocean Advocate
Show your support of efforts big and small, regional to international, to expand marine reserves that protect valuable and threatened marine species and habitats.
Support oceans by learning about related issues, too, like offshore drilling, fisheries management, mercury pollution, wetlands, coastal development, runoff, and marine debris. Be aware of key issues so you can be an informed spokesperson for the seas.
Climate change spells big trouble for ocean life. One of the most important steps you can take is to support clean energy initiatives in your community, region and nation. The measures that need to be taken now to protect the seas and the people who depend on them, depend on you.
Back to Top
Significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions is vital to preserving the life support systems of our planet. This challenge requires action at the individual, community, national, and international levels–we can all play a role.
Take steps to curb your own carbon footprint: make your home more energy efficient, turn off lights when you leave a room, adjust your thermostat, support the smart grid, unplug your appliances when not in use, ride your bike, drive an electric car or a highly fuel efficient car, support clean energy businesses, and encourage action by your local community, religious group, and schools.
There are several organizations with scientifically sound, trusted information about climate change and how we can each make a difference. Here’s a recommended handful: 350.org, Earth Lab, Union of Concerned Scientists, Energy Star, Pew Center
Keep up with the issues. Use Social Media to follow Blue Ocean, Carl Safina and other ocean leaders.
Here’s a great start:
Follow Carl’s Blog and on Twitter and Facebook.
Follow Blue Ocean on Twitter and Facebook.
Set up Google Alerts for the issues that mean the most to you and keep up with the news and scientific updates surrounding current ocean challenges.
Beach clean ups are a good way to get to know your coastal community (or nearest shore), keep garbage out of the ocean and prevent it from re-entering the sea. Clean ups are also a great way to introduce kids to the concept that all drains lead to the ocean.

9. Limit Your Plastic
Limit your use of plastic – there are so many reasons why! Creating new plastic requires the use of fossil fuels. Every year tens of thousands of seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals drown or starve due to entanglement in marine debris, over half of which is from plastic.
Once in the ocean, it is hard to clean up plastic waste. The North Pacific gyre, a whirlpool of debris, is estimated to be twice the size of the continental United States.
It is best to stop it at the source—demand less and less will be produced. You can start by bringing your own bag to the grocery store, use a refillable water bottle, and purchase foods with minimal packaging. Also, ensure proper disposal of wastes including nets and fishing line and support proper waste management practices on land.
10. Choose Sustainable Seafood
Make educated choices when dining in restaurants. More and more chefs are concerned about the seafood they serve. Support these chefs by frequenting restaurants who offer sustainable seafood on their menu. See our fish consumption guidelines and get educated about which fish are from sustainable sources.
11. Buy Sustainable Seafood
Buy sustainable seafood and make your choice as local as possible. (This reduces the carbon footprint of shipping and packaging your seafood). Ask your local fish monger where the fish or shellfish come from, how it was caught, and what species it is. To ensure your seafood purchase is sustainable, use Blue Ocean Institute’s online guide.
Get involved with management of marine areas in your area. Visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and connect with your local fisheries management council. Council sites will provide information about upcoming council meetings and other events in your area.
Avoid buying pet food that contains fish meal and insist that land-based animals like swine be fed land-grown food. The pet food industry uses about 10 percent of the global supply of forage fish. The swine industry consumes 24 percent of fish meal and oil, and the poultry industry takes as much as 22 percent.
The removal of vast quantities of wild forage fish, such as sardines and anchovies, threatens to starve whales, seals, cod and tuna.
All drains lead to the sea. Think twice before using fertilizer and insecticide on your lawn and garden, stop washing your car on the street, be careful what you put down any drain and don’t litter. Preventing chemicals, plastics and pollutants from going into the sea is much easier than getting them back out. Support organic farming and local farms that do not use chemicals.
When on the water, treat it well. If you decide to take a cruise ship vacation, do some research to find the most ocean-friendly cruise line. Be a responsible boater, surfer, canoeist, kayaker, stand up paddle boarder, etc. Never throw anything overboard, and be aware and protective of the marine creatures in the waters around you.

What do you think? Do you know other ways to save the oceans?

One word. Rubberband. Yes, it took me 44 years to realize that wrapping a simple rubberband around the edges of the hanger would help to hold wide-shouldered clothing on a standard hanger. Okay, maybe I didn't care the first 20 years of my life when my clothes ended up in a pile on the closet floor, but after a while it bothered me. I had my lightbulb moment in a thrift store (bless thrift stores everywhere!) who were preventing sliding clothes with rubberbands.
No need to buy fancy fabric hangers. Okay, maybe just a few very cool handmade hangers from indie creatives. And while I would LOVE to have a closet full of artsy hangers, it won't be happening anytime soon given the price. This artist may not actually intend for them to be used in the closet, but I like 'living' with art - so I would definitely try to incorporate them into daily living.
I'm sure my growing collection of clever household tips on Pinterest won't be challenging Hints from Heloise anytime soon, but if you want to have a few 'aha' moments, hop on over to have a look.
Until next time...

Hello Mike,
Thank you for sharing this tip! It has always upset me how the wide cut tops fall down from my hangers when I move them around. I am very curious about how the rubber bands will work when i have quite many of those tricky tops hung in the same row.
And you do have an impressive collection of great pins on Pinterest! I started following quite some boards as they fit perfectly my interests. Thank you for creating these collections!
Have a nice new week! :-)
Laura
You did it again! Why haven't I thought of finding you on Pinterest before??? That art hanger is a great stash-buster idea too
Ok - I've never heard of this rubber band trick! Thanks for this - I shall be fixing up my hangers today! Off to check out more of your tips on Pinterest!

I liked this episode a lot, but the plot was quite generic. The Rockets continued being extremely awesome at least. Loved the awesome Iwane animation too.
What happened in the end? I was too busy fangirling to notice. n_n;;
I laughed, I cried,
I puked a little in my mouth.
Ryuu no Ikari finally worked and sent TRio Blasting off...in jetpacks, of course.
Ranma ½ fan. And I never got into shipping flamewars about it either..

This episode seemed completely forgettable at first, but it really started to stand out from other episodes around the middle.
I wish Team Rocket would be in every episode now. Oh well.

Empire of Dirt Wrap-up Gallery
Here’s one last photo gallery of images from the week in and around the contest. Enjoy…
2008 Empire of Dirt Final Results

Results:
1. Corey Bohan
2. Gary Young
3. Dane Searls
4. Kye Forte
An epic contest has come to a close, and the finals were nothing short of amazing and climatic. After 16 riders went through two finals runs, the four riders to transfer to the “Super Final” were Kye Forte, Dane Searls, Corey Bohan, and Gary Young. The one lap, no crap Super Final saw Kye go first.
Kye’s run consisted of a 360 drop-in to start, followed by a turndown, table, 360 x-up, a 360 turndown, a tailwhip and a one-footed table in the dirt half, a table out of one of the curved walls, and a flair on the quarter. Kye had some trouble towards the end of his run and placed fourth.
Dane was second to go and he dropped in with a one-footed x-up. The rest of his run consisted of a one-footed table, a 360, a no-hander-to-x-up, a tire grab-to-tailwhip, an x-up, an alley-oop table, a no-footed can-can over the spine, an alley-oop x-up on the quarter, a lookback, a tailwhip, a 360 tailwhip, and an x-up-to-table on the last hip. Dane’s strong last section placed him in third.
Corey Bohan skipped the drop-in, but brought it on the top section with a tailwhip, an opposite tailwhip, a 360 nosedive, an x-up, a flair in the dirt half (the only person to do that), a sweet nac-nac on the second dirt pipe hit, an insane no-footed can-can out of the first curved wallride, a cannonball over the spine, a one-footed table, a one-handed table, a nothing, a no-footed can-can tailwhip, and a seatgrab Indian air over the last hip. With a huge variety of tricks, a strong start-to-finish run, and style for miles, Corey’s run was good enough to beat out Gary’s for the win.
Gary’s Super Final run also started off without a trick on the drop-in, but quickly got heated with a 360, an opposite 360, a turndown, and a huge 360 double tailwhip. Gary’s feet blew off of the three-double whip, but he managed to keep it together and fire into the dirt half with an alley-oop lookback and a no-hander. Gary threw an ultra smooth 270 out of the first curved wallride, and after railing through the curved wall section, he blasted a one-footed table over the spine. Not slowing down, a 270 off the quarter hip was followed by a nosewheelie down the the ledge, and a 50/50-to-grizz air off the doubles rail. A euro table on the last hip ended his run, but all said, it wasn’t enough for the win.
Hopefully you were able to watch it live via the Internet as it truly was an amazing contest. I’ll be posting one final photo gallery of photos from the event soon.
Thanks go out to Kye Forte, his brothers Leo and Toby, the course building crew, and Red Bull for a brilliant contest. This one will go down in the history books, for sure. Check back soon for more photos…

2008 Red Bull Empire of Dirt Qualifying Results
Today started off with a little rain and some wind, so there were some slight delays, but despite a mix of everything—rain, sunshine, wind, and clouds—qualifying went off without much of a problem. In practice, Leo Forte and Scott Edgworth had a bad collision, which took out Scott and sent Leo to the hospital for most of the day. Against all odds, Leo came back in time to throw down one run (cold turkey), and rode well enough to make it into the finals. His brother Kye, Mr. Empire of Dirt himself, qualified first with a mix of big air, great variations, smooth riding, and sweet style. The top 16 will compete tomorrow in the finals, with four moving on to the super finals with one run each determining the winner. Below are today’s qualifying results. Check back soon for final results and more photos, and don’t forget to check out the live video streaming (click the link on our homepage to see all the action).

Today was the second day of practice here in England for the 2008 Empire of Dirt contest. Most of the day saw heavy gusts and steady wind, so there wasn’t as much going down as yesterday’s session. A little sheltered from the wind, the middle section of the course saw the most action—typically from the dirt half to the quarter. After today’s practice everyone went to the local trails (Decoy) and some heavy riding was logged in. Lots of tricks and style for hours. I’ll be posting a gallery from the Decoy jam shortly. Tomorrow is qualifying, so stay tuned. For now, here are some photos from today’s practice with a few randoms thrown in…
The 2008 Empire of Dirt contest has kicked off in Newton Abbot, England, and although today was only the first day of practice, the riding was going off. The variety of riders that are here and the diversity of style amongst them is as good as it gets. The course is like nothing else ever built and the riders are absolutely loving it—nothing but smiles all around. Here are two photo galleries, one consisting of course photos and the other is action from the day. Take a walk from top to bottom to see every obstacle and section, then see what the boys were throwing down on their first day of riding.

Point Load into joist

Point Load into joist
I am working on a project to open up my stairs in my 1901 built twin house. My joist run the full with of my house from stone foundation to stone foundation except for around the stairs. There is a 2x12 that runs along the stairs and the joists are level with this and nailed into it. I have a 4x4 under the end if that on both ends both in the basement into cement and on the main floor. My question is if I take out the support at the first step on the first floor and brace it with a 2x6 to carry that load out to a wider point and then down, can I just bring this down onto a joist, or do I need to support under the joist to the basement floor to carry it down again.
It seems like the way they tied them all in with railroad spike looking nails 100 years ago holds it up pretty well, but I'd rather be safe. There was no support under the basement corner when I bought the house and I added one.

Some pictures may help. You can post pictures here by clicking on the add attachment link below the text box in the Post A Reply box. Even with pictures we may not be able to tell what's needed without seeing it in 21, 2012, 09:54 AM

Agreed that a picture would help, but be aware that while lots of us here do have structural knowledge it is not a good idea to get all your structural advice from this board.
From what you have said, you currently have the strongest thing possible with the load on those 2x12's being transferred by bearing directly on posts on a footing. I cannot imagine any case where you could use 2x6 to brace in any direction so that you could remove one or more of those posts. Any header extensions or bracing will need to be at least as strong at the original 2x12.
I would advise you to find someone local to come in and take a look at what you have and what you want to do.

according to this syear's playoffs is not the requirement we think for winning (not my belief) but look at the scores, the Ravens against the Broncos and the 49'ers against the Packers. The league is offense oriented now and the defenses are lagging behind. For most fans that is opposite of ehat we enjoy and want football to be, but the owners want excitiement to sell tickets

Only being a casual player of poker (5 card draw) I did not know what strategy to use when I was dealt a great hand right off the bat (straight). Any advice in this situation?

definitely a GD question. It will depend on your opponents, whether it is a limit or no limit game, how good your hand is and your previous history. If they are betting strongly, you can pretend to be weak and just going along for the ride. If they are tight bettors, a small bet might be the best way to get them along. If you have been bluffing a lot and they know it, a big bet might lead them to think you are bluffing again. If your hand is only moderately strong and unlikely to improve (say 3 or a kind) then I bet as strong as possible to try and knock out as many freeloaders as possible who might fluke a better hand. And poker being what it is, what will work one time will go down badly the next.

But I was dealt a straight. How are the other players going to react when I refuse to take any new cards. What kind of bluff can I use to fake them out. I see another player not take a single new card i worry he has a royal flush to tell you the truth. What to do, what to do???:confused:

Ok...
If you have been dealt a straight, full house or a flush, then bet very high, but... do it slyly. Pick up your hand, look at everyone else, wait a little, look at everyone else again, look at the pot, then bet whatever the limit is. Basically, you've just got to pretend to be bluffing.
If you've been dealt four of a kind, then you have a much easier time of it, because most people will assume that if you only change one card, then you have 4 cards of a straight or a flush, or have 2 pairs. If you bet reasonably low in the first round of betting, then increase it slightly in the second until people start passing, then bump it up to max, then you should get the biggest rewards.
If you've been dealt three of a kind, then when you change 2 cards, people will assume you're either keeping a pair and a high card, or a three of a kind, or bluffing and hoping for a reward on the draw so there's not that much you can do.
It all depends on so many factors : how many people are playing, how good they are, what other people are drawing, etc, etc.
I'm not really a 5 card draw fan myself, I prefer 7 card stud or 7 card river, since there's a lot more skill in figuring out what people have and making people believe you have something that you do not.

Well, pk, it definitely is a very tough call. Just think of the underlying psychology. If you have a reputation for being very conservative, never bluffing, and then all of a sudden you start betting high, well, folks are apt to fold. Or if you don't take any cards on the draw, the other card players can only assume one of two things: you're bluffing the heck out of them or you've got a monster hand. They're gonna venture a guess based on your poker playing personality.
If you want to have fun, try it some time. It sounds to me like you don't bluff too often. Next game, try betting low-to-moderate, take no cards, and then bet higher. See how many people keep the nerve to stay in. It all comes down to how people analyze you.
But to directly address the OP, when I play and get dealt a decent hand, I start the betting relatively hard. Not hard enough so most will drop out, but hard enough that people may suspect I'm bluffing and will stay in just to call my bluff. Then again, when I play, I do occassionally throw a couple games early on with high initial bets, so people do stay in and realize that early high bets are not unusual for me even with a weak hand.

Day Two, Meeting with Thieves. It rained. We stood waiting in the drizzle in a park behind some kiddie carnival rides, pretty certain they wouldn’t show up. I mean, it’s crazy to think a pickpocket will keep an appointment anyway. Let alone in the rain.
We waited half an hour. But—we had arrived half an hour early.
Here’s where I shouldn’t say more. Just…stay tuned! The feature film will be out in about a year! [Actually, on December 2, 2011 on the National Geographic Channel, 8pm] But c’mon… you’ll have forgotten in a year, right? Or maybe you’ll see the film anyway, even if I kill the suspense. I can tell you…
Ed showed up first. Frank zipped up on his motorcycle moments later, and Marc came from somewhere. All prompt.
We needed the thieves to sign releases before our production company could film them. Ed had questions. We squabbled in the rain until until someone herded us under the trees where it was dryer. Our big cameras moved in and circled the group. A few men wandered in from the street, obvious friends and partners of the pickpockets. A full hour of heated philosophizing: Why do you want to see demonstrations? Why do you want to know these things? What you do on stage is totally different from what we do in the street. What we do is not something to be proud of.
Finally, an agreement is reached and releases are signed. They are “anonymous releases,” meaning that we’ll have to blur their faces. That’s such a shame. These are expressive men, with eyes you’d want to see.
The rain stops and the demonstrations begin. The men had brought their tools: floppy messenger bags, a shopping bag. jackets, caps, and sunglasses. We had brought a man in a suit as a volunteer victim.
Frank, Marc, and Ed position our victim next to a lamp post and tell him to pretend he’s on a bus. Then they take their places like dancers in a ballet, without words. Instantly and automatically, the three men position themselves around him. Their pal Clay appears and joins in. The victim is jostled a little, and we are allowed a glimpse of what the men would usually hide: Frank’s hand in the victim’s breast pocket. We see Frank’s hand drop and the wallet fall into a shopping bag that Clay holds low. None of the men look at what they’re doing. It’s all by rote and intuition.
The men split and disperse in four directions. Applause. All our film crew are beaming, thrilled on so many levels. They’ve never associated with pickpockets. They’ve never seen how a steal is done by professional criminals. They got the demo on camera. And they’re a little queasy to find that they’re amused by the technical skills of thieves.
It’s not just their technical skills, though. It’s their cooperation, their exuberance, their humanness. They’ve become the opposite of cold and faceless.
Is it okay to enjoy this? Everyone’s high-fiving and thumbs-upping. The pride of the men is rewarded with amazement and glee. The thieves are so darn likable. Can we let ourselves actually like them? Should we pretend to ourselves that we’re just pretending to like them?
The director wants another take and the team is happy to repeat the scene. They’re having fun and tickled by the director’s call: Aaaaaand… action!
Van Royko, our director of photography, shows the last take on a monitor. Pickpocket crew and film crew crowd in to watch.
There are more demonstrations: how to get money out of a wallet without removing the wallet from the pocket, how to get cash out of a pouch under trousers, how much harder it is to get a wallet out of the back pocket of jeans if the wallet is jammed in sideways.
For fun, Bob steals a belt. We see the lightbulb go on over Frank. Moneybelts! “Teach me that trick!” he says, “Please!” We didn’t mean to give him new ideas. Laughing, Bob and I imagine puzzled police officer, suddenly taking reports of stolen belts all across town.
We continue for hours. The conversation is animated. It’s like a party without the cocktails. Michele is translating, recording sound, and watching his monitor levels all at the same time, while smiling. We have two other translators, and everyone’s talking at once. Our poor director has to yell for silence more than action.
It’s past 7:00 by the time we all leave the park. I wonder what the pickpockets tell their wives when they return home without cash. We made a movie! We laughed and had fun with foreigners! Yeah, right.

The photo-essay documents the ongoing human impact of Chernobyl on those who survived, their children, and the extended communities around them.
This photo (link to full-size), taken by Knoth in Minsk, Belarus:
Twin brothers Michael and Vladimir Iariga, 16 years old. Michael, with hydrocephalus, is five minutes older than Vladimir, who is deaf.
(...) Some areas in the closed zones around Chernobyl are so contaminated that they will have to remain closed off for up to 900 years.
Reader comment: Mike says,
Thanks for letting people know that there are still repercussions from the Chernobyl disaster 20 years later. I've been fortunate to work with the Chernobyl Children's Project based in Boston as they help children in the region who suffer from radiation-related ailments. CCP provides medical care to those in need and, thanks to the generosity of volunteer host families, brings groups of children to the U.S. for month-long visits. A series of events to commemorate the anniversary of the disaster and to make sure these children aren't forgotten..

Ryan North's The best of Dinosaur Comics: 2003-2005 A.D. had me howling with laughter and passing the book around to whomever I could lay hands on to point out particularly good strips..
This is a wordy comic. The jokes are often erudite, sometimes just plain goofy. The creator, Ryan North, is mining this odd little visual vein and coming up with a seemingly bottomless well of extremely funny material. Some of it relies on the visuals, some would work nearly as well as text.
Every now and again, Satan appears and drones on about his favorite video games. Then the T-Rex will explore (in his charming, naive way), philosophy and religion. Then there's a strip about polyamory. Then several strips about etymology and word choices. Funny jokes about comic books. Then God appears and T-Rex is the only one who can hear him. Then cuttlefish move in next door and behave in a threatening manner. Fan-culture and the canon make an appearance. And so on.
This strip is so improbable, so unconventional -- and so wonderful. It's like a distillation of the funniest stuff on the web, improbably combined with clip art, unapologetically weird and interesting and fantastic.

Bake a Cake for Bone Cancer 2010
Thank You!
Celebrities and supporters alike donned their chefs whites and baked a cake for BCRT in 2010!
A huge thank you to all of our supporters who took part in Bake a Cake for Bone Cancer during Awareness Week 2010.
Over 40 Bake a Cake events were organised around the country, from a cake and book sale at an office to a cake bake at a Rugby League ground.
Cake competitions and sales were held in workplaces, schools and tea rooms across the Country. Whatever was organised, all who took part had a great time, and raised vital funds towards our work, and helped raise awareness of primary bone cancer during awareness week.
Inspired by James Corden's Victory Cake, you have been baking in your dozens to help us make our second Bake a Cake event a huge success! From the pictures we received, it seems some of you have hidden baking talents!
Still want to join in?
You can still organise a Bake a Cake for Bone Cancer Event! Email info@bcrt.org.uk or call 0113 2621852 for a bake a cake pack.

A Camping Spree with Mr Magee by Chris Van Dusen
A Camping Spree with Mr. Magee
by Chris Van Dusen
Ages: 4-8
Topics: Camping, wildlife, adventure
Cheerful Mr. Magee and his little dog Dee, pack up the camper and "hit the road" for a camping trip in the mountains. "There's nothing like camping," a jubilant Magee tells Dee:
The views are fantastic! There's hardly a sound.
Aside from the wildlife, there's no one around"
Their campsite certainly offers a spectacularly colorful sunset view, and the companions enjoy a happy evening cooking hotdogs and marshmallows over a campfire and enjoying the serene view of the surrounding mountains, brook, and waterfall.
It's soon time for bed and, while the duo snuggle down in carefree repose, they are visited by a large bear with poor eyesight, but a good nose for marshmallows. In his quest for sweets, the bear manages to unhitch the camper and send it rollin' down the mountain and straight into the brook,
Dee and Magee both started to quiver,
As faster and faster they headed downriver.
But just when they thought they'd fall over the edge...
Their camper got stuck on a rock at the ledge.
So there they were, stranded, Magee and his pup,
On the top of the waterfall, fifty feet up!
Luckily for the camping pals, the nearsighted bear comes to the rescue, mistaking the hitch for ...no, no...I'm not going to give away the creative resolution of this entertaining story!
This is one of those rare children's books that is as appealing to the adults reading aloud as it is for the excited children listening to the story. As you can tell from the quote above, this book has a wonderful read aloud pace, magically reminiscent of Clement Moore's The Night Before Christmas, yet decidedly modern and tongue-in-cheek, with a dash of superhero hyperbole. These elements also translate to Van Dusen's vivid gouache illustrations.
Magee's world, rendered in 50s retro style, has an ordered and idyllic brightness to it, from Magee's perfectly trimmed and mowed backyard and spotless camper to the symmetrically consistent fir trees of the wilderness. All the illustrations convey a buoyant optimism and symmetry, even in the most dire circumstances (as the duo float down the river and end up looking over the waterfall, their hair stands on end reflecting the shape of the fir trees around them). Magee's thick glasses, plaid shirt, and sneakers suggest a nerdy character, but when the situation knocks a golden hair or two out of place, the glasses seem Clark Kentish, a superficial geeky detail covering a noble interior. Dee is the perfect wordless companion. His long ears speak for him: they fly behind him with carefree aplomb as the couple drive out in the convertible, stand up on end in the more nail-biting moments, and gently hang by his side when all is serene.
The illustrations include wonderful details - a very-surprised raccoon watching the camper hit the water, the spilled salt and pepper and cheesy placemats in the rescued camper - and grandiose, brilliant landscapes that really draw the reader in with amazement.
This lively and funny story conveys a rare enthusiasm and will bring wide-eyed excitement and twinkling eyes to both girls and boys, before returning them to a perfectly ordered world. So if you're looking for that perfect gift, I suggest A Camping Spree with Mr Magee and Van Dusen's other wonderful books.
Chris Van Dusen also wrote and illustrated two other wonderful books, Down to the Sea with Mr Magee

- Jim at the Travis McGee Reader attended the Iowa Straw poll and has a series of posts on the topic written in his inimitable style. I was somewhat disappointed to see no photographs of actual straws.
- Santa Rosa, CA PD SWAT sets up a little display for the kiddies at a neighborhood festival, including a couple of firearms on the junk-on-the-bunk table. Said kiddies are allowed (under supervision) to touch. The Eloi at the local newspaper issue a Code Brown PSH Alert. Good thing the Army recruiters didn't set up a booth; those guys bring 240 Bravos and grenade launchers.

Tab Clearing...
17 comments:
You simply couldn't pay me enough to live in CA.
TJ: Ditto. I escaped way back in '78, never been back, never will.
cap'n chumbucket
That big earthquake can't happen soon enough in CA. Sorry for all who live there and/or love the place, but it's past time for the failed state to sink.
Family day in my National Guard armored unit had kids crawling through M1's, riding M113's through the woods, handling 120mm mortars, and Mk19's. Obviously ammo never left the arms lockers.
When I was in JROTC in high school, some soldiers brought two humvees for us to check out. One had a TOW mounted and the other a M-60. If the SWAT display gave them a Code Brown, I can only imagine what that would have done.
"But police and event organizers defended the display as a successful community outreach effort that is in line with the department's efforts to demystify law enforcement generally and its SWAT team in particular.“ Demystify, yes. Acculturate, yes. Guns are cool, but it used to be that the primary tool of the policeman was a set of handcuffs. There are still officers who somehow used to get the job done with a revolver. When they arm them, clothe them, and equip them like the army, people think of them like an occupying army. I would think that Officer Friendly would serve the purpose of community outreach far better. Remember, we want these kids to be willing to help or at least be willing to talk to the police one day should the need arise. SWAT does not equal Jedi. "The police is the public and the public is the police." Besides I bet that sniper scope is hard to use while laying down automatic fire. If only it had one of those shoulder things that goes up... -8notch
8notch,
""The police is the public and the public is the police.""
Damn right. I have a dot-sighted carbine to defend myself, why can't Officer Friendly? That works both ways, you know.
No particular order:
Jim at TMcGR gets it! Yay Ron Paul!
I think the police should be issued nerf bats and whistles, and otherwise be allowed to arm themselves just like regular civilians---to include suppressed SBRs with happy switches! And dot sights!
I like that the Eloi who freaked out is named Attila Nagy. I really like that.
That article has nearly every square for my "Reporter writing about guns" bingo card. Holy crap.
City councilwoman was "devastated" to see a (little brown) child touch a gun.
However, she seems undevastated by the fact that
"The police presence was welcomed by residents, some of whom were concerned about attending an evening event in their park, said Oscar Chavez, executive director of Community Action Partnership".
I thought it was interesting that the reporter called it a "fully-automatic assault rifle but couldn't resist labeling the optic a "sniper scope". If your only tool is hyperbole I guess all articles look like a good place to write it..
If SOMEBODY would give the writers and others like him a REAL JOB, perhaps there would be no need for a "code Brown" at this event. Sigh.
Ulises from CA
Thanks for the lnk, Tam, and as to:
>>>I was somewhat disappointed to see no photographs of actual straws.<<<
There were no actual straws present, but hayseed was plentiful. :)
OMG, it's a FULLY AUTOMATIC ASSAULT RIFLE with a SNIPER SCOPE being handled by (gasp) a child! Gosh it's good to be so ignorant of the things you fear the most.
Gee, I guess no one gave any thought to the fact that handling all that cool cop gear might just persuade some of those kids to go down a different path, like maybe aspiring to be a police officer instead of a gang-banger...just sayin'.
Thank God when we do these sort of events in Oklahoma no one cares or pays much attention to us letting the kiddies handle the gear, since it's pretty much just like the rifle they have at home ;)
I distinctly recall the Army visit to my small southern university in 1977. They brought an Apache attack helicopter, and let us students climb in and handle the knobs.
The young officer showing it off said to me as I climbed in, "If you get it started you can fly it." Frustratingly complex was the instrument panel, and I suspect he had pulled a fuse or two just to be safe.
I remembered that officer very clearly some years later, the first time I played with a flight simulator in an Apple-based Indiana Jones game. I bet they don't say things like that too often now.
Sort of on-topic: what's the breakdown of the team you use to clear a tab, and do you toss flash-bang or a propane tank wrapped in detcord into the tab before you go in?

I have a hard time remembering what happened if I don’t write it down like……..see? That was too long.
Immediately.
I must write it down. Immediately.
Let me try to recreate our weekend from the little memory I still possess……
Tim and I had a jam packed few days, complete with lots of snow (somewhere around eight inches in total when everything was all said and done) and a dual-driveway-shoveling effort at 5:30 am on Saturday.
Why so early?
Tim had a haircut scheduled in the morning and we had to get the fresh powder off of the driveway before we left. It makes shoveling somucheasier when you don’t have to deal with tire tracks.
Just FYI.
Anyhow, as soon as we got home, we hopped on Skype (OMG. WHY HAVE WE NEVER USED THIS?!) for the “virtual” baby shower. It was super fun and kind of like watching a sitcom at times, since it was just the two of us watching a whole bunch of people do all kinds of things at my mom’s house – some of the commotion directed at us, some not.
Also? Lots of movement and talking = choppy connection and trying to understand what someone said sometimes was…..challenging – to say the least.
I definitely, however, didn’t miss anyone – everyone – asking about the name for the sprout.
No one really knew how the whole gift giving thing was supposed to work, so some people had shipped us gifts (that have not come, yet) and some people brought gifts to my mom’s…..that they then had to open for us so we could see what it was.
I’m positive no one went into that shower thinking they’d have to open their own gift.
Pair that with never-ending mimosas (for them…not me) and you get lots of women dancing in front of the camera all, “I woooonnnndeeeeeer what this isssss?……” as they ripped open their own wrapping.
The whole thing was so comical, I don’t even remember anything we got other than a swaddle thing and a monkey with a tail you pull to play lullabies…good thing my mom took pictures and is making a list because I’d be up a creek without a rattle (ha…) without that.
Yesterday?
Yesterday was Sunday!
Also known as baby sprout’s nursery furniture pick up day!
One of Tim’s work peeps offered to help us – and bring their truck – to get the boxes home and upstairs. Good thing, too, because there was no way Tim and I would have been able to fit the boxes in our car and there was absolutely zero possibility for Tim to haul either box upstairs by himself. I mean, I’m not supposed to lift anything over 25 pounds…or is it 20 pounds?….and each box weighed over 100.
Even if I only did 50% of the work – and I’m not great at math but I’m pretty sure that’d still be too, um, heavy.
On Saturday night, I made him (the worker peep) chocolate chip cookies, all wrapped up with a pretty bow (for serious), as a thank you.
After Tim’s worker peep left the house, crib and dresser upstairs safe and sound, Tim got a text on his work phone from his son all, “Tim…this is worker peeps son. My dad is driving and we just wanted to tell you that the cookies are delicious!“
Happy dance!
Then?
Tim couldn’t wait to rip open the boxes and get to work.
I know I’ve said this before but if there is any kind of project to be done, it doesn’t sit around in this house.
Noooooooooo.
Tim has this wiring in his brain that says DO IT NOW.
(I totally shouldn’t complain…it’s usually the opposite, right?)
So, by the end of last night, Maddie and Lexi had checked out the boxes for any kind of suspicious material (they didn’t find any)
And we had a mostly complete – minus decorations and a mattress…and crib sheets…and a glider-rocker… – nursery!
I know it looks black but it’s really espresso.
Just thought you should know.
Loooove the new baby furniture!! I still contend – you need to come decorate my house, baby room or no baby room. Deal?? Can we make a barter arrangement? You can totally be our fourth – long-lost – sister??
Oh freak I love it!!! I love the virtual baby shower thing too. How fun! Also, I would haev leant you my truck and my fiance..duh….
Co-worker peep……I think my cat is even preturbed by that.
Looking good, my friend. And I concur, decorate my house too!
Yay! So cute! And how fun that you got a virtual shower (including the tipsy ladies). That’s hilarious!!
you totally forgot the cousin and aunt who came to you from Florida via brother Jeff’s facetime…via skype
1. Furniture = awesome.
2. It looks cold outside.

The Boston Red Sox acquired 26-year olds Mike Carp from the Seattle Mariners for cash and a player to be named later. Carp, a 6′ 2″, 210 pound first baseman/left fielder who has has been with the Mariners since 2009, was optioned earlier this month by Seattle.

Carp provides insurance for two of Boston’s thinnest defensive spots. Carp can back up Mike Napoli at first base if necessary and could platoon with Jonny Gomes and Daniel Nava in left field, especially if Ryan Kalish – recently placed in Boston’s 60 day DL – doesn’t bounce back from his shoulder surgery.
“It’s definitely a better opportunity for me than staying in Seattle as far as their needs go and my chance to get as many at-bats as possible,” Carp told The Seattle Times’ Geoff Baker.
“It’s really exciting,” Carp said. “I have a chance to go to a great organization and should really get a chance to play. I’m looking forward to showing them what I can do.”
In 2011, Carp hit a promising .276 with 12 homers in a career-high 79 games but dipped to .213 in 59 games in 2012. Carp has a career slash line of .255/.327/.413/.740.

Erstad signs one-year deal with Astros
Veteran to serve as lefty bat and backup outfielder off bench
HOUSTON -- Outfielder Darin Erstad has reached an agreement with the Astros on a one-year contract worth $1 million plus incentives, general manager Ed Wade confirmed on Thursday.
Erstad, a veteran of 12 big league seasons, will provide a left-handed bat off the bench, as well as serve as a backup outfielder. The 33-year-old has experience at all three outfield positions and first base. In his career, Erstad has played 499 games in center, 272 in left, 10 in right and 601 games at first base.
"He'll be a left-handed bat off the bench," Wade said. "He has a lot of versatility. He's a great makeup guy. He's the prototypical professional player -- he brings a lot to the table and we're glad to have him."
Erstad played 11 years with the Angels before signing with the White Sox prior to the 2007 season. He has a career batting average of .284 with 118 home runs and 657 RBIs.
In 2007 with Chicago, Erstad hit .248 with four homers and 32 RBIs over 87 games. He missed nearly half the season with a sprained left ankle.
The top overall pick in the June 1995 First-Year Player Draft by the Angels, Erstad is a two-time All-Star (1998, 2000) who is also the only player in Major League history to win a Rawlings Gold Glove Award as an infielder (first base, 2004) and an outfielder (2000, '02).
Erstad holds the American League record for consecutive errorless fielding chances by an outfielder with 723 from June 30, 2001-Sept. 22, 2002, breaking the previous mark held by Ken Griffey Jr. (573, 1992-93).

SEATTLE -- The Mariners continued to shore up their pitching staff Saturday, signing left-handed reliever Oliver Perez to a one-year deal shortly after he'd hit free agency.
Jon Heyman of CBSSports.com reported the deal is for $1.5 million, with another potential $600,000 in performance bonuses.
Perez is the second pitcher re-signed by the club, after starter Hisashi Iwakuma received a two-year.
Perez, 31, was one of the better comeback stories in baseball last year, resurrecting his Major League career as a reliever two years after being released by the Mets with $12 million still on his contract. He posted a 2.12 ERA in 33 appearances with the Mariners after being called up in midseason from Triple-A Tacoma.
Perez posted the ninth-lowest ERA by an American League reliever with a minimum of 30 appearances after joining the team on June 16. He had a stretch of 20 consecutive appearances from July 13 to Sept. 14 without allowing a run, tied for the fourth-longest streak in club history.
 pitched in the Nationals' Minor League system in 2011 and then found new life as a reliever in the Mexican Winter Leagues, where the Mariners saw his renewed fastball and gave him a shot on a Minor League deal that paid $750,000.
He wound up establishing himself as a solid member of Seattle's bullpen in the second half, allowing just seven runs and 27 hits in 29 2/3 innings with 10 walks and 24 strikeouts.
Perez combined with Rule 5 reliever Lucas Luetge and converted starter Charlie Furbush to give manager Eric Wedge three solid left-handers out of his bullpen even after Sherrill was lost for the season after pitching just two games.
The 10-year Major League veteran previously pitched as a starter with the Padres, Pirates and Mets. He has a career record of 59-72 with a 4.57 ERA and was a 15-game winner for the Mets in 2007, but struggled badly after signing a three-year, $36 million deal with the Mets in 2009.
He seems to have found a new niche now in relief.
"I felt pretty good this year," Perez told MLB.com at the season's conclusion. "This was kind of a new role for me, but I would like to be a reliever again because normally you get the chance to pitch every day. I can be a starter again, but right now I feel good in the bullpen."
With Perez's signing, the Mariners' 40-man roster now stands at 36.

Pollock not intimidated by outfield depth
Prospect likely to begin season at Reno, just a phone call away from big leagues
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- When thinking of the crowded D-backs outfield and which player in the organization suffers the most from it, Gerardo Parra is typically the first guy to come to mind.
But for Parra, being the fourth outfielder still means receiving consistent playing time in the big leagues. Being slotted as the fifth or sixth outfielder, however, is another story.
That's A.J. Pollock's role coming into camp, despite being ranked as the club's No. 8 prospect by MLB.com. With Parra backing up Jason Kubel, Adam Eaton and Cody Ross, and with Eric Hinske available as an emergency outfielder, Pollock's chances of making the 25-man Opening Day roster are pretty slim, barring injury.
So does the 25-year-old get frustrated with the lack of opportunity, even though he's a well thought of prospect? Not really. He embraces the competition.
"You never want anything handed to you, so it's a good thing we have so many quality players," he said. "It's always good to have depth and you never know when it'll be your turn. We all work great together and we're all competing. I like it."
Last season, Pollock got his beak wet in the Majors, as the D-backs called him up to the big leagues five separate times throughout the year, twice for just a single day. He made his debut on April 18 and finished the season batting .247 with eight runs and eight RBIs in 81 at-bats. The short stints with Arizona gave Pollock a good sense of the atmosphere and competition level, but not being able to stick around for any lengthy period of time didn't let him fully adjust.
At Triple-A Reno, he played every day, but during his time with the D-backs, he found himself in the unfamiliar situation of only being used sparingly.
"It's part of the game. I knew if I got up, that was my role," Pollock said. "You just have to make it work. You can either say it's real hard or you can try to work with it and compete every day. For me, though, meeting the guys and just getting comfortable up there was the biggest thing."
Drafted in the first round out of Notre Dame in 2009, Pollock made a quick ascension through the D-backs' farm system. In each of his last two Minor League campaigns, he has hit above .300 with his most productive year coming last season when he posted a .369 on-base percentage at Reno, which won a league championship.
"It was fun. I had a great time with those guys," he said. "Things worked out down there and to finish what we started, it was great. Everyone was on the same page, everyone was working toward the same thing, which was making the players better and winning games."
Manager Kirk Gibson has liked Pollock since the first time he saw him. So much so that he has even reached out to one of his old college coaches at Notre Dame, Graham Sikes, who now coaches Gibson's son at Michigan State.
"I've talked with him a lot about A.J.," Gibson said. "A.J. is a guy whose thought process is similar to Goldy [Paul Goldschmidt]. He's curious about a lot of different things, he wants you to point out something when you see it. Some guys, you have to develop a relationship with before they take it the right way, but A.J. is certainly a guy who will listen."
So far this spring, Pollock has a .278 on-base percentage in 16 at-bats, but he isn't concerned with his production just yet. He's more worried about getting back into a rhythm at the plate.
"I'm getting everything in order right now. You kind of have a check list you go through," he said. "As a hitter, it's hard to fully focus on results from the start. You just want to make sure you're seeing pitches well, your timing is good and everything feels right up there. Hopefully, I'll be peaking toward the end of spring so I can flow right into the season."
Whether that means beginning 2013 in Reno again, Pollock isn't sure, but according to his manager, the outfielder won't be far off the club's radar regardless of where he is.
"He's right there, so if nobody gets hurt and somebody goes to the Minor Leagues, they are right there," Gibson said. "He's just a solid ballplayer, what doesn't he do well?"

For a meaningless, regular season finale, Wednesday night's matchup between the Celtics and Knicks sure was entertaining.
With seven members of their regular rotation sidelined, the C's still had enough to beat their soon-to-be playoff opponents, using career nights from Avery Bradley and Sasha Pavlovic to beat New York, 112-102. Pavlovic scored 19 points and hit 4-of-5 from long distance in 35 minutes off the bench while Bradley, seeing extensive time at the point due to the absence of both Rajon Rondo and Delonte West, put in 20 points on 10-of-16 shooting, along with three rebounds, two assists and two steals in 27 minutes. The C's led by just two after three quarters but ran away in the fourth, leading by as many as 16 before cruising to victory and finishing up at 56-26.
Glen Davis led Wednesday's starters with 17 points and eight rebounds while Jeff Green had his second straight solid game, finishing with 14 points, eight boards and three assists.
The Knicks, who will return to TD Garden for Game 1 of their first round playoff series with the Celts on Sunday, rested Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups, but gave their other star, Amare Stoudemire, some run after the big man had missed their last three games with an ankle sprain. Stoudemire hoisted 15 shots in just 20 minutes, making six of them and ending up with 14 points and four rebounds. Rookie guard Landry Fields led the Knicks with 18 points and seven boards, while former Celtic Bill Walker started and chipped in 12 points in 24 minutes.
Nenad Krstic, who will likely be coming off the bench once the games matter again, started on Wednesday and 13 points to go with six rebounds. It's expected that Shaquille O'Neal will be available for Game 1 on Sunday, as will Jermaine O'Neal, who was one of the spectators on Wednesday. Game 1 will be played at 7 p.m. EDT, on Sunday and can be seen on TNT.

Patriots have walk-through, but center Dan Koppen gets day off
The Patriots went through a walk-through in the bubble, rather than practicing in the cold and brutal wind. With the late Monday night game, figure their bodies need some rest.
QB Tom Brady participated for the first time in the midweek in a month, but it didn't look like he was throwing. More than likely, Brady is doing some arm maintenance, as now is the time his arm is probably feeling a little sore.
The team also did not have center Dan Koppen, who I'm told is taking a veteran day off. He talked after the game, and did not appear injured. Just a little sore.
Meanwhile, CB Jonathan Wilhite (hip) and DL Mike Wright (head) were also not present. But DL Myron Pryor returned, which is a good sign.

Man's Leg Broken During Attempted Robbery
The 69-year-old was riding his bike home when a man knocked him down and tried to rob him
A 69-year-old man suffered a broken leg this morning after a man tried to rob him and then threw him and his bike to the ground when he didn't get any money, according to a Manatee County Sheriff's report.
Harry Hayward, who lives in the Palma Sola Harbour condos, was taken by Emergency Medical Services to Blake Hopsital where he is being treated for a broken leg.
According to the sheriff's report:
Hayward was riding his bike west bound on Cortez Road around 10 a.m. today when he was approached by a man who asked him for money. Hayward did not give the suspect any money and rode his bike home.
The suspect followed Hayward as he rode home to the Palma Sola Harbour condos where he lived. The suspect was riding in an older white Dodge 4-door car with oxidized paint and missing hub caps.
Once they got to the condominium project, the suspect got out of the car and went up to Hayward and again asked him for money. When Hayward told the suspect he didn't have any money, the suspect shoved Harry off the bike and on to the ground.
Hayward yelled for help as the suspect jumped back into the car being driven by a woman. The pair quickly drove off headed toward Cortez Road.
Anyone with information about the assault may contact the Manatee County Sheriff's Office.

Who knew that Italian ciao was a variation of schiavo "(I am your) servant" from medieval Latin sclavus "slave".
slave was borrowed from Old French esclave, which is related to the Latin sclavus. The Latin word was borrowed into English as Slav.
Further etymology of sclavus is uncertain. In my previous post I write that Slav and slave seem to be derived from Proto-Slavic *slovo "word" or *slava "fame, glory" but I think I was wrong. The OED says Old Slavic Slovēne is supposed to be derived from slovo, but is it really? The whole thing is a bit of a muddle.
10 comments:
I'd love to know the etymology of "slave" as well but it looks like time has erased many leads. It really is an interesting muddle.
Similar story in Swedish. The greetings `tja' or `tjena' is an abbreviation of `tjenare' which is a variant of `tjänare’in the phrase ‘Jag förbliver Eder ödmjukaste tjänare’ (I remain your most humble servant).
What makes you doubt the origin from *slovo "word" or *slava "fame, glory" ?
be_slayed: just because I haven't seen any clear statement to this effect. All the OED says is that Slovēne "is supposed to be derived from the stem of slovo word, sloviti to speak."
I think you guys are on the right track. I never understood why the derivation of Common Slavic (CS) Slovēne from *k'lew- 'hear' was considered controversial. It seems the IE verb *klew- (attested in CS sly- > Proto-CS *ślū) is the origin of all the words in question:
CS *slovo 'word' > Proto-CS *ślavam
CS *slava 'fame' > Proto-CS *ślāvā cf. Indic śravas Greek klewos
CS *slověne 'Slavs (pl)' > Proto-CS *ślavēnai (?)
CS *slavitь 'glorifies' > Proto-CS *ślāviti =(?) Indic śrāvayati
It seems IE *e, inasmuch as it ever existed, must've merged with Proto-CS *a before labials sometime long ago.
Is it a question of which word exactly *slověne is derived from? Would that have archeaological implications? I'm wondering if the vowel lengths point to the answer. Input welcome. Ciao!
Hermeneuo: "It seems IE *e, inasmuch as it ever existed, [...]"
??
Oh, I had assumed that to have phonemic status a sound had to appear in minimal pairs (e.g. bat : bet).
I haven't seen any examples of PIE *o and *e being in phonemic opposition. I'd appreciate any thoughts on whether they are distinct phonemes.
According to Fortson in Indo-European Language and Culture, *e and *o are distinct phonemes. I think I found a minimal pair in *krét-u-s "insight, intelligence", and the genitive form *krót-u-s.
Great find. I think it's an example of IE apophony (cf Fortson 4.12; 4.16). The classic 'proof' of *e≠*o also involves apophony: Indic cakram=*kʷekʷlos=Greek kyklos, yet I fail to see what this actually proves beyond च≠क. As with the etymology of *slovene, on the surface *e:*o is an inconsequential chicken-and-egg trifle, yet entire 'historical narratives' might indeed hinge upon it. Interesting stuff, thanks for bringing it up.
Yes *krét-u-s / *krót-u-s is apophony, but it's still a minimal pair, isn't it?

Ty Stone album release and a pleasant surprise…
Let me start by saying I am NOT a concert photographer nor a music critic in any way but I did shoot a concert recently. I’m not going to spend alot of time on Ty Stone - what could I possibly say? The guy is a solid musician, he’s backed by Kid Rock, his career is set. I was invited by a member of his management after I requested a portrait session so I went to the show to snag a few shots and possibly meet Ty in person; I quickly realized that after a slew of press events and commercial shoots down in Nashville that I would probably not be the first thing on his radar. I was, however, pleasantly surprised before Ty took the stage. Paulina Jayne, Brandon Calhoon, and Doop and the Inside Outlaws opened the evening. I still can’t get over the fact that Paulina is only 16! She played a heartfelt, boot stomping set with a great band and sang her heart out. Brandon Calhoon belted out some sweet southern rock that I haven’t heard live in long time; his wailing guitar and resonating vocals made my camera shake. Empassioned would be an understatement. Doop and the Inside Outlaws wowed the crowd as usual with some bluesy, country rock that was exceptional. Clever lyrics and outstanding work by the band as a single unit kept me at the stage edge longer than I expected. These three bands are trying to carve a line for themselves and reach the limelight, and they still have a lot to say and a lot of fight in them. It was really great to see a group of gifted musicians play like crazy and put on fantastic shows. I find Detroit endlessly fascinating when it comes to music. The city where Motown was born is also home to spectacular Rock legends and pinnacles of Rap and Country - it’s a music melting pot, and it offers endless opportunities that were not afforded to me in other cities that I’ve lived and worked in. Check out the collection of shots I took. I think you’ll feel like you are right there with me, seeing some excellent musicians play their hearts out. You may want to update your playlist with their music too.

Hi Everyone,
Welcome to another work week. Sorry to remind you. But today, we do have a new review. This one is about Rockstar Rehab. Just like XDurance, I was absolutely intrigued to try this one. The main reason: Rockstar Rehab contains coconut water, but with 160 mg of caffeine. Basically, this is just another flavor to the Recovery line-up, at least in a way. I didn’t mind the flavor to this one. Coconut is very good for you to begin with, but I know coconut water is not for everyone. And after the week I had (Not that my week was bad, but it was busy), I needed a drink like Rockstar Rehab. I’m not saying I will drink this one religiously when it comes to the Rockstar line-up. But I would certainly buy it again. Wednesday’s review: Rockstar Iced. ng, potassium (monopotassium phosphate) 2 mg, vitamin B12 30 mcg.
Non-Medicinal Ingredients (Per 473 mL): Water, sugar, coconut water concentrate, phosphoric acid, pectin, potassium sorbate, calcium lactate pentahydrate, coconut flavor, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, caramel color.

From the Journals of Jean Seberg
Literally burned by Preminger, driven crazy by an army of husbands, hangers-on, and J. Edgar Hoover, Jean Seberg lives on in a new documentary.
Writer-director Mark Rappaport, familiar from 1992's Rock Hudson's Home Movies, has devised an ingenious strategy for dealing with this complex character in From the Journals of Jean Seberg. He hired Mary Beth Hurt (born 10 years later in the same Iowa town as Seberg) to play the actress as if she didn't commit suicide in 1979 but lives on — like all actors — through the magic of film, reincarnated as a sort of performance artist, film historian, and cultural commentator. The illusion is remarkably successful from Hurt's first appearance — she has the look of an aging gamin, disillusioned but still vibrant and droll. The title of the film is typical of Rappaport's devious approach — the "diaries" don't exist, they're simply Rappaport's clever conceit to explore issues of voyeurism, stardom, and exploitation.
The format of the film is loosely chronological, starting with Seberg's appearance in Saint Joan after being chosen from 3000 contenders. We learn that director Preminger's legendary cruelty extended far beyond the usual director-actor trials: on the day that a Life magazine photographer was invited to cover Joan being burned at the stake, Preminger allowed Seberg to actually be burned. This event is rendered in a dazzling collage style typical of the film, including shots from the production, images from the Life magazine story, and Hurt talking about the event directly to the camera.
Rappaport puts Seberg in context as one of an army of cinematic Joans — Ingrid Bergman, Falconetti, Alida Valli — through clips that show both Seberg's freshness and youth and the beginnings of the exploitation of her image and her entrapment by it. Hurt talks in mock-horrific tones about the "curse of Joan," how the role had all kinds of tragic repercussions in the lives of the actresses who played her. Rappaport's leisurely digressions begin here — with Hurt describing things as seemingly tangential but fascinating as the fact that Falconetti's grandson was the first person in France to die of AIDS in 1984.
Seberg's next film was also for Preminger — Bonjour Tristesse. This time Rappaport gives her a kind of posthumous revenge against the dictatorial director. During filming, Preminger tormented her by threatening to replace her with Audrey Hepburn. In a startlingly clever scene, Rappaport shows an exchange between Seberg and David Niven, then reprises it by superimposing Hepburn's head over Seberg's. Hurt says she was secure that no 29-year-old (Hepburn) could play a 17-year-old. This is one of several comic superimpositions in the film, the funniest perhaps being when Hurt speculates that Barbra Streisand must have been one of the 3000 women who tried out for Saint Joan. In the scene of Joan burning at the stake, Rappaport replaces Seberg's head with that of poor wailing Babs.
Seberg's career was filled with disappointments — good roles that flopped at the box office (Lill.
Of course, Fonda, Redgrave, and Seberg had another crucial similarity — activist politics. And all suffered for it, says Seberg, though Fonda "was protected by her star image." Redgrave's work with the PLO decimated her roles, and she eventually passed into character parts. And Seberg? She was framed by the FBI, Hoover in particular, who leaked stories that she was pregnant by one of the Black Panthers, whose cause she fought for. When her child (the father was Romain Gary) died at birth, she insisted on a glass coffin, to show the world they had been duped. A series of nervous breakdowns followed that eventually killed Seberg in 1979 at the age of 40.
While the essentials of Seberg's life are here for star-gazers, Rappaport uses her as a springboard for a discussion of larger issues. His combination of patchwork-quilt visuals, comic superimpositions, witty speculations on showbiz ("It's called show business, not show art," Seberg reminds us), and intriguing analysis of America's fixation with the female face and body, makes for both imaginative biography and art.

I have been writing about vote fraud since 1993. Few Americans became interested in the cold reality that since the mid-1960s our elections have been rigged until the 2000 presidential election and the farce known as ‘hanging chads’. As regular readers of my columns know I belong to no party; I left the Republican Party in 1996 over vote fraud and the putrid world of dirty politics where the truth didn’t matter. It still doesn’t to party hacks whose only goal is to climb the political ladder of power.
The Florida, examined 126,00 ballots, 127 poll books and 141 voter signature books from 18 counties: “Thousands of ballots in heavily Democratic precincts were pre-punched for third-party candidates. Voting machines were rigged, tabulators were rigged, ballot boxes were stuffed, ballots were altered, ballots were sorted according to candidate, and ballots were destroyed.”?

Riseberge (xi cent.); Magna Risberge (xiii cent.);
Earls Rysebergh (xiv cent.); Princes Risburgh (xv
cent.).
The parish of Princes Risborough lies on the
western side of the county of Buckingham. It
contains 3,936¼ acres, the greater part, viz. 2,620
acres, being arable land. (fn. 1) There are 1,276¼ acres
laid down in permanent grass, and 40 acres of wood.
The subsoil is chalk, (fn. 2) but the surface soil is variable;
on the hills it is generally light and chalky, and
in the lowlands either loam or strong clay. The
parish lies on the north-western slope of the Chiltern
Hills, rising to over 770 ft. above the Ordnance
datum.
The occupation of the people is almost entirely
agricultural. There is an iron-foundry at the hamlet
of Looseley Row, and sequin and bead-work is done
by women at Lacey Green. Water-cress beds exist
near the town of Princes Risborough, where there are
several springs. Princes Risborough is a small market
town, lying 8¾ miles south of Aylesbury on the high
road from Aylesbury to Wycombe. The road from
Wycombe to Thame branches off to the north-west
at the northern end of the town, and the Upper
Icknield Way also crosses the parish. The Wycombe
branch of the Great Western Railway runs to the west of
the town, the station being about three-quarters of a
mile away. In 1906 the Great Central Railway
opened a branch line to Aylesbury in conjunction
with the Great Western Railway, and this line passes
through Princes Risborough Station. The centre of the
town is at the junction of the three main streets,
where the square, red-brick market-house stands, with
open arcades and a covered walk on its lower story,
and a wooden cupola containing a bell rising from its
low slate roof. There are a good many 18th-century
red-brick fronts, and near the market-house a gabled
half-timber house with herringbone brick filling and
a fine central chimney stack. The church is at the
north-west corner of the town, standing in a large
churchyard, and to the east of it is the manor-house,
with remains of two sides of a deep moat in its grounds.
The manor-house is a handsome red-brick building with pilasters and mouldings in cut and
rubbed brick. It appears to date from the beginning
of the 18th century, but its staircase and the panelling of the drawing-room are some fifty years
earlier, and may have been removed from an older
building on the same site. They fit so well into
their present position that it seems as if the house
must have been built with a view to receiving
them. The staircase is of oak with a heavy moulded
hand-rail and a balustrade of scrollwork, and large
square newels with ball finials and moulded pendants.
The drawing-room panelling is in two ranges with
tall arched upper panels, with small moulded key
blocks. Above is a frieze and an elaborate cornice of
many moulded members. The mantel is part of the
general design, and is enriched with a small Tuscan
order, a central oval panel, and flat baluster pilasters
below the mantel-shelf. At the window recesses are
pilasters reaching from floor to ceiling, the proportions, workmanship, and design being extremely good,
and though comparatively plain, the room is a charming example of its date. The entrance hall is also
panelled, but not so elaborately, and is probably of
the same date as the house. The windows throughout are sashed, and have heavy glazing bars.
Henry VIII made a grant to the inhabitants of
Princes Risborough in 1523 of a weekly market and
two yearly fairs. (fn. 3) The market was held on Wednesdays, and the fairs for three days at the Feast of the
Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, and on St. George's
Day. The market day in 1792 had been changed
to Saturday, and again in 1888 to Thursday. In
1792 there was only one fair held, on 6 May. (fn. 4) A
second fair has since been revived and is now held on
21 October.
The town obtained a charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1598, granting to the inhabitants immunity
from serving on juries and paying tolls. (fn. 5) The ancient
earthwork called Grim's Dyke enters the parish on
the north-eastern border by Lilly-bottom Farm, and
reaches to Lacey Green. To the west of the churchyard of Princes Risborough there is a site of about an
acre surrounded by a moat that popular tradition
asserts to be the site of the Black Prince's palace.
The civil parish of Princes Risborough contains the
hamlets of Longwick, Lacey Green, Looseley Row,
and Speen.
Before the Norman Conquest
PRINCES RISBOROUGH belonged to
King Harold. (fn. 6) There was attached to
the manor in his time a burgess of Oxford, who
remained there after the Norman Conquest, and a
salt-worker of Droitwich paid an unspecified number
of loads of salt to the lord of the manor in 1086. (fn. 7)
William the Conqueror kept the greater part of
Harold's lands, and so Princes Risborough became
part of the ancient demesne of the Crown. Half of
this part of Risborough seems, however, to have been
granted to Ansculf de Pinchengi very shortly after the
settlement of the Normans, (fn. 8) but was exchanged for part
of Ellesborough with Ralph Talgebosch or Taillebois,
by the king's command. Soon afterwards Risborough
again changed hands, and was held by the second Earl
Walter Giffard, who made various grants from these
lands to the abbey of Notley. (fn. 9) From 1162 to 1180
Princes Risborough is said to belong to the honour of
Giffard, (fn. 10) but on the death of the earl in 1164 it
reverted to the Crown, (fn. 11) and does not appear to have
been included in the grant of his honour made by
Richard I to William Marshal and Gilbert de Clare,
the heirs of the Giffards. Before 1165 the manor
was granted to Richard die Humeto, (fn. 12) the Constable
of Normandy, and from this time was reckoned among
the 'lands of the Normans.' The original grant was
probably made by Walter Giffard, but in 1173–4, after
his death, Henry II gave a new charter (fn. 13) to the constable. This grant was renewed on Richard's death
to his son and successor, William de Humeto. (fn. 14) The
latter does not appear, however, to have held the
manor, which went to his younger brother Engelard, (fn. 15)
but by what charter or right he held it is doubtful.
Engelard's son, named William de Similly, (fn. 16) succeeded
him, and held the manor till his death, circa 1205,
when it escheated to the king. (fn. 17) While in the royal
hands, various grants of land (fn. 18) in Risborough were
made, but only of a temporary nature, and by 1224 (fn. 19)
William de Similly's son, another William, was in
seisin of the manor. The heirs of Earl Giffard (fn. 20) now
made a determined attempt to recover Princes Risborough, claiming that it was part of the honour to
which they had succeeded. Moreover, they denied
that William de Similly could claim from the grant
to the Constable of Normandy, as that grant had been
made to Richard de Humeto and his heirs, and William was not his heir. No result came of their suit,
since it was decided that the question must stand over
till the king was of age. A second suit (fn. 21) was subsequently brought by Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, against
William de Similly, but the result is not recorded.
The latter, (fn. 22) however, remained in peaceful seisin of
the manor (fn. 23) till his death before 1242. (fn. 24) The land
then escheated to the king, the heir being a minor,
and the rights of wardship were granted to Drogo de
Trubleville. (fn. 25) The heir of William de Similly is
never mentioned again, and presumably died before
coming of age, for in 1243
Henry III granted the manor
of Princes Risborough to
Richard, Earl of Cornwall and
King of the Romans. (fn. 26) Richard
was succeeded by his son Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, (fn. 27) who
held the manor till his death
in 1300, (fn. 28) when it again came
into the king's hands, Edward I being the next heir.
The king held it in demesne
in 1302–3, (fn. 29) but immediately
afterwards he granted it to
Queen Margaret for life, in exchange for certain castles
and lands with which he had dowered her. (fn. 30) Margaret,
the Countess of Cornwall, however, held a third as part
of her widow's dower during her life. (fn. 31) The reversion was granted in 1309 to Piers Gaveston and his
wife Margaret, (fn. 32) one of the heiresses of the Clares,
and also one of the descendants of the Giffards, but
this grant was surrendered in the same year. (fn. 33) Queen
Margaret lived till 1316, (fn. 34) and from the time of her
death till 1327 the manor of Princes Risborough was
held by the king. (fn. 35) At the latter date Edward III
granted it to Queen Isabella in reward for her services with regard to the treaty with France and the
suppression of the Despensers' Rebellion. (fn. 36) In 1330
John de Eltham, Earl of Cornwall and brother of the
king, obtained a grant of the manor of Risborough, (fn. 37)
but after his death in 1337 (fn. 38) Queen Isabella again
held the manor. The reversion was granted to
Henry de Ferrers, (fn. 39) who obtained possession after
the death of Isabella, and died seised in 1344. (fn. 40)
His son was a minor, and the custody of the manor
was granted to the Black Prince, (fn. 41) from whom it
took its present name of Princes
Risborough. (fn. 42) The prince (fn. 43)
held the manor till his death,
when it passed to Richard his
son and heir. (fn. 44) The latter,
while still prince, granted the
manor for life to Lewis de
Clifford. (fn. 45) He confirmed the
grant on his accession to the
throne, and Lewis held it for
his life. Under Henry IV
the manor came into the hands
of the Crown, and was again
granted to the Prince of
Wales. (fn. 46) Henry VI succeeded
to the manor, (fn. 47) which formed part of the dower
of his queen, Margaret of Anjou. (fn. 48) Afterwards,
however, it seems to have been held by his son
Edward, Prince of Wales. (fn. 49) It remained in the
hands of the Crown apparently till Edward VI
granted the manor to Princess Elizabeth for life. (fn. 50)
James I granted it to Anne of Denmark as part of her
dower, (fn. 51) and on her death to Sir Henry Hobart to
the use of Prince Charles. (fn. 52) In 1628 Charles I conveyed the manor to the City of London in part payment of the large debts of the king. (fn. 53) The fee-farm
rent from the manor (fn. 54) was granted in 1671 to Lord
Hawley in trust for the king's heirs and successors, (fn. 55)
until it was sold. This sale took place in the same
year to Sir Peter Lely, (fn. 56) the painter. Under the
Commonwealth the manor of Princes Risborough,
distinguished at this time as the King's Manor, (fn. 57) came
into the hands of Ralph Adeane. (fn. 58) He held it in
1653 (fn. 59) and 1655, (fn. 60) and after the Restoration Thomas
Adeane, a minor, was lord of the manor as heir of
Ralph. (fn. 61) In 1684, however, Edward Bigland and
George Pelham appear to have been in seisin. (fn. 62) In
1702 and in 1729 Henry Penton held this manor (fn. 63)
In 1766 it was sold by the Penton family to John
Grubbe of Horsenden. (fn. 64) In the same year he, together
with his next brother Samuel, sold it to Edward, the
third brother. (fn. 65) Edward's grandson John held the
manor in 1813, (fn. 66) but in 1841 it was advertised for
sale by auction. (fn. 67) It was, however, purchased privately
by the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos on the day
previous to the sale. (fn. 68) The duke's lands were sold
very shortly after the purchase of this manor, which,
in 1862, was in the hands of Mr. James Cuddon (fn. 69)
At the present day Mr. Humphrey Brill, of Aston
Clinton, claims to be lord of the manor of Princes
Risborough.

This manor in Princes Risborough was held by
William de Similly by the service due from one
knight's fee, (fn. 70) and the same service was performed by
the Earls of Cornwall. (fn. 71) In later grants the service
is not defined. The lords of the manor under the
Commonwealth paid a fee-farm rent, which in 1671
was given as £82 4s. 7½d. (fn. 72) It is interesting to note
that this rent had hardly varied from the yearly value
of the manor 300 years before. In 1303 it was
£82 9s. 3d., (fn. 73) and in 1337 £84, (fn. 74) and 1381 £90. (fn. 75)
Earl Walter Giffard and Countess Ermengarde
granted a wood called Lullested in Princes Risborough
to the abbey of Notley, on its foundation. (fn. 76) This
grant was confirmed by Henry II and John and by
Edward III. (fn. 77)
In 1291 the temporalities of the abbey in Princes
Risborough were lands and meadows worth 12s. 9d.
a year. (fn. 78) The abbey probably obtained further grants
of land in the parish, since at the Dissolution it held
the manor and rectory of Princes Risborough, valued
at £40 a year. (fn. 79) Henry VIII granted this manor,
known as the ABBOT'S MANOR, to the dean and
chapter of Oxford, (fn. 80) but they forfeited it not long
afterwards. Edward VI on his accession to the
throne gave it to Robert King, Bishop of Oxford, (fn. 81)
but Elizabeth recovered the manor from the bishop in
1589. (fn. 82) In the same year she had already granted it
to Thomas Crompton, Robert Wrighte, and Gilley
Merick. (fn. 83) Crompton sold it to John Jackman, (fn. 84) who
held it at his death in 1622, (fn. 85) when it passed to his
son. The latter sold it in 1624 to Joan Chibnall
and Vincent Barry, (fn. 86) who was the steward of the
King's Manor. (fn. 87) During the Civil War this manor
presumably came into the hands of Ralph Adeane,
who certainly had the rectory. (fn. 88) In a suit as to
the customs of the manor in 1675, (fn. 89) the King's
Manor and the Abbot's Manor are both mentioned;
the former is said to belong to the ancient demense
of the Crown, and not the latter, but both seem to
be held by Thomas Adeane, and from this time continued to be held together.
In Elizabeth's grant to Thomas Crompton, (fn. 90) a
mansion-house called 'Broke House' is specially mentioned, and appears in the majority of the deeds relating to the manor. The latter indeed is sometimes
called Brooke, the description in 1813 (fn. 91) being the
'manor of Risborough or Princes Risborough or
Brooke or Abbot's Risborough commonly called the
Abbots' hold.' By Walter Giffard's grant the wood
was held by the abbey in frankalmoign, (fn. 92) and the
Bishop of Oxford held the manor in the reign of
Edward VI on the same tenure, but also paid rent
for it. (fn. 93)
CULVERTON is first mentioned in 1247. (fn. 94)
Stephen son of Hugh of Culverton then held 1 hide
of land of Philip son of Oliver. He had formerly
paid the yearly rent of 1 mark, but it was changed by
agreement to the payment of a clove gilly-flower
yearly. In 1317 Hugh of Culverton made an exchange of land in Princes Risborough with John de
Foxle and his wife Constance. Hugh by this settlement was to hold his land and tenements for life, with
remainder to John and Constance and the heirs of
John. (fn. 95) The other piece of land which changed
hands was to be held by John and Constance and the
heirs of John. (fn. 96) These arrangements suggest that
Constance was possibly the heiress of Hugh de Culverton. John de Foxle died, in 1324–5, seised jointly
with his wife of land at Culverton. (fn. 97) Constance
then held them alone and presumably was succeeded
by Thomas de Foxle. (fn. 98)
In the next century Richard de la Hay held the
manor of Culverton, which in 1443 was settled intact
on Matthew de la Hay and his wife Anne. (fn. 99) It was
sold in 1516–17 by Thomas a Botre and his wife
Joan to Robert Bonner. (fn. 100) It had apparently been
the inheritance of Joan. (fn. 101) In 1633–4 the manor of
Culverton alias Frogmore House passed from Charles
Alden and his wife Alice to Ralph Baldwin; (fn. 102) five
years later the latter conveyed it to Francis Steevens. (fn. 103)
John de Foxle held his land in Culverton of the king
in chief, of the manor of Princes Risborough. (fn. 104) He
did suit of court at Risborough every three weeks, and
paid a yearly rent of 33s. 9d. (fn. 105)
In 1316–17 the king granted him and his heirs the
right of free warren in all his demesne lands in Princes
Risborough and Saunderton. (fn. 106)
The manor of Princes Risborough
in 1086 was assessed at 30 hides, and
of these 20 were then contained
in the demesne of the king. (fn. 107) This suggests that
even in the 11th century the nucleus of a park
already existed, and a few years later the wood of
Earl Walter Giffard is mentioned in the foundation
charter of Notley Abbey. (fn. 108) The park is mentioned
in the inquisition taken at the death of Richard Earl
of Cornwall, (fn. 109) and the Abbot of Notley had various
rights in it, (fn. 110) to maintain which he was continually
making complaints to the king. (fn. 111) Edward II and
probably his predecessors used the park of Risborough
as a stud-farm. The buildings in the manor were
repaired in 1318, (fn. 112) so that the horses of the king's
stud could be properly kept there, and a special inclosure was made in which the horses might be
exercised. Orders were given that the keeper of the
stud should have whatever was required for the
horses. (fn. 113) The colts are particularly specified in some
of the orders, and in the appointment of William de
Framesworth as keeper of the stud it is specially mentioned that he was to have the custody of the colts as
well as of the horses already broken in. (fn. 114) The deer
in the park are also mentioned in 1337, (fn. 115) when
orders were given that thirty-two should be taken
from the parks of Risborough and Cippenham, and
sent to Westminster for the funeral expenses of John
Earl of Cornwall, the king's brother. The park was
however, always granted with the manor until
Henry VIII granted an inclosure, called Risborough
Park, to Sir Edward Don. (fn. 116) The Dons had already
held the parkership of Risborough; Edward IV had
granted it to Sir John Don, who retained his office
after the accession of Henry VII. (fn. 117) In 1520 the
office of parker was granted to Sir Edward himself, and
to Sir John Daunce in survivorship. (fn. 118) Sir Edward's
daughter and heiress Anne married George Cotton
of Whittington, (fn. 119) Gloucestershire, and she held
the park for her life. (fn. 120) The reversion, to fall in
after her death, was sold in 1562 by Edward
Daunce to Sir William Dormer. (fn. 121) Robert Lord
Dormer, the son of Sir William, died seised of the
Risborough Park (fn. 122) in 1617, his heir being his
grandson Robert, whose estates
were sequestered during the
Civil War. (fn. 123) In 1561 George
Gosnald, of Colston Basset,
Notts., obtained the estate of
Lord Dormer in Princes Risborough on a lease, paying
£230 a year. (fn. 124) Lord Dormer
was said to have held it at a
yearly rental of £100. (fn. 125) This
estate was not definitely called
the Park of Princes Risborough, but it seems probable that it may be identified
with it. No mention of the park is made after
the Restoration, and it seems to have been recovered by the lords of the manor. When Ralph
Adeane held the property in 1653 (fn. 126) there were 800
acres of wood and 60 of furze and heath attached to
the manor, the total acreage of land of all kinds being
1,360 acres, and rents being paid further to the value
of £15 a year. The Abbot's manor was not included
in this.
Dormer. Azure ten billets or and a chif or with a demi lion sable.
In the Domesday Book there were two mills at
Princes Risborough, worth 14s. 8d. a year. (fn. 127) They
may probably be identified with the two water-mills
mentioned in the reign of Henry III. Geoffrey
Neyrnut held one of these of the King of Almain,
then Richard Earl of Cornwall, the lord of the manor,
and the second of Richard de la Forde. (fn. 128) One
water-mill was held in the 17th century by William
Hampden. (fn. 129) It was left under his will to his cousin
Richard Hampden. (fn. 130) It was then called Longwick
Mill, a name which is still used for the water-mill in
the hamlet of Longwick at the present day. A watermill was also held by Robert Lord Dormer, early in
the 17th century, (fn. 131) and a water-mill and a windmill
are mentioned in 1712, being then in the possession
of Charles Dormer. (fn. 132)
In the 14th century there was a water-mill at
Culverton. (fn. 133) A mill was first mentioned in the
settlement made between Hugh of Culverton and
John de Foxle in 1317, (fn. 134) and the latter died seised
of a water-mill. (fn. 135) In the conveyances of the manor
of Culverton in the 17th century the water-mill
passed with the manor. (fn. 136)
The church of OUR LADY consists
of a chancel 32 ft. 9 in. by 17 ft. 10 in.,
with a modern organ chamber on the
north; a nave 60 ft. 9 in. by 26 ft. 3 in.; north and
south aisles 11 ft. 3 in. and 8 ft. wide respectively;
a south porch and a western tower. Up to the first
quarter of the 13th century the church consisted of
a chancel and an aisleless nave of the same width
as at present, but some 10 ft. shorter. About 1220
north and south aisles were added, and about 1300
the nave and aisles were lengthened by one bay, a
tower being probably begun at the same time. A
little later, in the 14th century, the chancel was rebuilt, and the clearstory was a 15th-century addition.
In modern times the church has been drastically restored, few of the windows remaining untouched.
The clearstory and north aisle were rebuilt, and the
east responds of the nave arcades, which were of
some depth, pierced with small arches in continuation
of the arcades. In 1907 a new tower and a tall
stone spire were begun from the designs of Mr. Oldrid
Scott.
The east window of the chancel is modern and
of geometrical detail. In the north wall is a muchrestored early 14th-century window of two uncusped
lights, with an uncusped circle over and shafts to the
internal splay. West of this is the opening to the
modern organ chamber. At the south-west of the
chancel is a trefoiled piscina, circa 1330, with a shelf
and a double drain. The two windows in the south
wall, of 14th-century style, and the door between
them, are all much restored but in part ancient
Below the western window is a blocked low side window, with a square head and plain chamfered jambs
and with its iron bars still in position. The chancel
arch is modern and of late 13th-century style.
The nave is of seven bays, and the two arcades are
practically identical, the arches throughout being of
two chamfered orders. The first arch on either side
is modern, and also the first column, circular in plan
and with moulded capital and base. The second,
third, fourth, and fifth columns and arches, and the
sixth arch are of 13th-century date, the columns being
octagonal and the arches having plain chamfered
labels, with moulded capitals and plain bases. The
seventh pair of arches, circa 1300, have a filleted roll
label, and the sixth columns and the western responds
are of the same time and are of quatrefoil plan, with
moulded capitals and bases of the same form and
date, but varying from each other in the details of
moulding. The tower arch is modern and of early
14th-century design. The clearstory has five modern
sixfoil circles on either side, and is shown by Lipscomb to have originally had two-light windows in
this position. (fn. 137)
The north aisle opens to the organ chamber by a
modern arch, and the north wall of the aisle has
been completely rebuilt; but in the main with old
materials. The windows are four in number, the
first two of three trefoiled lights with tracery over,
the others of two lights, and all with segmental heads
and of 14th-century detail. Some old stones are set
in their jambs and splays, but the tracery in all cases
is quite modern. The blocked north door in the
middle of this aisle is of 14th-century date but very
much restored, with continuously moulded jambs and
two-centred head of two orders. There is no west
window to either aisle.
The south aisle has a much-restored east window
of 14th-century date, with two uncusped lights. The
shafted jambs, mullion, and splays are old, and have
circular moulded capitals and bases. In the south
wall, at the east end, are a much-defaced piscina and
sedile of 14th-century date, with the remains of
elaborate projecting canopies with shafted jambs; in
the piscina is a stone shelf. Immediately west of this
is a very remarkable three-light window, which looks
like 13th-century work reused and altered circa 1320.
The lights are uncusped, and have a square inner
reveal and stilted moulded rear arches resting on freestanding shafts with octagonal moulded capitals; there
are engaged shafts to the tracery orders also. Partly
under this window is a 14th-century tomb recess with
a sub-cusped cinquefoiled ogee head, and another like
it to the west; both are now empty. Close to the
south door is a small plain much restored holy water
recess, and from this point to the sedile runs a stringcourse on the level of the sill to the window last described. The south door is of late 13th-century date,
with a deeply-moulded two-centred head and shafted
jambs with circular bases and capitals. West of the
south door is a window of three cinquefoiled lights,
repaired, but of 14th-century date, and there is a
contemporary moulded string-course forming its sill
and extending some distance on each side of it. Below are two tomb recesses similar to those already
described, but having shafted jambs.
The south porch is modern and has a small lancet
on either side.
The new western tower is of three stages, with
a tall stone spire, and incorporates the old tower,
which has been refaced.
The font is modern, with a plain octagonal bowl.
There are no monuments of interest in the church,
and the roofs and seating are modern. There is,
however, a 17th-century oak pulpit.
There is only one bell, dated 1838, and a small
'ting-tang,' dated 1805.
The church plate consists of a communion cup of
1752, given by Thomas Penn, rector; a plated paten;
and a flagon of 1629, given by Miss Mary Chibnall.
The first book of the registers contains baptisms
and marriages from 1561 to 1695 and burials from
1561 to 1678. Burials are continued in a second
book from 1678 to 1727, and baptisms and marriages
in a third from 1695 to 1721. A fourth book
contains baptisms and marriages from 1721 to 1754;
a fifth and sixth burials from 1721 to 1786 and
from 1786 to 1812. Baptisms, after a gap, are continued from 1788 to 1812, and three books containing
marriages with banns run from 1754 to 1776, from
1776 to 1803, and from 1803 to 1812.
The church of Princes Risborough
was granted by Walter Giffard to
Notley Abbey (fn. 138) at its foundation,
with the tithes of his demesne lands there. A vicarage, however, was not ordained. In 1258 the abbot
obtained leave from the pope that the churches and
chapels belonging to his abbey should be served by
the canons or other priests, who should be answerable
to the abbot and convent. (fn. 139) This method of serving
the churches caused various complaints in the 14th
and 15th centuries, (fn. 140) but the privilege was confirmed
by Boniface IX in 1402. (fn. 141) The rectory belonged to
the abbey of Notley at the dissolution of the monasteries. (fn. 142) It was afterwards granted by Henry VIII
to the Dean and Chapter of Oxford, (fn. 143) and was held
with the Abbot's Manor till the 19th century. A
vicarage is mentioned in the grants of Henry VIII (fn. 144)
and Edward VI, (fn. 145) but this was probably a mistake.
The advowson of the church was granted with the
rectory to Thomas Crampton, (fn. 146) and the church was
served by a perpetual curate appointed by the impropriator of the rectory. The patronage was transferred
to the Bishop of Oxford in 1860, (fn. 147) and finally the
benefice was declared a rectory in 1868. (fn. 148)
A chapel of St. John the Evangelist was built at
Lacey Green early in the 19th century, (fn. 149) the plan
being mainly carried through by the exertions of the
Rev. Richard Meade, rector of Horsenden and perpetual curate of Princes Risborough. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1825.
The hamlet, with Looseley Row and Speen, was,
however, formed into an ecclesiastical parish in 1851; (fn. 150)
the living is a vicarage in the gift of the rector of
Princes Risborough.
The Abbot of Notley, at the time of the Dissolution, was bound to distribute certain charities to
various poor persons at the church of Princes Risborough, to the value of 20s. a year, for the benefit of
the souls of the Earl Walter Giffard and the Countess
Ermengarde. (fn. 151) An acre of land was also granted to
provide a light at Princes Risborough, presumably
within the church. (fn. 152) A Baptist chapel was built in
1707 in Bell Street, and a second chapel was opened
at Looseley Row in 1862. There is a branch of the
Bell Street chapel at Longwick, where there is also a
Wesleyan chapel. The Wesleyan Methodists have a
chapel in Princes Risborough, built in 1869. At
Speen there is a Baptist chapel opened in 1813, and
the Primitive Methodists have a chapel at Lacey
Green.
For many years there was an ancient custom at
Princes Risborough by which the impropriator gave a
bull and a boar on Christmas Day for the use of his
parishioners. They were distributed 'in large pieces,
smoking hot from the copper at five o'clock in the
morning for breakfast on Christmas Day.' (fn. 153) Four
bushels of wheat and four bushels of malt were also
made into bread and beer and given away. The
custom however was given up before 1847. (fn. 154)
In 1615–16 William Smith by his
will left £40 for the use of the poor.
The legacy was laid out in land, in
respect of which 3 a. 2 r. 36 p. in Near Side Field
were allotted on the inclosure in 1820. The land
is let in allotments, producing about £7 a year, which
is applied in the distribution of money, 2s. 6d. to
each recipient.
An annual payment of £32 a year is made by Lord
Rothschild out of the Manor Farm, Tring, in respect
of Joan Chibnall's Charity, by will, 1646, for providing gowns, &c., for poor widows or ancient ladies of
Princes Risborough, and other parishes in this county
and Oxford. In 1905 thirteen women of this parish
were provided with gowns at a cost of £8; 2s. were
given to fifty-one recipients and 10s. paid to the
rector for a sermon.
In 1684 Thomas Meade left £100 to be laid out
in land, the rents and profits to be applied in apprenticing to trades (except husbandry). The legacy was
laid out in the purchase of land, in respect of which
at the inclosure in 1820, 3 a. or. 10 p. in Near Side
Field were allotted for the poor. The land is let at
£3 10s. a year.
In 1713 Mrs. Katherine Pye by deed settled lands
in Towersey for educational and eleemosynary purposes in the parishes of Bradenham, Towersey,
Princes Risborough, Hughenden, and West Wycombe.
The land, known as Quash Farm, contains about fiftythree acres awarded under the Towersey Inclosure Act,
1822, producing a net income of about £60 a year.
By an order of the Charity Commissioners, dated 15
March 1904, made under the Board of Education
Act, 1899, the part of the endowment applicable for
educational purposes was determined to be an annual
sum of £36 for schooling certain children of the said
parishes, and an annual sum of £1 1s. 8d. for books
for such children leaving school. The yearly sum of
£12 is payable under the deed of foundation to six
poor widows, or widows and maids of Bradenham,
Towersey, and West Wycombe, 40s. to each; £5 to
the treasurer, and 40s. for the expenses of the trustees,
and the surplusage, if any, in apprenticing.
The sum of £8 10s. is received as the share of
Princes Risborough, and applied to general school
expenses.
In 1772 Richard Stratton by will bequeathed
£500 to the governors of Christ's Hospital, to secure
the nomination of one poor boy belonging to Princes
Risborough.
Elizabeth Eustace, by deed 5 July 1784, gave certain lands for providing 'lots of linen' for the poor.
On the inclosure 1 a. o r. 27 p. were allotted in respect
thereof, which is let at £4 10s. a year, of which the
sum of £1 3s. is paid to the parish of Bledlow. In
1905 linen to the value of 5s. was given to each of
twelve recipients, and 1s. was retained by each of the
five trustees in pursuance of the provisions of the deed.
The Poor's Land allotted on the inclosure contains
39 a. 3 r. 11 p., let to fifteen tenants at £30 a year.
The net proceeds are distributed in coal among the
cottagers.
The Church Land consists of 32 p. at Longwick,
let at £1 1s. a year, which is applied towards the
church expenses.
The Baptist Chapel in Bell Street, erected in 1707,
in addition to the Minister's House, is possessed of a
house at Parkfield, let at £12 a year. By an order
of the Charity Commissioners, dated 11 March 1898,
new trustees of the trust property, including the old
and new burial-ground, were appointed.

Sheepshead Bay will soon have its supermarket back, thanks to the efforts of Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz and the LeFrak Organization.
ALDI Food Market has signed a 10-year lease with LeFrak for the 18,481-square-foot space formerly occupied by a Pathmark grocery store at 3785 Nostrand Ave. It is slated to open in late 2013.
According to Markowitz, this is the first store in Brooklyn and fourth citywide for the store that will offer customers more than 1,400 of the most frequently purchased items sold under ALDI exclusive brands for much less.
“The preservation and creation of supermarkets has been, and continues to be, a top priority of my office,” said Markowitz, who was joined in making the announcement last Friday by state
Assembly member Helene Weinstein, City Council member Lew Fidler and Theresa Scavo, district manager of Community Board 15.
Described as a retailer that has grown without mergers or acquisitions, ALDI opened 75 stores in the U.S. in 2011 and plans to open 80 more in 2012.
Other city locations are in Rego Park (61-11 Junction Blvd.), the Bronx (1750 E Gun Hill Rd.) and a recently opened one in Manhattan (517 East 117th St.).
“We are looking forward to bringing our first store to the Brooklyn community and helping customers stretch their dollars even further,” said Bruce Persohn, a division vice president for ALDI. “Once open, we will challenge shoppers to switch from national brands to our exclusive brands and save up to 50 percent without compromising quality.”
Commented Marylou Berk, head of commercial real estate for LeFrak, “Everyone [at LeFrak] is excited to have brought ALDI to the Sheepshead Bay community. Residents in this area are looking forward to having a grocery chain that offers high-quality items at unbeatable prices.”
Michael Stone of Cushman and Wakefield represented the shopping center. The tenant was represented by Esther Bukai of Ripco Real Estate.

On Sunday, Nov. 18, at 3 p.m., Brooklyn Friends of Chamber Music (BFCM) and the Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra present a joint concert to honor the memory of Justice Gustin L. Reichbach (1946-2012) and Hope (1988-2011), daughter of Justice Reichbach and Ellen Meyers.
The concert will take place at The Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, Clinton and Montague streets in Brooklyn Heights.
Engaged with radical politics at Columbia University School of Law, Justice Gustin Reichbach led student protests in 1968 and went on to a career as a fiercely independent lawyer and judge. He won a court case that helped legalize residential loft life in Soho and TriBeCa, blasted a state agency from the bench for ignoring Medicaid fraud and served as a judge on a war-crimes tribunal in Kosovo. He provided prostitutes with condoms, H.I.V. testing and counseling. To his delight, the Daily News called him the Condom Judge on its front page.
Hon. Barry Kamins, administrative judge for Criminal Matters, Second Judicial District, said, "The concert is a wonderful way to honor the memory of Judge Reichbach and his daughter Hope. Judge Reichbach was a man of great integrity and behind his love of the law, he enjoyed the arts and music and this is a great way to celebrate his life."
Justice David Schmidt of Brooklyn Supreme Court (Civil Term) said of Judge Reichbach:  Deborah Dowling of Brooklyn Supreme Court (Criminal Term) said, "Judge Reichbach was always a man of principle who was unafraid to look at things, including the law, in an unconventional way. He truly was a catalyst for change both in his professional and personal life."
In May, Justice Reichbach wrote an op-ed article in The New York Times pleading for the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. He himself was using it to ease his cancer treatments. Justice Reichbach died of pancreatic cancer in July 2012.
Hope Reichbach grew up in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College High School. In her senior year she teamed up with the New York Civil Liberties Union to sue then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for what she believed to be his illegal military recruitment tactics.
City Councilman Steve Levin made Hope his communications director, and, at age 22, Hope ran for female district leader. She was recognized as a rising star in Brooklyn politics, but died in April 2011.
For friends, family and members of the Brooklyn community, this concert will hold a special meaning as Justice Reichbach had hoped to serve as narrator for the Beavers concerto. Actor Harris Yulin will take his place.
All proceeds from this concert will be donated to the Hope Reichbach Memorial Fund, which provides scholarships for students in civic leadership and grassroots community organizing.
The program will include Felix Mendelssohn, “Octet in E-flat major, Op. 20” and Kevin Beavers “Roscoe Concerto for Violin, Narrator and Orchestra on a Text by William Kennedy.”
The musicians include these faculty and students of the Manhattan School of Music: Christina Bouey, Xiao Wang, Holly Jenkins, Karen Dekker, violins; Celia Hatton, Nicholas Mann, violas; Grace Ho, David Geber, cellos.
The Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra will also perform with J. Freivogel, first violinist of the Jasper Quintet, on violin.
Harris Yulin's last stage appearance was as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's “Death of a Salesman” at the Gate Theatre, Dublin. His production of Horton Foote's “The Trip to Bountiful” at the Signature Theatre won four Lortel awards (including direction), in an extended run.
The Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1973 and is comprised of talented amateur, semi-professional, and professional musicians. Nicholas Armstrong has been its Artistic Director since 1997. He is Head of the Performing Arts Department at the Poly Prep School.
Tickets are $20 at the door, students $10. For more information, call (718) 855-3053.

Lucky you, that’s about the closest to the real thing a “mortal” like us could experience.
( Well, except for that Tom Verducci thing )
Playing on those fields ( Fenway and Yankee Stadium ) must be an incredible sensation, even for a beat writer that’s used to be there. Good for you and your son.
Nice job Ian! It’s about time you guys won! What a great picture of Tyler!
~Molly
Unlike many of my fellow bloggers here, i’m not a Coco hater. But man ! was it a poor and lazy relay to the infield on the Posada double. Should’ve been an out at second ( or just a single ).
And now he’s at 3rd base with 1 out.
ATTABOY DUSTIN !! Is he hot or what ?!
Is it just me or has Dustin really stepped up a notch in the field and at the plate since people were questioning his starting place in the team? The pressure seems to have invigorated him. 5-4 lead now thanks to Youk.
I just think that he was in the bottom part of the learning curve. Somewhat normal for a rookie..
Yes, I noticed that Crisp really dogged that Posada double.
Notice they didn’t show a clear replay of that play at the plate. Looked like Lugo might have snuck in.
Did you hear they finally diagnosed Clemen’s ailment? It’s called… “WaitingForAnNLCentralPatsy-itis of the groin”
How come Miller and Morgan were talking about a blown save by Oki ? We’re in 8th inning, for god sake ! It’s a blown lead, not a blown save !
cause jon miller is just annoying and morgan has diarehha of the mouth. he always needs something to talk about
sadly he was right, it is a blown save technically. Hence why Proctor had 7 last year, despite having only two in the 9th inning.
Lugo was out, they showed the replay, it was clear, posada just did a great job blocking the plate, more lucky than anything else.
Where is the line ? When does it stop being a blown lead to turn into a blown save ? From the start of the 8th on ?
Keep the faith, everyone. It’s Papi, Manny and Youk in the bottom 9th. Against Mo. That’s what makes baseball so exciting.
Rough game, gotta keep it in perspective though: 12.5 games.
The only thing I’m weary of is that we are running into a hot pitcher in Haren while putting Tavarez on the hill, the Sox have to be careful not to fall into those 1-2 game hangovers after an intense series with the Yankees.
I’m not too worried about Okajima or Papelbon. Oki shut the Yanks down with a man on 3rd and no outs, and A-Rod did a good job of taking the outside fastball the other way. Although Paps should have at least wasted a splitter with an 0-2 count, but hindsight is 20/20.
See them in August.
I gotta tell you Papelbon has been kinda ******* me off. I might be saying this only cuz he gave up the homer, but the entire year he has only been pitching fastballs. I’m not even sure he knows how to throw a split or slider anymore.
rsox: anytime you come in in a save situation and the opponent ties the game, it’s a blown save. So, say we had gotten a run bottom 8th. Pap would have gotten a blown save when he served up Arod’s homer. It’s possible to have more than one blown saves in the game (and it’s possible to have pitchers on both teams blow saves).
penwhale, i know all that.
I just thought that it wasn’t a save situation before the 9th inning. If a reliever blows out a 2 run lead in the 6th inning, is it a blown save ? I though it was a simple blown lead.
I mean, is it a save situation as soon as a reliever enters the game with a 3 run lead or less ( or with a bigger lead that shrinks into a 3 run lead ) ?
That’s kind of unfair for the set up men everywhere. They could end up with a blown save if they fail, but if they hold on, someone else ( the closer ) will come and get the save in the 9th. I just think that’s a weird rule.
Papelbon needs to learn how to waste a pitch… maybe something that looks decent and then breaks out of the zone. He has been hit on a few 0-2 counts where he just grooves one for the heck of it.
I think we hit the ball hard all night and just didn’t get the breaks. Knowing how shallow they play Pedroia to right… I have no idea how Abreau tracked that one down.
Bad call by our third base coach on Lugo. If you see the replay, Jeter takes the cutoff as Lugo is barely rounding third. It was a very high throw, but he was still out. Why not give Papi/Manny a chance to break the game open against maybe the worst pitcher in all of baseball (Vizcaino – already 2 hits and 2 walks in the game).
I can’t remember the last time Crisp or Lugo hit the ball hard. At best its a bloop or a grounder with eyes.
I’m a little worried about Papi’s hamstrings. Although his drive off Rivera in the ninth was gone in any other park.
rsox 34:
Here is the official rule on saves.
For many of the scoring rules, you can come up with situations that don’t seem fair, and the save rule is a good example.
On Joe Morgan:
Usually, his self-contradictions make me shake my head in disgust. Last night he was so ridiculous at one point I laughed out loud. Early in the game he makes a comment about Pettite being easy to steal on because he’s so slow to the plate. Then later, when they had Lugo picked off, but he was safe because of Phelps’ throw, Morgan says Pettite is tough to steal against because of his great pick-off move. It’s almost as if as soon as something comes out of the guy’s mouth he forgets he said it.
Lugo’s getting called out at the plate was a combination of a slightly risky send by Demarlo Hale, a good play by Posada to get the tag on Lugo, and Lugo’s failure to make a better slide. I think Posada got a little lucky, in that he happened to come down in just the right spot, just in time to block Lugo’s foot, but he got the tag down very quickly. If Lugo had slid a little to the left and tagged the plate with his hand, he’s probably safe. Hindsight being what it is, and Lugo having only a split second to react to Posada being pulled off the plate by the throw, I can’t really fault him or Hale.
Oh, and Ian, I’m glad you told us Tyler was your son. I never would have guessed that, since he doesn’t look ANYTHING like you.
“That’s kind of unfair for the set up men everywhere. They could end up with a blown save if they fail, but if they hold on, someone else ( the closer ) will come and get the save in the 9th. I just think that’s a weird rule”
You’re right about that, rsox. The reason the rule is like that is because back in the 70′s and earlier you had closers like Goose Gossage that would go regularly for 3 inning saves. Times have changed.
The converse is true as well. I remember a game a couple of years ago in which Alan Embree left Mike Timlin with a bases loaded, no out jam with a one run lead. Timlin gets two outs before allowing just one run to score, and then getting the third out to end the inning. As I recall, Timlin didn’t even allow anyone to reach first, the run coming on a sac fly. Timlin got the blown save, but it was mostly Embree’s fault. Tough to write a rule that is fair in every possible situation.
As far as the set up man not getting any credit in rsox’s example, at least they’ve started recording holds, so there is a statistic to show the contribution of the set up men. Not as sexy as a save, but those who take the time to look at all of the stats can see how well the middle relievers are helping the cause of the team.
Thanks rob, btide and penwhale.
I just hope the middle relievers take the time to include the Hs as bonuses when signing a new deal !!!!
Another example was Mo Rivera – when the Yankees had a one run lead in the bottom of the 8th with runners on the corners and no-one out (Gordon’s mess), he came in and ggave up a saac fly to Varitek but got a blown save for it. Seems very unfair to me.
The ESPN guys were terrible. I didn’t like A-Rod’s play at all in Toronto but they spoke at it, and A-Rod’s other escapades, for what seemed like two full innings. What a joke. They barely commentated on the game itself on what was a great game.
Tonight could be a loooong, short night for the Sox. We are throwing the “B” team out there (no Tek, Lowell and dare I say Lugo) against the Cy Young winner for the first 2 months. Whoever came up with this schedule did a horrible job, there was no reason for New York to fly halfway acorss the country to play tonight much less Boston who has to fly coast-to-coast. Yankees are feeling the effects losing by 4 in the 7th, I have to think we will be viewing similar results soon.
Let’s all say our prayers that this is the last start we ever see Tavarez pitch. Lester had a nice 7 inning start… seems like he is ready. How long do we keep a 5.50 ERA bum in our rotation? Given how tired the Redsox are, wouldn’t it have made more sense to just forfeit this game and rest our guys?
Rayman, thats a little harsh for Tavarez. The ERA is high because of his first handful of starts, its around 4 in the last couple months. I’d prefer EZ in the rotation over Wake who can’t throw strikes. Let him work it out in the pen when Lester comes back.
I mean around 4 in the last month
I am counting on the vast knowledge of my brainy blog brethren. Can anyone confirm if the 1978 home record for the Sox (63-19) is the best since MLB when to the 162-game format? Also, alluding back to Rayman’s comment, I agree that Papelbon could have wasted a pitch or two on Arod. It is so frustrating to see an opposing player homer on an 0-2 pitch. Pap’s 2 plus era is still impressive but he could really dominate with that talent.
Since I was hardly a blip on the Earth radar akihiro, I am unsure whether or not that is the best ever. Were they that good at home? That is one helluva record
I think we are in trouble with both Wake and Tavarez. I really doubt Tavarez is going to get below 5.00 ERA as a starter. I think Wake doesn’t get any breaks from the umps. If its not a perfect strike, they never give him a call. Add in the wild pitches, the easy steals, and the wasted lineup spot (Mirabelli) and its not a pretty picture. We need Lester badly and I wouldn’t hesitate to look around the minors for some additional help.
Yep, Rizzo. I recall they were like under .500 on the road but were unbelievable at home. 99 wins that year. By the way, just call me Paul.
9 hits and 2 walks given up to the worst hitting team in the league. That’s Tavarez. It is really painful to play the A’s… they have 1 good hitter in the entire lineup and always to seem to score runs against us.
Wily Mo needs to be traded before he loses whatever value he has left. His defense in the outfield is an absolute joke. He has let two balls get by him in this game alone to allow the A’s to go for extra bases.
It’d be one thing if he was hitting while playing a below-average outfield, but striking out roughly every 3 at-bats is obviously not going to get it done, nor is a glaring inability to hit the breaking ball which every pitcher in the AL is aware of.
The Reds made out like bandits with the Pena-for-Arroyo deal: they got a rubber arm with big game experience while the Sox received a “future slugger” who swings a bat with holes in it.
I really am losing patience with those whole “wait and see” approach the Red Sox are taking with him, I understand he’s young but right now I would much rather see Hinske as the 4th outfielder. At least he has proven he can play (2002 Rookie of the Year) whereas we are waiting on Pena based off of potential alone.
And yes, he just went deep.
But I maintain my point, he doesn’t hit enough to make up for his ugly defense.
…now I wish there was a delete feature on this thing.
I’m glad Pena is proving me wrong.
(Although if Crisp wasn’t running on that play, it’s a groundout to the 2B, but that’s not important).
What a good game other than the result. So many things pointed towards a win (tying up the game in dramatic fashion, escaping the jam in the 9th)
Yet other parts pointed towards a loss (giving up the cycle, couldn’t score in extras, pedroia out at home)
Im glad the sox fought the entire time, they could have just said it was too late and they were too tired to play. This still blows I wanted a win.
lol….zach, thanx your comments made my morning. Keep the wmp dissing up and maybe he will keep the hitting up. His defense is brutal however, but I can see how he might be a good hitter down the road. Seems to me when he plays it takes him a few games to find his swing, he gets hot, and he’s back out of the line-up. Good game last night, crappy results. Haven’t really tracked or noticed the A’s beating us up over the past few years, I do know we have done that to them in the playoffs when it counts. How does Kotsay have such a great BA against us career wise. He must have played for those Blue Jays at one point. Seems all those guys come up big against us too. Didn’t mind the commentary last night, way better then the espn game Sunday. Well which Dice-K is going to show up tonight…I’m hedging on the good one, but have decided not to play him in my pool for the first time this season. I actually put the Big Unit in tonight.
You’re right Alex, Sox played a gutsy game. It would have been a great win. Even though he gave up the home run to Chavez, Kyle Snyder did a nice job. Unlike those before him, at least he came in and threw strikes. How much trouble were the Sox pitchers in all night because of walks. It’s a rather disturbing trend. Even Pap is walking a lot of people and getting into trouble and throwing more pitches than he needs to.
I’m really proud of Julian Tavarez. It looked like disaster time for him tonight, and he came back and gave the Sox some quality innings. While his stats aren’t all that great, he has pitched some gutsy games this year. He’s also so entertaining to watch.
Dice-K needs to crank it up tonight. Sox have lost 4 of 5 and need to start winning again. He needs to be a stopper here. Fortunately, none of the other division rivals are winning much either. Sox have played pretty solid consistent baseball, but have not really put a run together yet. If they do that once, the could wrap things up early.
Great outing by Jon Lester. Maybe we’ll see him back in a couple of weeks.
That’s the type of close game I haven’t seen in a long while. Gutsy game by our boys, although it stinks they came out on the wrong end. Honestly, I had my hope up for an Ortiz homer and we almost got one. Then Chavez had to come out and ruin it.
Tavarez had came out and given us a great chance most of the time to let us win ballgames. It’s just that he’s been matched up with the opposing team’s best pitcher almost everytime (e.g. Haren, Santana), so it makes it that much harder to get some runs on the board. Honestly, I’d be more worried about Wake. Like Rizzo said, he hasn’t been throwing strikes as of late. I hope it’s just some mechanical issue that can be worked out.
Wily Mo coming up big…that’s just what I wanted to see.
He needs to be in games more often so he can get better. Maybe we’re keeping him around so once Ortiz retires (which I hope is never, lol), we have another power hitting DH? No idea, but if we could trade him for someone, who and what position?
Here’s to hoping we see a 10-K Dice-K tonight.
zachary:
I have been of the opinion that Hinske should get more playing time in the outfield as well. Then I looked at his offensive stats and was surprised to see how much worse they are than Pena’s.
Pena
AB: 75 AVG: .240 OPS: .767 TB: 34 SO: 29
Hinske
AB: 59 AVG: .155 OPS: .547 TB: 17 SO: 15
Hinske sort of peaked in late April, when his average was up around .500, but he’s been on a steady decline. Who knows, with a few more consistent plate appearances, maybe he could pick it up. And of course there’s the glaring disparity in the SO column.
The tough thing to quantify is how much of Pena’s production is offset by his defensive play. His fielding percentage is .923, pretty low compared to the rest of the team, but how many runs has he directly allowed to score? Last night was ugly, but I don’t have any stats for the season in that regard. (Hinske has a 1.000 fielding percentage in the outfield, but that’s with only 9 total chances. His fielding percentage at first base is .970.)
Personally, I like Hinske a lot. Great team player, and seems to have come up with some clutch hits and plays so far this year. I agree that he’s worth giving some more playing time.

Clock Tower Penthouse
cabbagerose: This place is insanely awesome. Who wouldn’t want to live in an awesome clock tower penthouse with that view of Brooklyn. If you want it the price is only a cool $25 mill. I wonder if that clock is loud? via: twobrunettes cabbagerose: Oh my! The view…the staircase…the clock

I mentioned that to someone yesterday and apparently our local banks are also doing it. One that I heard was that you can skip this month's repayment and they will recoup it from your bonus pay. I think this probably works only for government officers. All these are presumably again because of the expectation of high expenses of the coming Hari Raya celebrations. Even JPKE is also using this opportunity to launch Brunei's Grand Sales throughout the whole month.
That seemed to be an interesting phenomenon. Why suddenly spend during Hari Raya? We got caught up in it as well. We decided to change our curtains which are now ten years old. My wife and I have talked about it for quite a while but it seems that we have decided to choose now as a good time to do it. Why now? I guess Raya is coming, that seems to be the underlying thinking. Most of us tend to use Hari Raya as the time to do the things that probably ought to be done. Other than that, there is the usual Baju Raya, Kueh Raya etc that needed to be bought in expectation of the many people that will turn up at our houses during Hari Raya. The number of new cars will also increase. Some of the guests that come over inevitably will be driving in their new cars.
New cars, new things during Hari Raya. I guess it's okay if you can afford it. But even then, this is already bordering on the line of wastage. Yesterday's Brunei Times led with an interesting article about not splurging during Hari Raya as it is sinful. Some have argued that they only spend once a year and it is usually during Hari Raya. Besides we should celebrate the month after fasting for a whole month. Again some would say that beats the original purpose of fasting which is to feel deprived and to make one feel humble. What's your take on this?
14 comments:
for me i wish ramadhan is celebrated as meriah as syawal and sultan's birthday or hari kebangsaan. why i say is that: Bulan ramadhan is the time where every muslim should look forward with excitement not just with amalan di waktu malam but to show how much we appreciate and celebrate it why not have the bandar and towns lighted up with the glittery cuculs?at least when little kids asked "mama kenapa bandar ani bercucul2 ani?" we can answer because we are celebrating the holy and beautiful month of ramadhan. macam di negeri singapore (or others) kalau they want to celebrate christmas a month before sudah tia orchard road atu meriah to welcome christmas
my point maybe not agreeable to some but seriously kalau on the way or balik dari masjid siuk jua meliat di keliling bandar lawa and terang-benderang, apatah lagi sepuluh malam terakhir tengah malam on the way kemasjid kan sembahyang tasbih
Sorry,my point above kind of "menyimpang sikit" but it was because of how we want to make the syawal and ramadhan celebration more festive-ised<---i made the word up!
By the way,How about the muslim arabs or chinese?how do they celebrate syawal?is it like us here where we highlight it with open houses, extravagant baju melayu/kurong, cars, curtain, furniture, food?
As mentioned by anonymous, it will be great if Bandar or commercial areas are lighten up during this hari raya,like the ones in singapore,(geylang areas) to celebrate this special occasions,hope the people at municipal board will look into this,and i do hope Mr.BR, will convey this to you know who.Again,Thank you MR.BR for filling my early morning reads with all your blogs.Lastly spend less and give more to the needy during this festive season,as again thats why we fast in the first place anyway, to be humble and feels what the poor is feeling,to repent to Allah All mighty.
I think the purpose of raya is to strengthen tali silaturrahim is it not? All the pomp and circumstance we inject is just our own flavour and part of Bruneian culture rather than the arbitrary mode of celebration elsewhere. After all, where else do festivities last the entirety of Syawal?
All that said, I can't wait for Raya;)
I think it's ridiculous how wasteful we are during Ramadhan. And when Syawal comes, it's even outrageous.
How can we justify spending so much money on food, clothes, cars and curtains and charge it all on credit or cash that should be going to charities and needy people?
Ramadhan is a time to abstain oneself not just from consuming food but also from our overindulgence. And moderation is the key. Eid is a time for celebration after Ramadhan but to spend excessively is not exactly the way to go.
We should be self-critical of ourselves and think whether what we are buying is what we need or maybe it's just what we want.
I was about to indulge myself on a new digital camera because the latch on my old digital camera is broken. But i've saved myself approximately $500 by using tape to patch it up.
Sigh.. but nothing is happening when it comes to "Chinese New Year".
How unfair could that be?
Thanks Mr BR for posting on the useless wastage we Bruneians seem to always do around Hari Raya. I am always surprised to see people spend so much money when they could be putting it to better use (their children's education say OR payment towards last year's Hari Raya bils).
I have always thought that Hari Raya was a celebration to reward those wh chose to do without during Ramadan as a reminder that not everyone is fortunate. Isn't it ironic that Bruneians celebrate this fact with an entire month of needless festivities? Isn't an importane lesson of Islam moderation?
is it necessary to buy new things for hariraya? i still don't understand why people have to change the curtains and sofas etc when the old ones can still be used... the same goes with the bajus, women with their thick 'katuk' and 'kisi' which cost hundreds of dollars... please, it's wasting money when we should be berjimat cermat... bersederhanalah dalam kehidupan... i know some of the bruneians are rich people, berkemampuan and everything, but that's not the reasons to throw your money over something which are not necessary...
this is my personal opinion. after spending 8 years in the uK, i've stop enjoying the festivities. some would disagree, but i find it to be stupid and waste of time.
why is it during raya, people try have the prettiest of everything ? whats the point ? to prove that you're richer and better than the less significant other ?
why is it during raya, majority of the people who comes are the ones i've never met before ? and if i've never met them before, why do they come and ask for forgiveness?
if it's a tradition, then this tradition is "empty". its like a parrot immitating it's master. not knowing what it's saying. such as raya-ers, coming over to people houses eating food, adoring the view of the priceless chandelier and minta maaf zahir batin.
why is it every raya, they PLAY THE SAME MUSIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN. it's annoying. even when i was in the UK, these annoying music found their way through internet to torture me mentally.
i have to stress that I prefer the way Christians spend Christmas. One special day. Close family and relatives ONLY.
But malay, WHOA, one whole month. And it's every year!
Calculate the amout of money, time and effort wasted. I can get myself 10 containers full of ciggarettes!
note : this is my own opinion
my mom feels the need to buy new furniture, curtains and other items for every chinese new year, which is a waste of money, in my opinion. we now have a room full of unwanted bedside tables, beds, sofas, chairs, desks, pillows and lamps. festivities should be about celebrating with family and friends (which is free), and not about how different the home looks compared to the previous year (which is taxing).
i think its important as muslims that we must remain humble and not be too materialistic. at the end of the day, what can we do with the nice things we have? We certainly can't bring it with us when we die and it certainly doesnt count for anything on the day of judgement. Alot of us sadly have forgotten this. Dont you think god would be much more pleased if we celebrated the end of the fasting month with humbleness because isnt that what islam teaches?

Mach manages tasks and threads; UN*X processes are built atop Mach tasks, and pthreads are built atop Mach threads. The "BSD kernel" part of XNU (under the bsd subdirectory) is what implements the "UN*X processes" stuff (among other things, such as the file system and networking mechanisms), and that code runs in both the "kernel task" (the UN*X process for which is pid 0) and in other tasks; it doesn't run in "a" process/task in the sense of "it runs in a single process/task".
Not sure if it was ripped from FreeBSD or NetBSD.
The from-BSD parts of the "BSD kernel" are mostly taken from FreeBSD, but have changed significantly, and the "BSD kernel" has a fair bit of Apple code in it, as well as, for example, Sun (Open Solaris) code (as in "DTrace").

It's probably not what you'd want for a desktop system. It will run all the server stuff you listed just fine. The system compiler is gcc, although it likely comes with BSD make, so you'll want to install GNU make for compiling some software (usually it doesn't make a difference, but some projects rely on GNU make).
Packaging is similar to Slackware's package system (or at least how it used to be - I haven't use Slack in years) - it's tarball based. There is the pkgsrc system where you can automatically download and compile software for the system (based off FreeBSD's port system, which I rather like). You can also download and recompile the entire OS if you want (the infamous "make world" on FreeBSD, although glancing at the docs it seems NetBSD doesn't use that exact term).
Binary updates are generally available for security or bugfixes. The system doesn't do this for you (unless you recompile the system from source regularly - see below), so you have to check the errata page often to see if you need to update something. If you do, it's generally as simple as downloading the new binary and installing it using the system install tool.
Source updates are done on CVS trees - you track one of the trees (STABLE or CURRENT) and you get updates. The BSDs differ a bit where this is concerned, so I can't really give any specifics, but on FreeBSD and OpenBSD it's relatively painless once you get it set up. There's a utility to help you update your configuration files in FreeBSD and OpenBSD, so I assume NetBSD has something similar.
It supports CARP if you want to do clustering. I'm not sure if that will cover your needs, but if not, OpenBSD or FreeBSD might. I can attest that netbooting OpenBSD is cake - my firewall runs diskless.
As far as my experiences, well, there's a bit of a learning curve. It's easier if you've worked with Slackware or some other source-heavy Linux distro. The BSDs have a very unified feel to them, probably because there's no separation of userland and kernel development - the base system is developed as one unit, not a bunch of different projects. Like with anything, you have to use it a while to get a feel for it.
I like it. It's not as stuffy as Solaris, but it has a more consistant feel than Linux. Documentation is usually excellent, and the man pages are the definitive resource and usually include examples and explainations. I use OpenBSD for my firewall and nameserver, and FreeBSD for my file/webserver (due to ZFS and better Java support). I would use FreeBSD as a professional workstation (as long as it didn't require heavy 3D work), but not for my home machine.
If you've got the time to put into learning it (which if you know your stuff from Linux, it won't take long), it's well worth it. Throw it on a server and use it for a bit, and see what you think.

Ohio State linebacker Etienne Sabino had his left arm in a sling yesterday at the team’s annual picture day, after breaking a bone in his hand in Saturday’s scrimmage, but said he still plans to be in the lineup in the season opener Sept. 3 against Akron.
“The doctor said I should be good to go. I just have to play with a cast on,” Sabino said. “I’ll be out about a week or so.”
To aid the cause, the junior said, doctors added some hardware to help stabilize the fractured bone of his index finger during surgery yesterday morning at the Ohio State Medical Center. The injury happened early in Saturday’s scrimmage, not that Sabino noticed.
“Coming off a block, I think my hand got caught in a face mask,” he said. “I kept playing because I didn’t think it was anything big. It ended up being broken.”
Coming off a redshirt season, the fourth-year junior has been part of the three-man starting corps at linebacker, taking the spot on the strong side next to middle linebacker Storm Klein and weak-side linebacker Andrew Sweat. With Sabino likely missing at least a week, the coaches probably will move Tony Jackson, Nate Oliver and perhaps freshmen Curtis Grant and Ryan Shazier more into the mix.
Coach Luke Fickell said yesterday he still wasn’t ready to declare a winner of Saturday’s jersey scrimmage, at least to the media. But it was going to be a subject of interest during the team meeting last night.
“We’ll go through all the situations and stuff before we make any decisions or proclamations or announcements as to who would be wearing the scarlet jersey,” Fickell said. The winner — the offense or the defense — has rights to the coveted scarlet practice jerseys the rest of the fall.
Running back Jaamal Berry, competing for the starting spot, was nursing a hamstring pull that kept him out of much of practice last week plus the scrimmage. Nickel back Tyler Moeller was sidelined by a strained groin muscle. Both expect to be back this week.
Moeller was granted a sixth year of eligibility due to medical hardship.
“You want to be getting into football condition, just being around the team and getting a feel for everything,” Moeller said. “So having this happen is kind of a bummer. But at least it happened now and not during the season. And it’s not my chest or my brain, so that’s good.”
Moeller missed the entire 2009 season after suffering a major head injury when he was punched while on vacation in Florida that summer. Last year he was cleared to return to full contact, only to suffer a torn pectoral muscle in game five at Illinois that ended his season.
Senior running back Daniel Herron has to sit out the first five games because of the NCAA suspension he and teammates Mike Adams, DeVier Posey and Solomon Thomas are facing for receiving improper benefits from a tattoo parlor owner. Along with practicing and helping the younger running backs, Herron has been cultivating a substantial beard.
“Originally my idea was to cut it when the Nebraska game came and I get to return to playing,” Herron said yesterday. “But I don’t know now, a lot of people kind of like it. I might keep it a little longer.”

For the 10th year in a row, there was a motorcycle "Hog" rally starting today, so there was lots of activity. We selected a quieter spot for lunch a few blocks from the rally at Rod's Steakhouse. I was able to get a salad with awesome Blue Cheese dressing, a ribeye, and wedge fries for $9 - it was delish! This was a one-way road, and we parked past the entrance, and when we looked up we could not help but laugh at the sign, embiginate it to read it.
Phew! As you can see, today was a busy day, we had 150 miles to go, with the things to see, it is a challenge. So, taking a breath here before we continue on... After Williams, we passed through Ash Fork, and then started on an approximately 150 mile stretch of original Route 66 routing (not always over the original road, but always close).
Once we got into Kingman, we toured around, checked into our hotel, rearranged luggage (we only take in 3-4 days of clothes, with the bulk in the trunk), and they headed out for dinner. We went Italian tonight, and it was a pleasant change of pace (the Chianti was not bad either :o). The highlight of the day was the variety of terrain - mountain forest, desert plains, rocky outcroppings.
I leave you with this last observation, since we have been out west, following the train tracks, I am amazed at how many trains are carrying cargo into the heartland and beyond.

Yes, the Flagstaff area was just gorgeous, with all the pine trees. Prettiest area so far, in my opinion!
I am amazed and so pleased you are able to get as many photo's as you are doing. Love them all. Wow I love the cattle drive, the half-off special, the peaceful spur and I could almost smell the trees. One thing I love about the west, is being able to see an entire train from engine to caboose, you don't do that back east.
Thanks!!
The ice cream shop would have prolly had big fun at my expense! And I agree about the trains... all that commerce going past would have brought to mind Dagny Talbert and her struggles..!

Ticket #3048 (closed bug: fixed)
QUnit/testrunner.js fails when error message contains XML-interpreted characters
Description
When a test throws an exception and the exception message contains characters with an XML-meaning, the testrunner will fail with a SAXParseException.
For example, I've got a test which throws an exception whose message is like this:
The element type "input" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</input>"
which will in turn cause an error like:
test_core: Wrapped java.lang.RuntimeException: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The element type "wrap" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</wrap>". (file:/home/bruno/projects/kauri/trunk/modules/kauri-forms/kauri-forms-framework/../kauri-forms-jquery/src/main/kauri/js/testrunner.js#146)
The solution is either to escape any special characters in the message string, or to not interprete it as HTML.
In the attached patch, I take the latter approach.

These are artwork of the items as seen in the Pokémon Dream World., and Casteliacone, are variants of the Full Heal. The RageCandyBar, introduced in Generation II, is a variation of the Potion instead.
- In Pokémon Adventures, Blue is healed with a Parlyz Heal, the first time a status ailment healing item besides local specialties is used on a human.
- In the games, "Old Gateau" is pluralized in two different grammatically correct ways. When buying the Souvenir Set in Join Avenue, the description says "A set of two Old Gateaus.

Battle Frontier (Generation III)
The Battle Frontier (Japanese: バトルフロンティア Battle Frontier) is a special post-Pokémon League area in Pokémon Emerald that features several arenas where powerful Trainers can battle each other.
The Battle Frontier replaces the Battle Tower in its location south of Route 130, and likewise is only accessible by taking the S.S. Tidal from Lilycove City or Slateport City. Unlike the plain Battle Tower in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, as well, each of the facilities in the Battle Frontier has a leader, the Frontier Brain, who may be challenged after certain winning streaks have been made through their respective facilities.
In the anime, this Battle Frontier, rather than being on one of Hoenn's many small islands, is spread across the Kanto region, presumably so as to reflect on the then-recent releases of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen as well as Emerald. Much like the Gyms do not have a requirement that Ash beats anyone besides the Gym Leader, Ash is not required to compete in any matches besides those against the Frontier Brain.
In either canon, the Battle Frontier is owned and operated by Scott, who meets up with the player throughout the game in Emerald, and met up with Ash in The Scheme Team.
Pokémon
Items
Overview.
On winning through a set amount of battles in any given facility, Battle Points will be awarded, usually in small amounts, but gradually growing through each consecutive streak. Defeating the Frontier Brain of a given facility for the first time awards the silver Symbol of that facility, as well as 20BP, while the second defeat of the same Brain gives the Symbol a golden color and the player another 20:
Facilities
Battle Tower
Returning from Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the Battle Tower (Japanese: バトルタワー Battle Tower) is the most standard of the facilities. Like before, it features a standard 3-vs-3 single or 4-vs-4 Double Battle format, with straight runs of 7 Trainers that get progressively more powerful as the player goes on.
At the 35th and 70th battle, five and ten runs through, respectively, Salon Maiden Anabel, the Frontier Brain, appears. If she is defeated, she awards the Ability Symbol.
All multiplayer functions found in Ruby and Sapphire are retained, as well. For a detailed description of these, see Battle Tower (Hoenn). Through a glitch, players may exploit the Battle Tower in Emerald to clone their Pokémon.
In the anime
In the anime, the Battle Tower was the sixth of the facilities Ash challenged, in the episodes Talking a Good Game! and Second Time's the Charm!. After losing the first match, Ash redoubled his efforts and rechallenged Anabel, resulting in a win. This version of the Battle Tower is near Tohjo Falls.
For the Battle Tower in LaRousse City, see here.

Battle Palace
In the Battle Palace (Japanese: バトルパレス), Palace Maven Spenser challenges the player. If defeated, he awards the Spirits Symbol.
In the anime
The Battle Palace was the fifth facility to be challenged by Ash in the anime, where it was on Metallica Island, near the Seafoam Islands. It appeared in Cutting the Ties that Bind! and Ka Boom with a View!.

Battle Factory
The Battle Factory (Japanese: バトルファクトリー.
At the 21st and 42nd battle in a streak, three and six times through the Battle Factory, Factory Head Noland will challenge the player to a battle. Like all other Trainers in the facility, including the player, his Pokémon are completely random, and so cannot be known until he is encountered. If he is defeated, he awards the Knowledge Symbol.

Battle Pyramid
The Battle Pyramid (Japanese: バトルピラミッド Battle Pyramid) is a 7-layer pyramid. Each level is shrouded in darkness, and can only be lit up by defeating opponents on the level. Trainers cannot take any items into the pyramid, and items found within can only be used while inside, being stored in a special item bag that is handed out to those who challenge it.
If the player is victorious, the bag stores said items for the next challenge. However, upon defeat the bag's contents return to 1×
and 1×

Battle Dome
The Battle Dome (Japanese: バトルドーム Battle Dome) is a tournament between 16 Trainers.
Before each battle, the player can find out about their opponent, such as the Pokémon they use, their battle style, and how they train. Competitors can find out who was eliminated in each round by looking at the tournament bracket.
After the player has won five and ten championships, Dome Ace Tucker will challenge him or her. On his defeat, he awards the Tactics Symbol.
Seeding
The tournament bracket is organized as follows:
- Left Bracket: 1 vs 9, 13 vs 5, 8 vs 16, 12 vs 4
- Right Bracket: 3 vs 11, 15 vs 7, 6 vs 14, 10 vs 2
Seedings are determined by their ranking: the sum of the combined base stat totals of all Pokémon, plus 1/20 of the product of the number of different types represented by the Pokémon and the highest level among the Pokémon. If two Trainers tie in ranking, the higher internal Trainer number will win the tiebreaker; the player will always win the tiebreaker against any CPU Trainer, while Dome Ace Tucker will win any tiebreaker against other CPU Trainers. In the event of a tie battle, the higher seed advances and the lower seed is eliminated.
Battle Style
The battle style of a Trainer is solely determined by the effort values of all of the Trainer's Pokémon. A stat is considered to be emphasized if it makes up at least 30% of the team's EVs (taking Nature into account: for this calculation, EVs on a Pokémon with a beneficial Nature are worth 10% more, while EVs on a hindering Nature are worth 10% less), and neglected if there are no EVs in that stat among the entered Pokémon.
If there are any emphasized stats, they are shown (if there are three emphasized stats, only two are shown). Otherwise, if there are any neglected stats, they are shown (if there are more than two, only two are shown; the ones that are shown are further influenced by the number of entered Pokémon having a hindering Nature in the particular stat). Otherwise, the Trainer is said to "raise Pokémon in a well-balanced way."
CPU Battles
Note that the game does not simulate battles between two CPU Trainers. Instead, the outcome between two CPU Trainers is broken down as follows: each Trainer is scored based upon the sum of the following:
- The type affinity of damaging attacks: each attack dealing damage on the team is compared against each Pokémon on the opposing team. 4 points are awarded if the attack is normally effective, 12 if super-effective, and 20 if 4× super-effective. No points are awarded if the attack is resisted. 8 points are deducted if the attack is 4× resisted, and 16 points are deducted if the attack is ineffective. For the purposes of calculating this, Ground-type attacks are considered to be neutral against Pokémon with Levitate. Against Pokémon with Wonder Guard, type matchups that are not super-effective do not award nor deduct points.
- The sum of the base stats of all Pokémon, divided by 10
- The seeding of the Trainer, minus 1
- A random value from 0 to 31
The Trainer with the higher score advances; if this is a tie, then the higher-seeded Trainer advances. During tournaments in which he may be challenged by the player, Tucker always appears as the #2 seeded contestant, and will always win his battles against CPU opponents.
CPU Pokémon Selection
To determine the Pokémon sent out by a CPU Trainer against the player, each of the CPU Trainer's three Pokémon is given a score. There are two scoring methods, which are chosen at random: the offensive method and defensive method. Both methods compare the type affinity of the Pokémon's damaging attacks against each of the three Pokémon on the player's team. In the offensive method, 2 points are awarded if the attack is normally effective, 4 if super-effective, and 8 if 4× super-effective. In the defensive method, 2 points are awarded if the attack is resisted, 4 if 4× resisted, and 8 if ineffective. 2 points are deducted if super-effective, and 4 are deducted if 4× super-effective. No points are awarded or deducted in any other scenario. For the purposes of this calculation, type matchups that are not super-effective against Pokémon with Wonder Guard are ignored (no points are awarded or deducted), and Ground-type attacks are considered to be neutral against Pokémon with Levitate.
If all three Pokémon tie in one method, the other method is used. If all three Pokémon tie in the second method, then two Pokémon and the order they appear are chosen at random. Otherwise, the two highest-scoring Pokémon is chosen (if there is a tie for the second selection, the second selection of Pokémon is chosen at random). There is a 40% chance that the CPU Trainer will lead off with the higher-scoring Pokémon, and a 60% chance of leading off with the lower-scoring Pokémon.
In the anime
In the anime, Ash challenged the Battle Dome, which is located near Lavender Town, in Tactics Theatrics!!, as his third facility.
Gallery
Battle Arena
The Battle Arena (Japanese: バトルアリーナ Battle Arena) pits two Pokémon against one another for three rounds. If both Pokémon last all three rounds, they are rated on how they battled in three aspects, and the Pokémon with the higher score wins, and the losing Pokémon leaves battle. If they somehow tie, both Pokémon leave battle. A knockout results in an automatic win for the Pokémon that is still standing.
Pokémon are scored on their mind, skill, and body. This is much like the Fallarbor Town Battle Tent rules. The Pokémon with the better rating in each category scores two points, while a tie will award one point to each Pokémon.
- Mind judges Pokémon on their offensive style. One point is awarded if an attack that deals damage is chosen for use (except Counter, Mirror Coat, and Bide, which do not award points, and Fake Out, which deducts one point), and one point is deducted if Protect, Detect, or Endure was chosen. All other moves do not award points. The Pokémon with the higher number of points wins the two points in the overall judgment.
- Skill judges Pokémon on accuracy. One point is awarded if an attack lands successfully, while two points are deducted if it does not, unless it was caused by Protect, Detect, Endure, or Fake Out, in which no points are deducted. The Pokémon with the higher number of points wins the two points in the overall.
In the anime
In the anime, Ash challenged the Battle Arena, located near Saffron City, as his second facility, in Wheel of Frontier!. Before the match begins, a special machine is used to determine if the match is 1-vs-1, 2-vs-2, or 3-vs-3.
Gallery
Battle Pike
The Battle Pike (Japanese: バトルチューブ Battle Tube) is a long pike in the design of a Seviper. Inside of it are 21 rooms, in seven sets of three. The player may choose any of the three in a set to continue through, and in each of the three, any of the following eight events may occur:
- Single battle: The Trainer walks up to the player and battles.
- Double battle: Two Trainers walk up to the player and battle.
- Single battle and healing: 3 Pokémon per side; winner's Pokémon are completely healed.
- Wild Pokémon: wild Dusclops, Seviper, Milotic, Wobbuffet, Breloom, or Electrode appear.
- No event: An NPC stands in the room but does nothing.
- Status effect: A surprise attack will inflict a status on one or more of a player's Pokémon. The status includes Kirlia's burn, paralysis,.
In the anime
In the anime, the Battle Pike is located near Fuchsia City, and Ash challenged it as his fourth facility in Queen of the Serpentine!.

Hello Lovelies,
in the depths of winter, when the garden is mostly dormant and not a very tempting place to be I get a lot of pleasure from watching indoor bulbs, growing on my kitchen windowsill.
from a little shoot........
the green leaves grow at a rapid rate and soon a promising flower bud appears...........
21st Dec
On Christmas day my red tulips were the star attraction , but I still loved the anticipation of the wonderful red Amaryllis flowers to come......
3rd January
Last week was super busy , but one simple thing that made me smile when I got home after dark each day was checking on the emerging flowers.......
Monday 7th
Getting bigger, maybe tomorrow they will be open .........
Tuesday 8th
No, but I love the progress shots anyway :0)..........
Wednesday 9th
Oooooooh , getting closer.....
Thursday 10th
On Friday I had a day off so I carefully moved the wobbly,towering plant onto my mantle and got chance to enjoy the emerging flowers in the daylight........
I'ts huge
Ta-dah........
♥♥♥♥♥
Then all you have to do is plant the bulb,water it occasionally and enjoy watching it grow........there's no hurry :0)
Jacquie x
The bulb flowers again next year too - but much later so when your bought bulb has been and gone the saved bulb comes into flower :)
L.x.
Thank you for sharing with us the journey of beauty...
Goodness, I have never seen a red amaryllis before, I love it. Not keen on the pale washed out pink and lilac ones.
Aahhh beautiful, I have a real thing for these flowers, lovely lovely red absolutely stunning, love it .

What fun to photograph it's progress! And what thumping great blooms of beauty! :) Lovely! xx
really wonderful!!!! i love red amaryllis!!! great photographs!

Just loved.
Thank you for sharing.

So wonderful to see how you experience this! I'm on the same path with my amaryllis, it is starting to open up now and I can't wait to see the full blossoming flower :) Mine is the pale pink and I think I like the red better as well ;) And yours is HUGE, mine is much smaller, the leaves won't grow and the flower bulb is not even half the length of yours. But I do have 3 flower bulbs coming up! Enjoy your amaryllis!
Lovely - I forgot to get one this year. So cheap for the weeks of fun! Sue x
I remember the anticipation of these - my mum used to get one every year for Christmas! So pretty :)
Jones x
An amazing feat of nature - love the red too. Btw your Harold in the frost pics were wonderful. Claire at Just a little less xo
I don't always comment, but want you to know how much I enjoy your sunny blog. Heather
The amaryllis is beautiful! Very cheering! Cx
How pretty, I forced paperwhites this year. It is so nice to have fresh flowers in the dead of winter.
A beautiful amaryllis! I'm still waiting for mine to flower - I bought it as a kit in November thinking it might flower for Christmas, but it is still only 5 inches tall!
Angie x
I am being patient and waiting for mine to flower ... xx
Just gorgeous - a fab colour too :)
Absoloutely stunning and gorgeous, I love the deep vibrant colour.
luv
irene
xxxx
don't throw the bulb when ti finishes flowering. If you leave it somewhere until the leaves die back then cut them off and store it somewhere dry, you should be able to plant it again and it will flower next year. You could perhaps feed it a bit to encourage this.
I just bought on of these at Lidl. Here in Germany it cost me 5 Euros, so a little more expensive than yours. But I think it is still worth it. So mine is very very tiny now and I can't wait to see it blossom so beautifully as yours does.
Mine came withh a glass vase shaped like a hour glas. So only the roots are reaching the water and the buld itself stays dry. The instructions says you have to replace the water every time it changes its color.
We'll see.
oh, so beautiful!!!
I'm experimenting the same joy this winter with a hyacint! :)
And I have pink ciclamens like you!!!
Lovely. I have never tried to grow bulbs inside but I think we all need a little greenery and colour in the house at this time of year. I've been buying tete-a-tetes and narcissi and tulips like there's no tomorrow!
Gillian x
Hello! You made lovely photo-reportage of your really nice flower! :) J.
Gorgeous flower!
I am so annoyed I wanted to get a couple bulbs this Christmas time and forgot. Love your Amaryllis though. :)

Bravo! aren't they amazing, I will have to try one day. Heather x
Gorgeous! I love amaryllis. I haven't had one in a few years but I may have to start again this coming year. Enjoy your beautiful flowers!

My favorite part was an interview with former Ambassador Ryan Crocker. His in-depth assessments an on-the-ground experience of the current situation in Afghanistan made his comments a fresh relief from the typical news media reports about the area.”

“As a student pursuing a degree in both economics and Middle East studies, it is very rare for me to find opportunities on campus that successfully integrate the two subjects.

PH debuts as Asia’s new gamblers’ havenBy Michael Lim Ubac
Philippine Daily Inquirer
MANILA, Philippines—President Benigno Aquino III described in glowing terms the giant $1.2-billion Solaire Resort and Casino on Manila Bay that he opened on Saturday, kicking off the Philippines’ high-stakes bid to join the world’s elite gaming destinations of Macau and Las Vegas.
Solaire, controlled by billionaire port king Enrique Razon Jr., the country’s third richest man, is only the first of four huge gaming venues set to rise on reclaimed land as part of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.’s “Entertainment City” complex that officials hope will draw millions of Asian visitors.
Mr. Aquino led a high-powered VIP guest list that included the country’s economic, social and political elite, expatriates and Cabinet officials Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and Cabinet Secretary Rene Almendras.
“Today, it is indeed a pleasure to be in the company of those who continue to work with us to ensure that our tourism industry gets the recognition it deserves—to make certain that the basic truth that drives our global marketing pitch endures: that, indeed, it is more fun in the Philippines,” said Mr. Aquino, eliciting applause from an audience dressed for an evening gala rather than an afternoon outdoor event.
The President and Razon officially opened the integrated resort after a colorful ceremony featuring dancers pirouetting on ropes suspended from the ceiling.
Run by Las Vegas-based Global Gaming Asset Management and owned by Razon’s Bloomberry Resorts Corp., Solaire has 300 gaming tables and 1,200 slot machines on a floor the size of four football pitches. The building also has 500 hotel rooms and 2,000 parking slots.
Another wing is being built to add 300 all-suite hotel rooms, 30 to 40 high-end shops and a theater for traveling Broadway shows as well as local and foreign lounge acts.
The first phase that opened yesterday cost more than $700 million to build. Bloomberry expects to invest a total of $1.2 billion when the Solaire hotel-casino complex is completed.
Even as Solaire was opening its doors, Razon said the company already has its sights on putting up new casinos in other Asian countries.
“We are browsing around. Any chance we get, we will take it,” Razon said, but added that the company would have to make a name for itself first before venturing overseas.
Far from done
The President, who was himself well suited for the occasion, noted that during the past two years and eight months of his term, people around the world had looked at the Philippines and seen a country “vastly different from what it was just years before.”
“Not only do they see a people re-energized, or an economy brimming with optimism and new life, they have also begun to see in us a world-class tourist destination,” said Mr. Aquino.
He said he believed the country was now “beginning to realize the true potential of Philippine tourism, and I tell you, today we are far from done.”
He also thanked Razon for bringing back home 500 Filipino workers.
Bloomberry currently employs 4,600 workers. Of the total, 500 workers used to have jobs overseas but were recruited back to the country by Solaire.
The Philippines works
Mr. Aquino noted how other Asian destinations like Macau and Singapore were competing for bigger pieces of the very lucrative gaming industry pie.
“Your presence in the country is proof positive that while it is indeed more fun here, Filipinos can also strike a productive balance between work and play—that, above all else, the Philippines works.
“This is doubly true in the hospitality sector, since our people are naturally pleasant, and, as some say, seem to be born with smiles on their faces. These are universally compelling reasons for businesses to bet on our country, and I am grateful that you have done just that—to the tune of more than $1 billion for this project alone,” he said.
Aquino plugs Solaire big-time
Describing the mega-casino and entertainment resort in glowing terms, Mr. Aquino said Solaire was an entertainment hub that could be enjoyed by the whole family.
“Already, we can envision your guests during their stay—families swimming in the pool, couples relaxing in the spa, or simply sipping on a mango shake with the Manila Bay sunset in the background.
“Not to mention, a pleasant stay in Solaire can potentially expand the horizons of your guests. Soon enough, they may be more open to experiencing what the city around them has to offer—whether they want to take a bayside stroll, shop in the biggest mall in Asia, or even visit our newly refurbished National Museum,” he said.
The success of the Solaire project means attracting even more tourists to our country, he said.
“In fact, I am told that every tourist that visits our country directly results in the creation of one Filipino job. This means more work—more business, and consequently, more opportunities—for Filipinos.
Low-lying fruit
Mr. Aquino said that early in his term, his administration had identified tourism as “a low-lying fruit that had to be picked”.
“I am happy to report that, so far, we have been successful,” he said, noting that in two years, the country jumped 12 spots—from 94th to 82nd—in the World Economic Forum Travel and Tourism Index.
He said international tourist arrivals rose to a record 4.3 million in 2012, against 3.7 million in 2011.
He said that in 2011, the country saw 37.5 million domestic travelers, exceeding the government’s 2016 target by 2 million. The Department of Tourism has since upped its target for domestic tourism in 2016 to 56.1 million.
He said this means that by 2016, the country will need 37,000 more hotel rooms in tourism hotspots, and urged the industry to build more rooms.
With the positive review of the International Civil Aviation Organization of the country’s compliance with international safety standards, Mr. Aquino said he expected the country’s carriers to resume flights to and from Europe and the United States.
He also happily announced the signing into law of Republic Act No. 10378, which removes the 3-percent common carriers tax for all international air and shipping carriers on receipts and income derived from transporting passengers. With reports from AFP and and Paolo G. Montecillo

Headline ‘fun’ and a few thoughts on headline clarity gone wildBy Phillip Blanchard on Dec 19, 2012
People apparently like funny headlines. Facebook users post them right and left. Tumblr pages abound. I’m told they’re a regular feature on some late-night variety show. The mere mention of ”funny headlines” here will probably attract more hits than anything could, except kittens. To me, ”funny headlines” means more like “stupid headlines,” and I don’t think they’re funny [...]

Giant Chocolate Toffee Cookies
For this month's Secret Recipe Club, I was assigned the blog Bitchin Kitchin by Ellie in NJ. Ellie is a true foodie and her wonderful blog is full of savory and sweet selections, complete with lots of great photos that walk you through her recipes. If you get a chance, you must check out her cupcakes (so many tempting flavor combinations). It's been a very hectic month in the ButterYum household, so I chose a simple recipe to share with you today - Giant Chocolate Toffee Cookies. And yes, Giant is an accurate description as each cookie measure about 4-inches in diameter. These cookies are a bit unusual - the recipe calls for only 1/2 cup flour, but an entire pound of chocolate, 4 large eggs, and 1 3/4 cup brown sugar. They bake up big and heavy, but with a meringue-like quality to them - crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.
My Notes: The cookie batter is a snap to make, but it has to chill for 45 minutes before baking. I used a # 20 cookie scoop to portion out the dough, which yielded exactly 24 large cookies, I baked only 6 cookies per sheet pan, chilling the dough between batches. Much like dipping ice cream, rinsing the scoop with hot water every couple of dips allowed the hard, cold dough to release from the scoop easily. Plan to use several sheet pans as the cookies need to cool completely before being moved. Also, I see no reason why you couldn't make them smaller if you wanted to - simply adjust the baking time. These fantastic cookie are even better a day or two after they're baked.
Giant Chocolate Toffee Cookies
makes 24 cookies (using #20 scoop)
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
16 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 3/4 cups packed brown sugar
4 large eggs
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
7 ounces chocolate covered toffee bar bit, chopped (Skor, Heath, etc)
optional 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped (black walnuts would work particularly well here)
(No need to preheat the oven yet - the dough needs to chill before baking).
In a small bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder; set aside.
In a double boiler over medium heat, slowly melt the chocolate and butter together until smooth (my chocolate seized a bit before finally melting - probably caused by the moisture content of my butter. I just moved my double boiler off the heat and stirred the firm chocolate mass every few minutes until it relaxed into a melted puddle of chocolate goodness). Set melted chocolate mixture aside and allow to cool to lukewarm.
Beat sugar and eggs together for about 5 minutes until thick (I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment). Slowly add the melted chocolate and vanilla extract. Next add the flour mixture, followed by the chopped toffee candy and nuts. Cover bowl with plastic and chill for 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F. Drop cookie dough 2 1/2-inches apart onto sheet pans lined with parchment or silicone (6 cookies per sheet pan). Bake for 15 minutes; cool completely before removing. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.

Two Super Affiliates Come Clean About The Dirty Secrets That Made Them Over $324,823.49 This Year Alone From The Warrior Forum…
$324,823.49 Total Sales This Year Alone!
Are you ready to discover the easiest way to make money in affiliate marketing today?
This WSO will show you the same strategies we used to make a combined 324,823.49 in WSO sales this year.
Here’s the story:
Todd Gross – also known as the “weatherman of marketing” thanks to his 30 years as a weatherman – had one of the top 5 most successful WSOs of all time this year… 3,500 sales totaling $78K.
He also promotes WSOs regularly as an affiliate.
I ran 18 WSOs this year and promoted many other WSOs as an affiliate.
Even though I’m one of Clickbank’s top 100 affiliates, I’m finding it even easier to earn money as an affiliate right here on the Warrior Forum.
Anyway, here is why this is important for you:
We have created 2 ½ hours of videos where we give you the dirty secrets that will show you exactly how we earned 324,823.49 in the past 10 months from hanging around the Warrior Forum.
Here are just some of the secrets we reveal in this WSO:
* The exact type of WSOs to promote that will explode your sales.
* An incredible marketing secret from basketball legend Spud Webb that will give you the moves to outmaneuver the gurus.
* The 2 things to look for in a WSO before promoting it as an affiliate.
* Very simple ways to take advantage of your competition’s laziness and make more money for yourself.
* How to attract customers and partners to you like bees to honey without having to do any selling.
* The quickest and most profitable ways to build a targeted list of buyers.
* The #1 WORST mistake you can make with your list that will make subscribers never open your emails again. (I talk honestly about how this happened to me with a list of 5000 subscribers.)
And speaking of mistakes, you’ll see a whopper I made in a recent WSO that actually led to big profits… and how you can profit from it too.
In the videos you get a tour inside my and Todd’s Warrior Plus accounts and you’ll see the stats of our recent WSOs.
We hide nothing from you; these are real-life insights you’re getting from us.
* Why you should never imitate Frank Kern (or anyone else) when establishing yourself as an authority in your niche.
* Two things you must include in your emails that promote WSOs or else you’ll leave a lot of money on the table.
* A copy of an email that works like gangbusters when promoting any WSO (requires zero copywriting skills – start using it today for your own promotions).
* How to sell your list on a WSO… even before it goes live.
* What the WSO “sweet spot” price point is (consistently promote WSOs at this price point and your income will have fewer ups and downs).
*The average amount of time someone will stay on your list and how to convert them into buyers before they click on the unsubscribe link.
* Warning: How a high WSO conversion rate can actually kill your sales! (This tip alone is worth the price of this WSO.)
* How to run your own WSO with affiliates and add yet another revenue stream to your business.
* The people on your list that are the most responsive (plus how to target messages specifically to them so they become your customer).
* How to get your customers to enthusiastically refer new leads to you.
* How to stick out like a sore thumb in the super-competitive Internet marketing niche.
Please keep in mind you must grab your spot now, because this WSO will be closed on Nov 1st, and you will be locked out of this advanced training. Don’t put this off or you will miss this rare chance to get the *REAL SECRETS* to making money on the Warrior Forum.
This is intermediate-to-advanced affiliate marketing, so the methods we talk about in this WSO will require you to rethink what you know about affiliate marketing if you really want to succeed.
If the idea of making money upsets you, then please don’t buy this WSO.
I realize not all Warrior Forum members are ready for this next step. However, I highly encourage you to snap up this WSO anyway, so you have this info available when you are ready for it.
OK, now that we have that straightened out.
It’s seriously the best “no-sweat, no-brainer” way I know of to make life changing income.
Most of these bonuses require much of our time – we genuinely want to see you succeed and help you as others have helped me…
But that also means we have to spend time with you to ENSURE you’re getting results and not getting overwhelmed with information, and that you know how to carry out the instructions…
Look – Inside the course, we’ve laid out everything in a “look over our shoulder” kind of way so you know EXACTLY what to do.
But inevitably, you may run into some “roadblocks” that prevent you from moving forward.
We have both struggled with this for many years.
We took 1 step forward and then 2 steps back!
There was ALWAYS a little “something” that we couldn’t quite figure out…
That’s why we decided to add even MORE value to the course and help you succeed as long as you follow the instructions we give you (whether it’s personal training or a group session).
Here’s how this will take place…
You’ll get access to 1 LIVE "Question & Answer Webinar" To Help You Break Through The Blocks That Are Stopping You From Achieving Massive Online Success.
If you ever get lost, stuck, or don’t know what to do next – this is the perfect opportunity to get it handled.
Instead of sitting around surfing the internet – you’ll be lead by us personally on what parts of your business you should be focusing on to avoid costly mistakes and grow it as FAST as possible…
Todd was able to pin down David Eisner for a one-on-one 70 minute interview about affiliate marketing. To be honest, Todd had to twist my arm to convince me to even include this as a bonus because the content is so good it should have been a separate WSO.
We are still feeling queasy about doing this…but we are going to out right give you one of Charles’ highest converting money making email sequences on a silver platter. Plus you get his 100% blessing to use it in your own follow-up emails.
Now if that is not enough…you will also get a video walking you step by step through every email so you can clone it and use it for your personal profits.
To help you get up and running as fast as possible we have included a walk through guide to WSO PRO. This PDF gives you all the information you need to sign up and use Warrior Plus the right way.
Building your first list can be nearly impossible if you follow the normal way that almost everybody else preaches. In fact, that is probably the number one reason you haven’t been able to build your list so far. In this set of videos we are going to walk you through how to build your list the *RIGHT* way, so you can create dependable income.
The only thing I can tell you is that this will save you a lot of time and headache!
Here’s How It Works: We are ready to prove everything we claim. Download everything, and put it to work for you for the next 30 DAYS. If the product does not live up to your expectations, we will give back every penny to you. No hassles and we can part as friends. 100% Money-Back Guaranteed.
Why are we willing to make such an incredible guarantee?
Simple, we know this material forward and backward. We know it will work for you.
Look, we’ve put our hearts and souls into this, and frankly, we won’t feel this was a success unless you’ve made more money from affiliate marketing. And we mean that sincerely.
It Goes Up To $77 on November 2nd
We are going to launch this to warriors first because we need testimonials and feedback. After Nov 1st we are going to turn this into an automated webinar-based program that will most likely sell for $77. This WSO is only going to be open for 7 days at the discounted price.
Grab your copy today:
But don’t let the low price fool you. These videos are super-intense and have a ton of information.
Simply put, these videos aren’t for people who like to dabble but never take action.
We created this for people who are serious about affiliate marketing and adding to their income.
If that’s you, click on the buy button below:
Talk soon,
Charles Kirkland & Todd Gross
P.S. The WSO Super Affiliate course is only open for 7 days…if you want to learn the *REAL SECRETS* to making money with WSOs, then jump on this rare opportunity. We are thinking of turning this into a $77 webinar course. But fellow Warriors can get it for a limited time for the prelaunch price.
P.S.S. The strategies we talk about in the video fly in the face of 99.9% of what most marketers will tell you, which is why they are so effective.

Monday afternoon I opened my online Heisman Trophy ballot with no idea whose name I was going to put on top.
I wanted to type "Manti Te'o."
Instead I typed "Johnny Manziel."
It might have been the toughest Heisman decision I've had in my two decades as a voter. Either player would be a deserving winner. But you can only vote for one.
I wanted to vote for Te'o because I love everything about the guy: a senior with extraordinary leadership ability and charisma; a guy who has elevated his team to a new level of success; a defensive star in a sport that always favors the offensive stars; a young man with a heart-tugging backstory; and – this is important – a brilliant football player who has had a dominant season.
I would be quite happy to see him win Saturday night.
Yet in the end, after scrutinizing the statistics, I believe Manziel had the better season and deserved the vote. Barely.
The hardest part of this Heisman procedure was comparing a quarterback to a linebacker. There is no statistical commonality. It is very much apples for defense and oranges for offense..
[Related: Manti Te’o hauls in lots of awards, but the biggest awards still loom].
He handled that load spectacularly..
Outside of individual stats, team success is obviously a major Heisman component, too. And you cannot do better than undefeated and ranked No. 1. But in terms of elevating a team from one year to the next, Manziel has equaled Te'o: Notre Dame has gone from eight regular-season victories in 2011 to 12 in 2012; A&M has gone from six regular-season victories in 2011 to 10 in 2012. That's a plus-four for both.
There are some who have said A&M's improvement and Manziel's numbers are largely a product of playing in new coach Kevin Sumlin's pyrotechnic offense. There's no doubt that was a factor. But Te'o has had some help this season as well, playing behind a defensive front full of havoc-wreaking linemen who are ticketed for the NFL.
(The highlight of the BCS championship game between Alabama and Notre Dame figures to be the Crimson Tide's mauling offensive line and the Fighting Irish's indomitable defensive line. Trust me, NFL scouts will be riveted.)
The ability of the Irish line might also have contributed to Te'o's diminished tackle statistics this season. He went from 133 total tackles as a sophomore to 128 last year to 103 this year (with still one game to go). He didn't have a game with more than 12 total tackles this season, and did not have more than seven in any of the final four games.
[Photo gallery: Best players not to have won the Heisman]
A common knock on Manziel was his production against the elite defenses of Florida and LSU: He had no touchdown passes and three interceptions while running for one score and compiling "only" 536 total yards. But keep a couple things in mind:
• Almost every quarterback struggled against those two defenses. The Gators lead the nation in pass efficiency defense and the Tigers are ninth.
• The Florida game was Manziel's first as a collegian. With the postponement of the Aggies' opener against Louisiana Tech, that was his debut. Under those circumstances, 233 yards of total offense and a touchdown running isn't bad.
Bringing up those stats against elite defenses without crediting Manziel for what he did against Alabama – as some people have – is intellectually dishonest. Against the nation's No. 1 defense, on the road, Manziel sliced up then-undefeated No. 1 'Bama for 345 yards of offense and threw two touchdowns with no interceptions. And many of those plays were highlight-reel, Heisman-worthy stuff.
For all those reasons, I typed "Johnny Manziel” at the top of my Heisman Trophy ballot. Head overruled heart. I had to go with the best player, not the guy with the best story.

If it wants to have the best chance for success.<BR/><BR/><B>On the possible access constraint</B><BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>In order to minimize buildings taken out by the design, they put in very tight curves, which of course means operating at very low speed.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>Get the headway down to 2 minutes, and its 20 minutes arrival to arrival, each island can support 3 tph, and its 9tph total.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>Which is why it is not at all implausible that they designed an access system that is not adequate for the role that would be the strongest basis for the application for funding.BruceMcF M ...

Its a cut rate design to avoid dives and switching in the tunnel by allowing each tunnel track to act as an extended island platform track shared between the two platform tracks of the island.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>Consider the "fully semi-parallel" use of the access lines. Each line used as alternating bi-directional track, dedicated to its pair of platform. One passenger-platform shadows its neighbor on the same island, but each pair is fully independent.<BR/><BR/>The tunnel capacity used this would be 9 trains per hour if the tunnel is 1.5 miles, the average speed through the tunnel track is 10mph and the headways are 3 minutes.<BR/><BR/>Paired-bi-directional is a way of increasing capacity on through track, but does not work for accessing a terminal platform through a slow access line because the platforms will be idle for the time required to clear the pair from the platform and get a new pair in.<BR/><BR/>On the other hand, suppose that we start from the planned final allocation of platforms to services ... Caltrain to platform lines 1 and 6, HSR to platform lines 2 to 5, platform lines 2 to 5 more or less connected to a pair of tail tracks.<BR/><BR/>OK, so dedicate the two outside tracks to egress and access, respectively. With 3 minute headways, that is a maximum throughput of 20tph, adequate for 8 HSR services and 8 Caltrains service per hour, plus 4 slots for contingencies.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>So, in essence, a stack of two-way track goes around the curve from the 2nd street tunnel.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>As a bonus, once the pair of Caltrain access lines have dived down to form the stack of access/egress pairs, the track can ease the turn radius substantially, easing that train-box access speed limit.<BR/><BR/>As a partial financial compensation for the cost of the dive, after the second of the Caltrain access/egress pair rises and has been switched onto the egress track, the tunnel can narrow to two tracks at the start of the access tunnel.BruceMcF: if your terminal design is halfway decen..: I sincerely hope that nobody take HSR fr..?arcady, how does reducing the dwell time at the platf...Jim, how does reducing the dwell time at the platform get the trains through the tunnel quicker?<BR/><BR/ ...<BR/><BR/>....<BR/><BR/>Now, there are crossing switches, but once you start crossing, then a single train movement blocks four or six platforms instead of just two ... and for trains the length of a full length HSR, moving at very slow speed because of the curves, it takes <I>time</I> to get the whole train over a switch, and if you are crossing over from the outside track to the inside track, all three tunnel tracks will be blocked for a noticeable period of time.<BR/><BR/>So the "just run them at a faster speed through the tunnel" solution runs smack headlong into the tight curves in the design ... the only way that "shared bi-directional platform track with switches for contingencies" makes any <B><I>sense</I></B> is if the trains can clear the tunnel quickly, but the tight curves are the rail equivalent of speed bumps.<BR/><BR/ if they think atherton is a problem, wiat til...and if they think atherton is a problem, wiat till they try to jerk sf around. we don't play.jim's the bottom line, and the supes and the mayo...jim with the thru to tail tracks can 't the trai...jim arcady: "<i>BruceMcF: There aren't really three ...@ arcady: "<I>BruceMcF: There aren't really three routes to SF. There's basically one route, with branches.</I>"<BR/><BR/>Part of that is clearly a distinction without a difference ... Sacramento / SF is definitely a distinct service to SF / Anaheim.<BR/><BR/>The SF-SJ / LA / Anaheim | SD exploder "solution" is not a general purpose solution.<BR/><BR/>"<I>It would be easy enough to just split the train at LA, with the front going to San Diego and the back to Orange County, for example.</I>"<BR/><BR/.<BR/><BR/>And of course if the maximum combined patronage on two routes approaches one train per hour, so that two services per hour will be more than one full train, you still have two services, except with extra time penalties attached to whichever is the waiting half of the train.<BR/><BR/>@ Jim: "<I> jim said...<BR/>okay wait now - two platforms for hsr 12 departures per hour thats 6 departures per platform so thats and departure every 10 minutes, train arrives, people off, people on train departs. 5 minutes to offboard 5 minutes to board, not a problem. 400 people can board a train in 5 minutes. with no problem, In fact a 10 car train with 100 people per car ( 1000 passengers which will be rare on any one departure)</I>"<BR/><BR/>They are island platforms, with two platform tracks per island ... so that is 10 minutes to debark, 10 minutes to embark, and off. And at a more plausible 8tph when the system builds out, 15 minutes to debark, 15 minutes to embark.<BR/><BR/>So, no, its not the passenger access and egress that's the problem, its the <I>train</I> access and egress between the mainline and the platform tracks ... its a mess.

Has anyone here ever had much success with renting a spot in a bridal fair? I took a spot in one in my town this past spring then had a little one get sick. So my stand was there and my cards but I didnt get any real response from it. I did get a follow up email from the society that hosted it listing names of brides to call..I didnt get a response from it either. I know I wasnt there and didnt really give it a shot...just a decorated arch with a table under it with my cards,....no samples or anything but I am wondering if it would have been worthwhile if i had?Any input is appreciated!
<|endofexample|>
"...And underneath that, write 'We will miss you'. Got it?"
Oh yeah, they got.
Just found your blog, love it! It took me a second to realize what was going on with this cake and I too was laughing out loud!
I just realized that you started your blog on my birthday!!!
=D
so this may, we'll both be celebrating!
Love your blog Jen! I'm a dedicated reader!
I choked on part of my coffee and sprayed the rest all over my computer. Thanks...really!
As a former Wal-mart decorator Ive have been a first hand witness to some tragedies myself, luckily i was there to help fix them.... whoever took this order clearly has no common sense...
I love to go to other bakeries and see how bad the decorators are...I now have a camera and ill definitely have to send you guys some pictures
Oh Wow, I can't believe I didn't "Get it" before reading the post. at first thought that maybe suzanne had died... LOL
I wonder why everyone assumes the decorator misspelled underneath. That's probably exactly what it said on the order form.
Don't you just love non-English speaking bakers?
Best wishes Suzanne
We will miss you
("absolutly no quotestion marks parenthse's aposterphe's and double check spelling of Sue Zan underline 3 time's!!!")
Hahaha! and they didn't even spell it right! Double fail :)
Wow, that's neat. I'd even go so far as to say it's UNDER NEAT!
OMG, somebody just pointed me to your site for the first time, and this cake has me with tears rolling down my face I'm laughing so hard!!!!
Please oh please use this as the book cover! it's perfect! :)
and they misspelled underneath.
how sad.
I heard about it, but I didn't believe it.
Hi! My mother showed me your blog last week. I loooove it!
Hi, I know this is an old post, sorry... I just found you blog though, and it's HILARIOUS! So, I just wanted to tell you you have yet another fan :)
-Meggin
I have a feeling that the decorator has been told--several times--"Just write what I tell you!"
My boyfriend and I thought this cake was hilarious. For our 1 year anniversary a while back, he thought it would be funny to purposely have the card tucked into some flowers he bought me say "Happy Anniversary! / Under Neat that / Best Year Ever!"
but apparently the flower shop he went to was too competent (actually... not competent enough?) and left out the "Under Neat."
Love the blog!
at least the name was spelled right... right?
Years ago I ordered a cake for a family party celebrating my husband's, my father's and my niece's birthdays. It was to have said "Happy Birthday Tom, Buzz and Erica".
What I got was:
"Happy Birthday Tom Buzanerika"
When I went to pick it up I was so angry I told them to keep it, stormed out and bought an uninscribed cake at a different bakery. I wish I'd had the sense of humor to have taken it to the party - I would have had a picture to submit to this site!
omgsh! my choir teacher has this picture posted in the room. just a week ago we were trying to figure it out, just heard bout your site today and when i saw this pic i flipped out! either he was the one who ordered the cake or..just a fan of the site! definetley will ask him.
at first i thought it was 'Neat' also, because i didnt catch the real problem, since it was so obvious. but look closer, it appears that it may have originally bean 'Neat' but someone found 'the' mistake and fixed it by adding a little loop to make an h.
You can just imagine:
Customer: "O.K. so can you put best wishes Suzanne, and underneath that, we will miss you. Oh, and could you add sprinkles?"
Baker: "So that's best wishes Suzanne and underneath that, we will miss you. And sprinkles."
Customer: "Oh, and could you do it in pink?Thank you!"
Baker: "Yep, O.K., that will be ready for you to pick up tomorrow morning."
And this is what they get:
(On a cake)
Best Wishes Suzanne
and underneath that
We Will Miss You
Sprinkles
It in Pink thank you
Lol!
Doesn't it worry you that these bakers might actually DRIVE?!?!?!
Thanx, Scarlett Robyn
It made me hungry, what should I do now???
I think it's so delicious!!
'and under neat that' ....lol That quality humor.
I am a bakery manager. I can see this happenning if the decorator doesnt speak good english. I laughed hysterically when I saw it.
Love it! I had a similar cake wreck with a bridal shower cake. It should have said, "may your love be as timeless as the tides and as deep as the sea". Instead it read - "may your love be as timeless as the tide SAND ASS deep as the sea.". And this was from the "Cake Boss" in Hoboken, NJ! Thankfully we got it fixed before it was delivered to the bridal shower! Just wish I had a picture!
ah yes...verbal cake directions, i have found from experience, do not work well.
when my brother ed got married to his wife ruth...the bakery congratulated 'ruth & Ned' on the cake.
we freaked and corrected it...but couldn't resist telling every guest there about it.
That cake looks like something from the early seventies - but the literal misinterpretation is hilarious -
Great blog! I had to read all the posts, I couldn't stop...

Dustin G. sent in this lovely bit of irony purchased for the cast of a show called - you guessed it - "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." If you're feeling charitable, you can tell yourself the decorator misspelled "without" on purpose. If you're not, you can also nitpick the extra-wide spacing.
What's that? Taxes are due today? Grrr. Right, so, dudes: What is UP with that crazy double-spacing, eh?

...!?
It doesn't even make SENSE!
I can see that the guy who made this cake was too "wtf"ed at the cake request to spell 'without' right.
The logo for the show is awesome - why couldn't they have used that?!
<-- Played Rosemary in a 1998 community theatre production of How to Succeed...
Perhaps there with be a lucky switching of numbers in your taxes and you';; end up better off than this cake. lol
Just trying to fill up the cake, I guess. It is weird looking. And what a pity, it is otherwise entirely unremarkable.
WV: trastal - That's too much cake to put in the trastal - send it the way it is, they'll never notice.
All I can do is shake my head...
This cake is lame. Spelling mistakes aside, couldn't they have slapped a few $$dollar$$ signs on it or something?
What IS up with that spacing anyways ? ?
How to look like a fool without really trying.

Ya know, compared to some of your HORRIBLE wrecks, this one ain't too bad. At least the lettering is pretty...even if all of it's not quite right.
Cruel irony indeed...
I definitely thought that the "how" looked like Hour.... Which makes it even more wrecky.
How To Fail At Cake Decorating Without Really Trying.
Just gotta say...I'm playing Rosemary in this cast and I read this blog EVERY day...This is such a great way to start my Wednesday!
The cheese! The extra space is for the cheese slices that hand is about to add...
Maybe it was a test---you know, the one where they misspell words but because our minds somehow right the wrong, we can read it anyway.
WV: untsome: like reading word verification words and thinking they are real words, and can I get away with using them in Scrabble
Now it all makes sense!
Maybe it had been a long, been a long, been a long day for the wreckerator.
<--- got his nickname from the Venezuela-bound executive he played
I've seen the most typos in my Business classes, so this makes sense! =p
"How two Fial Speeling Wihtout Reelly Tring" is the working title of the play this wreckarator is working on.
I believe in you....
How do you spell succeed and business
correctly, then mess up without?
But I guess they weren't really trying!
WV-inwinci: This the cake inwinci messed up the spelling.
You gotta admit, the baselines are super straight. I think they put a ruler in between each line!
at least the writing is relatively straight, in spite of the double spacing...maybe they didn't want it to look cramped?
I'm with DangGina here, it's not that bad. Not that good, but... I make that error all the time, but when I type! Maybe s/he was trying out a new icing linotype machine.
It looks as though the "Wihtout" was first spelled "Wihout" the T, which was squeezed in later in the wrong place.
Wow, I was surprised to see which word was misspelled! I thought for sure it would be "succeed" or "business." Who spells "without" wrong?!
This is an example of how to make a cake without really trying.
How to fix spelling without really trying!
The spacing doesn't bother me nearly as much as they botched correction job.
Mind you, I'd still eat it...
WV: Vachness -- in such a vachness of space, any mistake can be fatal
I'm with hj. After succeed and business, without should be plain sailing. So, what's the story? I think our wreckerator obviously got too confident, too cocky. Or went out for a few quick halves at dinnertime.
Nice lettering, though. Someone's got a good hand.
Argh. Now I want cake, misspelled or otherwise!
wv: Warkin--I'll just warkin to the nearest bakery and get me some misspelled cake. Maybe they'll give me a discount? XD
Did this wreck come from Richmond, VA? I know people who are in this very play performing here right now.
I think your title sums it up quite nicely.
Word verfication: harstink. These cakes — they harstink.
It goes wihtout saying
I'm trying to figure out the point of the whole cake.
Do you succeed by eating cake??
If that's the case, then I'm golden!!!
Spelling "without" correctly would be trying way to hard, and they were wanting to convey how to succeed without really trying. you know, like apathetic cool, like yeah, we just happened upon this successful cake. isn't it great?
Or, "how to succeed in wrecking a cake without really trying".
That's triple-spacing, mind you.:o)
~Amy B.
Eh, thank goodness the rest of it isn't TOO horrible. I can't believe how many people CAN succeed in business without knowing how to spell though.
solution: cut the cake quickly at the error and no one will know.
I love how they navigated "succeed" and "business", then just murdered "without".
I think it damn well may be intentional. The whole cake seems half-assed. A TV show celebratory cake from a grocery store with unrelated red flowers?
I wonder if there is something we are supposed to read between the lines? LOL
The cake really isn't all that bad except for the spelling mistake. A simple error in word spacing!! But seriously...Don't people LOOK at their cakes when they pick them up and check for errors that can be easily fixed on the spot?? Oh yeah..they did..
Would it have been better if the post had started with "How to Fail in Spelling Wihtout Really Trying"
he just needs the time to think
it out
Maybe it's time for a new category: "Phoning It In".
It's like the decorator took one look at the order, sighed, and grumbled, "I hope they like rosettes, because that's what they're getting!!"
That's bad... you can tell they forgot the "T" and THEN put it in the wrong spot! tsk tsk tsk...
Why, Miss Jen, you seem to have read my mind (er...were you especially bored today?)!
Until now, I'd been wondering WHY there had been absolutely NO sort of reference, allusion or nod to the TAX SEASON via wreck! I really expected SOME little SOMEthing, like maybe a cake baked with a file inside for incarcerated tax evaders, or at the very least, a green and white cake.
It's like trying to ignore flying-insect season--sooner or later you're gonna get bit in the ass anyway. May as well have cake.
Okay, so there WAS no cake.
Never mind. =^u.u^=
She's obviously a writer - it's ingrained in us - double space, dobule space, duoble space. . .
:P
The spelling is stupid of the cake maker, but seriously, what's wrong with the spacing?!
I think that the Wreckerator was set on the wrong "Justify" setting and that is why the writing is spaced so weirdly. Hopefully the hit the re-set button before the next cake!
Ya gotta give the decorator credit for filling up every inch of cake space with something!
I was listening to an NPR blurb about SpongeBob this morning. Apparently it's his ten year anniversary and 18 million adults watch him per month!
no spell check for cakes!
high school near me did how to succeed 6 months ago. decorator also spelled without wihtout
I know, this one's old (currently prowling the archives). I've discovered an oddity I have the cake decorator may share: when handwriting something, I tend to duplicate my most common typos for the words in question, and "wihtout" is a very easy typo to make for "without".
Hey! That play has HARRY POTTER in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PS, I live in a city in Australia called Wangaratta, known by locals as Wang.
I made an elaborately sculpted dong cake once for a friend. I didn't put pics in my gallery for obvious reasons, but I used to list it and say people could email me for it. I got way, way, wayyyyyyy too many requests. Then I changed the listing to say I would not email pics anymore. I *still* got way, way, wayyyyyyyyyyyy too many requests. So I took the listings down.

Hi Peeps! Here's a new update on the developments for our Association of Call Center & BPO Agents of the Philippines Partylist. Two days ago, ACCAP spokespersons Kevin Carreon and Marge Caparas had a rare opportunity to meet Mar Roxas and the Liberal Party to discuss current issues affecting the lives of 500,000 BPO agents all over the Philippines. For those who do not know, the next most likely Vice-President of the Philippines has the closest affinity to the call center industry among our incumbent legislators. He has been tagged as the "father of the outsourcing industry" in past few years due to his participation in the growth of the industry in the past decade.
In the pictures below, Kevin had the unique opportunity to speak to the Liberal party officials present and present our call center agents cause and aspirations to the most likely ruling party for the next 4 years. In the pictures also present were Marge Caparas co-spokesperson of Kevin, Mar Roxas, Jim Paredes head of the Pinoy Power Coalition and Bam Aquino leader of the NoyPower movement.
Please join us in supporting all of our call center agents and BPO employees cause to uplift each other lives through our own Partylist in Congress! Support ACCAP through Facebook and spread the word that we have our own Partylist next elections!.

The Fourth Rough and Tumble Week of Being a Vegan
This week I went back to many of my old habits and yet found that I have continued to implement some of my new discoveries from the vegan diet. I avoided meat and eggs for the most part, but satisfied my sushi and salmon cravings. I had yogurt in my granola and ate slices of cheese with wine for the first time in months. I savored every bite and had a whole new appreciation for food without attachment. Iâ€™m not addicted to food and it is not on the forefront of my mind for the first time in a long time.
Iâ€™m on a quest to experiment with cooking, finding new ways to cook vegetables and whole grains. I made a new curry lentil dish and Thai green curry. I brought the crock-pot out of the cabinet so that I could cook in the summer without using the oven.
This is my path of self-discovery; I am never going to stop experimenting with new foods and new ways to eat. Like taking any path in life, sometimes you come across a bright green patch of grass that you want to lie down and sun bathe in, just to relax and enjoy the view. Meditate for a while on what you have seen so far and what it all means.
It was this week that I discovered that the actual definition of a vegan is: â€œVe.â€
When I look at this definition, I see that I was not taking on the actual vegan diet. I ate sugar and drank wine. I never checked to see if I was eating gelatin. Some vegans even take the lifestyle so far as to refrain from using any animal products, such as wearing wool, leather or fur. This is something I did not even consider!
My point is that some vegans do not just eat this way to look and feel healthy or even to prove a point that they can survive without processed food. Most do it as a contribution to the planet and out of their awareness and consciousness of the cruelty of modern animal agriculture. We destroy thousands and thousands of acres of rainforest to feed the cattle that we eat and milk. Animals are packed into unlivable, small spaces in factory farms, pumped up with antibiotics and drugs to stay alive. We never think of the suffering and misery that pigs go through, an animal as intelligent as a dog, yet we give Christmas presents to our pet dogs while eating ham for Christmas dinner.
It is also a spiritual experience of feeling more connected with other living things on the planet. I was so concerned with my cravings for sugar and fitting in, forgetting to meditate and feel this connection. Only once did I feel how powerful my body was during martial arts practice and I had completely dismissed my dadâ€™s compliment that I had impressive will-power. There was a mind-body connection that I was not focusing on. I was doing the diet on a surface level, not paying attention to the higher level consciousness that is part of the true vegan lifestyle.
All is well. Perhaps there was a reason I stopped early. It could have been so that I could have the fourth week to meditate on my experience. Perhaps it was because I wasnâ€™t in touch with the higher purpose of this lifestyle.
Does this change my point of view on middle of the road? No, but it gives me a new sense of awareness for me to practice. It allows me to continue cooking vegan at home, but not beating myself up over having sushi or chicken with friends at a special dinner. And most importantly, it helps me have a new appreciation for people who are committed to making this world a cleaner, healthier, and more conscious place.

The arts, specifically the music and film industries, have perhaps been the most profoundly impacted of all industry by the digital revolution. Canadian superstar Keanu Reeves felt passionately about exploring the impact that digital had on the movie business and so he engaged several of his fellow filmmaker to create the impressive documentary SIDE BY SIDE, which has graced film festival screens around the world.
From the film’s website: .”
Justin Szlasa co-produced the critically-acclaimed feature documentary with Keanu Reeves. SIDE BY SIDE chronicles the way digital technology has revolutionized how movies are made through interviews with industry leaders like George Lucas, James Cameron, Lars Von Trier, Walter Murch and David Lynch.

The way we transact intellectual property rights and manage contracts that has developed over many decades doesn’t meet the emerging needs of the digital content community. On the one hand we have state of the art digital technologies in multimillion-dollar production and broadcast management suites creating a huge volume and variety of content. On the other, we have a slow, methodical, labour intensive and document-oriented process.
Rights management could interface more effectively with a rapidly evolving and complex technology ecosystem to automate many of the downstream processes. How do we make the rights licensing process faster and more efficient and drive down transaction costs and complexity?

You’ve read about their stories on Mashable, TechCrunch, BusinessWeek… these young entrepreneurs have enjoyed tremendous success with their disruptive technologies – garnering up to millions of dollars in funding using traditional and non-traditional methods, and, in one case, getting acquired by Google. These dynamic innovators have more than their success in common – they are all graduates of the Y Combinator accelerator program, one of the most competitive programs in North America, if not the world. The other tie that binds them together is that they returned to Canada to grow their businesses, when many other Canucks did not venture back North after their stint in the Valley. Why did they return? What is it about the Canadian marketplace and the true north worker ethic that keeps these companies here? In this sure-to-be lively discussion, we’ll discuss the realities – warts and all – of successfully applying for and subsequently completing a Y Combinator stint, as well as what competitive advantages Canada has for starting and growing successful long-term technology ventures like these ones.
What exactly are the problems with rights management? Who is impacted? What are the costs to the organization?
In our second session on rights management, we’ll walk through scenarios in the life of digital content. In each, we’ll outline the stages, the players, the systems and the artifacts along with challenges in framing, transferring and managing associated rights. We will highlight the ambiguous terminology and concepts that bog the process down in phone calls, negotiations, conversations and clarifications. We will explore the opportunities for clarity, standardization and disambiguation in agreements
As we identify and describe these challenges, solutions will begin to emerge. You will understand the issues in rights management for both the industry and your organization and see how standardization drives out costs.

Lights, Camera, Economic Action: Building Human Capital to Fuel Screen-based Industry Growth
If innovation is the driving force of the digital economy, talent is its currency. In its 25th year, the Canadian Film Centre (CFC) continues to play a critical role in the development of Canada’s top screen-based industry talent. What’s more, as found in a 2012 Nordicity report, the CFC’s alumni are creating new companies, products and content which generate measurable growth and economic activity in the sector. But how can Canada maintain and grow its ability to nurture and retain top screen-based industry talent and how can we anticipate future skills, talent and performance needs of the sector?
Join CFC representatives, alumni and Nordicity for a discussion on the role of the CFC in the ecology of the screen based sector in Canada, highlights of its economic impacts and key performance indicators as well as a dynamic discussion on the role of the CFC and what the screen-industry needs in order to keep producing (and retaining) top talent.
Discussion threads may include:
- What is the vision of Canada’s screen-based sector? What is the strategy? How well are we doing?
- What kind of talent is propelling screen-based industry today in Canada to meet that vision?
- What is the impact on the economy that flows from the CFC graduates?
- What broadcasters, entertainment companies, and governments now see in the CFC?

In our third session on rights management, we’ll explore the technology ecosystem and how the components of the production and broadcast management systems address rights requirements. From simple text boxes to highly configurable rights administration systems, each environment has mechanisms for capturing and acting on rights. The key to all of this is metadata – the information about assets and the embodiment of that information in ways that technology can interpret and act on. In definitions and examples that everyone can understand, you’ll learn the crucial central role that metadata plays in the rights world.

Description: There is an identity ecosystem emerging in Canada that is unique in the world. It is a multi-enterprise service that is focused on making more meaningful services available online while at the same time making it easier for users to enroll, access and control information shared by these services. Things like easy access to online government services, opening a bank account on the internet, proving your identity for new services online, registering your child at school or participating in an education portal are becoming possible.
The service model for the Internet is moving from app-centric to user-centric. The current password model of authentication needs to evolve. Every web service needs to make a choice between making their credentials stronger by adding multifactor authentication (BYOD) or partnering to get authentication from a trusted provider (BYOC).
What are the motivators for change? What does this mean for users and web services? What is the economic model? How to improve the security and privacy model for users? What is happening now and what is on the horizon?
In this final session, we’ll apply best practices for deriving, defining and agreeing upon terms that could constitute standard rights management constructs. Attendees will be grouped and given assignments and instructions to create a rights management framework to meet the requirements of a typical transaction. We’ll put the exercises into a larger framework for attendees to see how rights management metadata, controlled vocabularies and ontologies are systematically derived and validated. The output of this working session will assist attendees in understanding and refining approaches to real world problems in their organizations. In a hands-on interactive workshop, you’ll learn about the following topics:
- Real world scenario and use case review
- Steps to the taxonomy development process
- Interactive exercises developing terms
- Validation approaches
- Next steps in the industry initiative and formation of the rights working group

Managing employees during tough times
As a small business owner, you will be faced with difficult choices during turbulent times like an economic downturn or a decrease in demand for your product or service. In order to stay competitive, you must streamline operations and offer creative responses to external threats. It is critical to encourage innovation and make the kinds of changes that are necessary to ensure that your business succeeds today and in the future.
When times are tough, business owners often resort to layoffs as a cost-saving measure. However, laying off employees can damage your business and impair its ability to succeed in the long term. Layoffs incur direct costs, including severance pay, administration fees and legal fees, which immediately affect your business' bottom line. There are also less tangible costs like the skills, knowledge and experience that are lost when an employee is let go.
In the face of layoffs, employees often experience lower morale and productivity, higher levels of absenteeism and job-related stress, and a loss of faith in the business. Your best employees may start looking for other opportunities. And, when business does improve, the costs of finding and training new employees are very high.
In the current economic climate, opportunities do exist, but small business owners must have clear strategies. Cutting back may get your business through the short-term crisis, but will not position you to be a leader in the future.
Innovative cost cutting and restructuring measures can help you reposition your business and define how business will be conducted in the future, without the need to let valuable employees go.
- Work-Sharing
If business is slow, you can offer your core workers a temporarily-reduced work week instead of laying them off.
Think long term
- Where possible, avoid layoffs. Recruiting new employees when your business rebounds can be expensive, and can put your reputation as an employer at risk.
- Reduce employee costs through work reorganization. Multi-tasking and learning new skills allow your staff to support your organization's needs now and in the future.
Use recognition and rewards
Rewarding employees can be a challenge in times of fiscal restraint. Here are some smart ways to recognize employees, while keeping costs low.
- Acknowledge employee contributions — employees want to feel that their efforts are recognized and appreciated.
- Use staff meetings as a forum to recognize outstanding achievements.
- Link incentives to the overall goals and objectives of your business.
- Offer low-cost, innovative perks, such as giving employees an afternoon off or access to a coveted parking spot.
- Make recognition personal — allow employees to choose their rewards.
Maintain a positive work environment
- Ensure that employees have fulfilling work that is challenging and interesting.
- Give employees continuous feedback and ensure that they understand their roles, the impact of their work on customers, and how they bring value to your organization.
- Offer employees flexible scheduling to help them balance their work and personal lives.
- Offer job-sharing and reduced work weeks. These alternatives to layoffs can help your firm retain existing jobs and return employees to full-time work when the recession is over.
- Have a strategy to deal with workplace stress and conflict.
- Set a clear sense of direction and leadership. Management should set a positive example for employees to follow.
Although avoiding layoffs during hard times can be a challenge, the benefits to your business in the long term are significant.
- Wage subsidies
Are high wage expectations making you reluctant to put up that Help Wanted sign? A wage subsidy program can put the perfect employee within your reach.

Looks like I bought in a little early at $20.33.
What's the issue here? Stock getting smacked with volatility today.
High $20.40
Low $20.07
Looks like the stock will bounce around from $20-$22 until the end of time. Not bad, but not good.
I placed a buy for 500 shares at $20.07 15 minutes ago.
It has bounced back from 20.08 to 20.07 6 times.
My order has not been filled.
A lot of buyers at $20.07.
I might have to settle for $20.08
According to some analysts I've heard, someone or entity is dumping a massive amount of shares. Could be they just have somewhere else where they want to employ their capital.
My order got filled. 500 at 20.07.
Then the stock dropped to $20.00.
I was kind of expecting $20.15 by the end of the day.
Oh, well. It happens.
Will hold it until I can sell at a profit.Will hold it until I can sell at a profit.
I still am having a hard time understanding. What's the cause for the drop?
I understand markets are generally down today, but I thought low interest rates were good for utility companies that have lots of debt?
So, with the low rates down to about 2014 in the US now, shouldn't the utility companies be doing better than they are?
I understand TA is a Canadian company, but still....?
I am not worried about my position, but if anyone has ideas or knowledge to share, they would be appreciated.
I haven't followed TA in a while and I don't see any apparent news release.
It is possible that some news might be coming later today or tomorrow.
Maybe another lawsuit for price fixing.
^ you mean like information not available to the public?
Yes, either that, or some major fund/institution is getting out.
But usually in the latter case, they spread it over several days.
Utilities seem to have a bond like correlation with the equity markets.

Manila, Philippines, November 30, 2010 – Detained community health workers collectively known as the Morong 43 are in high spirits even as they mark 10 months in jail, lawyers from the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) said yesterday in a statement.
“Hindi kami pinaghihinaan ng loob dahil alam namin na nasa likod namin kayo,” Eulogio Castillo, one of the detained, told lawyers who visited on Sunday, November 28, 2010.
Castillo, who considers the group as political prisoners, said they also rely on the larger social movement to secure their release. “We know that [the outcome of] our case holds implications for other political prisoners across the country,” he said in the vernacular. He also thanked the domestic and foreign groups and personalities taking up the cause of their release.
The men and women separately entertained the lawyers with songs of hope. The women also taught the lawyers their signature four claps, three stomps and chant “Free the 43”.
The Morong 43 all support the rally of lawyers and doctors set on Thursday, December 2, 2010. The legal and medical communities plan to march from Espana to Mendiola at noon, to ask the executive to drop charges against the Morong 43, on account of the illegality of their arrest and the subsequent search.
“Those of us who are concerned that fundamental rights embodied in laws whose very purpose is to protect citizens from possible abuses by the state are disregarded in such a brazen manner, must take a stand,” said NUPL secretary-general and counsel Edre Olalia.
The Morong 43 were arrested in February this year, while undergoing a health training in Morong, Rizal. A joint police-military operation, using a defective search warrant, swooped down upon the group early in the morning. The warrant did not specify the particular place to be searched.
The search allegedly yielded guns and ammunition, so the 43 were then blindfolded, handcuffed and brought to an undisclosed place where they were continuously interrogated day and night, denied their right to counsel and tortured physically and psychologically.
Charges of illegal possession of firearms and explosives were filed against the 43 health workers five days after their arrest. The law specifies a 36-hour deadline for the filing of charges against anyone arrested without a warrant.
NUPL lawyers visited the Morong 43 after its national legal consultation on extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and other human rights cases. NUPL and the Public Interest Law Center (PILC) represent the health workers in the criminal case filed at the Morong Regional Trial Court and Metropolitan Trial Court and in the petitions they have filed in the Commission of Human Rights, Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, administration ally and House Deputy Speaker Rep. Lorenzo “Erin” Tanada III reiterated his appeal to release the Morong 43.
“I think that amnesty is not what they need as they are not guilty of anything. What they need is nothing but just plain and simple respect for their basic human rights ,” Tañada emphasized in a separate statement.

HockeyDB.com quick reference :: CapGeek.com Contract History
What was the calendar year on June 30 preceding the first season of his first NHL contract?
Filling out this field accurately is the most critical step in the waiver calculation. If this is inputted incorrectly, the result will be calculated incorrectly.
This field should not be confused with the year the contract was signed. For example, Justin Abdelkader signed his first NHL contract on April 4, 2008, with 2007-08 as the first season of that contract. The calendar year on June 30 preceding the 2007-08 season is 2007, so 2007 would be selected here. Conversely, Colton Gillies signed his first contract on March 31, 2008, with 2008-09 as the first season. The calendar year on June 30 preceding the 2008-09 season is 2008, so 2008 would be selected here.
Contracts signed between March 1 and the end of a league year are most problematic for filling out this field because the first season of the contract can either be the current season or the following season.
In the event of a contract slide, years that have slid count as the first season of the contract. For example, Thomas Hickey signed his first NHL contract on July 10, 2007, with 2007-08 to be its first season. But his contract slid twice and now runs from 2009-10 to 2011-12. Nonetheless, 2007-08 is counted as his first season for waiver purposes, and the calendar year on June 30 preceding the 2007-08 season is 2007, so 2007 would be selected here.
In roughly 80 percent of the cases, this is an easy field to fill out, and the year often ends up aligning with the year the contract was actually signed. If you aren't certain about this field for a specific player, email admin@capgeek.com.

Sunday Funday
Because there is no practice, there is very little to report today. Mike Green has returned to Calgary to be with his family, as his grandmother passed away on Friday night. As such, there is no word about Green's availability for Tuesday's game, although I would consider him a long shot to suit up based on his previous condition. Goaltender Todd Ford, who backed up Michal Neuvirth last night, has been returned to Hershey of the American Hockey League for the Bears' game today. Ford had to be recalled to the Capitals on an emergency basis yesterday after Semyon Varlamov left the morning skate after about five minutes with an undisclosed (read: groin) injury. Again, since there is no practice today, we have no way of knowing how bad Varly's injury is, but I do not think that he will be rushed back. It should also be noted that the reason Braden Holtby was not recalled is because he is suffering from an injury of his own and is week-to-week.
Tomorrow is sure to be a very busy (and nerve-racking) day for Caps fans, as the NHL trade deadline passes at 3 P.M. EST. Will the Capitals make a big deal? Will Alexander Semin or a goalie be on their way out? Follow me on Twitter (@HarryHawkings) and check the blog often to find out.
That's all for today. Check back tomorrow, and enjoy your Sunday.

Not much here. Just doing a little bit of riding. Getting ready for the big day. That would be this Thursday. Going under the knife. Hernia's getting the best of me so I will let the Doc get the best of Mr. H. Should be back on the bike in one week. Can't wait.
Picked up a few toys to play with during my recovery. Should have them built up in a week or two. Might make a fixie road bike and a single speed monster cross. Should be fun.
I should be posting a bit more often but something always seems to steer me away from the computer lately. Seems to be my little lady hogging the computer most of the time. She has discovered craigslist.org and I just can't seem to get her off the junk. Oh well, whatever makes her happy.

Rob - Is the Centurion going to be your new road machine? I' still riding an old 6 speed 600 bike for roller workouts - good old bike.
What does it mean - comment has been deleted?
Good luck with your fight with Mr H.

It was going to be my road bike but it is a tad small. Mainly too low of head tube. Weird thing.
The comment was a spammer and had two links to viruses. It almost got me when I was trying to visit that persons blog. Quick fingers on my part save me $100 in computer repairs.
Capt. That spammer hit a few other bloggers lately too. I almost fell for it as well.
Take it easy and heal well.
I'll be praying for a spedy recovery.

As the temperature slowly but steadily begins it’s descend, we can start contemplating great jackets to wear. Three simple yet fabulous choices you can never fail with: a crisp white blazer, a black edgy version, or why not go the whole nine yards with a long silver coat. Love the entire outfit on the bottom picture by the way! Straight hair, plum lips and smokey eyes. And of course that glittering coat.

There are always exceptions to this, such as meeting a favourite person or doing something interesting or both. This is one of those exceptions.
Like Ottawa, Toronto was very food focussed. Incredibly food focussed. So food focussed I have no idea if I did anything (apart from look for parking) that wasn't food focussed. I think I spent a good six or seven hours eating, drinking and perusing foodish pursuits. There's little wonder why my clothes are just that much snugger.
You know you're in for a good meal when all you have to say is "Yeah, I'm meeting a friend at an Italian restaurant for lunch. Can't remember what it's called, but it's at Richmond and Victoria." and the response is gleeful "Ooh! Osteria Ciceri e Tria!" you know it's going to be good.
We shared the daily antipasti--a sampler tray, if you will. They were my word, they were good. I can remember all but one, but what I do recall--arincini di riso studded with cuttlefish, meatball in marinara sauce, lamb stew with crostini, fig with ham--was fabulous. For her main, my friend had the gnocchi with seafood; I had tagliatelle with duck ragu. We tried two desserts--a hazelnut tarte and a little cake (again, my memory fails).
If you read Jennifer of The Domestic Goddess, you know that we shared a fabulous iced coffee that afternoon. She wrote getting together was like meeting an old friend. It was.
Jennifer and I have been emailing each other, off and on, for years--(this month marks my fourth year foodblogging on Cardamom Addict; Jenn's been The Domestic Goddess for almost six years). We've cohosted events and sent questions and comments back and forth to one another, but in all this time we've never managed to meet.
There was an immediate ease and familiarity--the type that's normally reserved for long lost friends who haven't seen each other in years. We sat at a patio and chatted about family and friends and Ottawa. We talked about blogging and characters who've come and gone in those years. We talked about our current real life adventures. Every once in a while pausing (or trying to out-volume) the Blue Angels as they zoomed over head, rehearsing for the Air show.
Throughout, we were the targets of unwanted attention. No, not the wayward Bay Street crowd. A bee. Probably a relative of the one that harassed Yal and I. Cheeky monkey tried to steal some of my coffee too! That's just what I need...a fixated bee on a coffee buzz.
I could have spent all afternoon chatting with her, but alas, she wasn't on holidays. We parted ways and I found my self on the TTC at possibly one of the two most dangerous-to-me stores in Toronto. The Cookbook Store is one of my measured Meccas. Yes. A store devoted to cookbooks. The usual suspects from Food TV are there, but unlike other bookstores, they don't dominate the shelves. Here is where I find good food writers. Here is where I find interesting titles. Titles appear here, in their original format, before they appear in big-box bookstores, rewritten for the American audience. I left with a copy of Piri Piri Starfish, a book from which I desperately want to cook each and every single recipe.
My restraint at the Cookbook Store was easily voided as I peeked in at a neighbouring kitchenware shop. That peek ended up with me buying a terra cotta garlic keeper and a cast iron corncob printed cornbread tin. I'd seen them in magazines and recipe books and just couldn't resisit.
It was inaugurated the next day with my variant of my favourite cornbread recipe. Using a combination of maple syrup and brown sugar, the bread has a sweet-smoky flavour. I'm sure the niblet pattern discernable in the cute little cobs only helps to make the cornbread even more tasty.
125g ap flour
1tsp salt
1Tbsp baking powder
1/4tsp baking soda
120g cornmeal
50g brown sugar
1 egg2Tbsp
vegetable oil
225ml milk
125ml maple syrup
Preheat oven to 200C/400F.
Seive together flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Stir in cornmeal.
Beat together the egg, sugar and oil until smooth. Mix in the maple syrup and milk. Pour into dry ingredients and mix well.
Pour into prepared 22cm (9") cake pan or muffin tin. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until an inserted skewer comes out clean.
cheers!
jasmine
Oh, and the other dangerous-to-me shop? Well, if I mentioned it by name, I'm sure the percentage of solicitous emails I receive will increase. That's a lot coming from the gal who's also the Sensual Gourmet...But really, I highly recommend them, especially if you're well beyond what regular department stores stock.

That must have been so nice to finally meet her. Toronto is such a great city for a foodie.
So sorry I missed you on this trip but I will definitely take a raincheck! Glad you had such a fabulous time.
What a glorious day you had. Many thanks for sharing the foodie photos.
The cornbread looks so sweet when made in a corn shaped pan - that just must help with the flavour too.... lol and sending many huggles,
Michelle and Zebbycat, xxx
I could have spent all afternoon chatting with you too. Let's plan on that next time. With enough advance notice I can take time off...doesn't happen often though so let's book it soon!!

Position applied: Mother/Family Caregiver
Being a mother is not easy.
It is the most difficult and challenging job I have experienced.
21 years before, I didn’t know how it was to be a mother.
Although I have a loving mother, I am more focused on what I am and want as a child.
It took years and years to finally figure out what does a real mother is.
It is easy to describe what a real mother is based on what you see but that description would definitely change when you are in that position.
Job description:
Mother/family caregivers need to be a master in Homeroom and Economics to be able to cook and manage household chores well.
Be a master in Psychology to be able to understand your kids and husbands behavior and be able to deal with them in a positive way.
Be a master in Business Management/ Accounting to be able to manage the finance of the family.
Be a master in Social Work to be able to serve your family, relatives, friends and community and teach other people to be independent and to be of service to others as well.
Be a master of the virtue of Godliness to be able to serve God, to do what is right and just to your fellowmen.
And most of all be a master in Education, be educated doesn’t mean you need to go to school.
Education entails us to feed our mind and soul with the right information through books, visual aids, audio visuals, attending seminars, forums and the like.
Be a catalyst and instrument of change.
If we hope for a change in our society, let’s start with in ourselves.
Personality development as mother is very important, because as a mother and caregiver we need to have the right attitude, integrity and commitment in order to create the change that we aspire for.
From us to our family, raise kids to have the right attitude, faith in God, be a good leader and good citizens.
Then finally there would be a better society if we do the right thing and share it with others in our community.
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!

LOS ANGELES — Is this the year Woody Allen warms up to the Oscars?
The Academy certainly showed its love for the director and his “Midnight in Paris” on Tuesday, nominating him for best director (for the seventh time in his career) and his film for best picture. It also picked up nods for best screenplay and best art direction, a particularly tricky category for smaller-budget films to crack.
Will Mr. Allen, who has routinely skipped the ceremony over the years, attend? “Who knows?” said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which released “Midnight in Paris.” “I do know he’s really happy this morning.” He added, “For Woody to be 76 and working at the peak of his form is simply terrific. There’s a lot of love for the movie and him.”
With “Midnight in Paris,” which cost about $17 million to make, Mr. Allen is experiencing some of the biggest ticket sales of his career. The movie is still playing specialty theaters after nine months – astounding staying power – and Mr. Barker said he expected North American ticket revenue to pass $60 million. It’s currently at about $56 million.
It was a good morning all around for Mr. Barker and his co-president, Tom Bernard. Among their other films receiving nominations was “A Separation,” an Iranian family drama. It received two nods, including one for original screenplay, an extremely hard category for a foreign film to elbow into. “It’s proof positive that the Academy does what it promises, and that is honor the best,” Mr. Barker said.

The court viewed the interest of the disability recipient in uninterrupted benefits as indistinguishable from that of the welfare recipient in Goldberg. It further noted that decisions subsequent to Goldberg demonstrated that the due process requirement of pretermination hearings is not limited to situations involving the deprivation of vital necessities. See Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 88 -89 (1972); Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535,..,. 319, 329]

Saccharomyces boulardii fungemia caused by treatment with a probioticum
- Correspondence to Dr Britta Tarp, brittarp{at}rm.dk
Summary
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as baker’s yeast, is normally considered a non-pathogenic yeast. A genetically very similar subtype, S boulardii, is used in a probioticum (Sacchaflor) to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea. The authors present. Treatment with Sacchaflor was immediately discontinued and the patient was successfully treated with amphotericin B. Fungemia is a rare, but a serious complication to treatment with probiotics. Accordingly, the authors find it important to remind the clinicians of this risk when prescribing probiotics especially to immunocompromised patients.

Nearly two months ago, I was dipping my toes back into Everquest II in anticipation of the New Halas update, while simultaneously revisiting Guild Wars due to the 5th Anniversary celebrations and War in Kryta teaser updates. I was certain at the time that come May 25th, I would be re-subscribing to EQII with my better half to fill our time when our Star Trek Online playing has lapsed (which is has). I did not expect to spend much time in Guild Wars, as I was feeling largely burned out on repeating content in pursuit of various achievements.
Suddenly, today is the day, and Guild Wars has delivered a stunning upset. The War In Kryta storyline has begun unfolding in earnest, which has not only provided me with a reason to log in more often to keep up with the events (excellent observation by Ravious of KTR that this content is becoming more event-like), but which has brought in new and old players alike and enabled me to group more often for that same old content I was growing weary of doing by myself. Massively has started a new guild for the purpose of tackling the Prophecies campaign, and I have had the pleasure of grouping up with them for a couple of weeks. I even found two – two! – groups attempting the Dunes of Despair mission and bonus the other night (we failed, alas).
Since ArenaNet now seems determined to keep a Live Team dedicated to providing updates to Guild Wars for as long as its lifespan, and the Guild Wars Beyond campaign is slated to keep us advancing right up to the point that Guild Wars 2 is launched, I now foresee a year where Guild Wars can return to being my main MMO attraction, and I have no further need for diversions. The Peacekeeper bounties provide a satisfying daily goal that fits within my schedule – I don’t even get to these every day, but they’re there if I want to. Courier Falken is a quick and easy run for tokens. I can’t believe I’m advocating for a repeatable quest, but for some reason the good Courier is fun to chase around (it must be his special attack). And in between all of this, I’m getting mission bonuses completed and even taking up vanquishing again with some good advice from friends.
Guild Wars Beyond has truly breathed fresh life into the game from my perspective. It’s amazing how adding one new feature like this has made the entire experience seem new and exciting again, as though I was not there back when Thunderhead Keep existed as a brick wall to beat your head against.
As for my better half: he will join me when his Necromancer can finally jump.

NJ Couple Flees Haunted House, Sues Landlord for Security Deposit
A couple in New Jersey are suing a landlord for their security deposit after fleeing a rental home they say is haunted. The landlord, meanwhile, alleges that the couple is simply trying to break their lease. Who do you believe?
Michele Callan and fiance Josue Chinchilla moved into a home in Toms River, NJ, on March 1st and moved out a week later after experiencing a range of paranormal activity.
The couple says they felt ghostly taps on the shoulder, saw flickering lights, witnessed doors opening and closing and even recorded spectral voices whispering, “Let it burn.” They’re now suing landlord Richard Lopez for the return of their $2,250 deposit.
Lopez, however, quickly filed a counter-suit. “Frankly, there is something else going on,” said Lopez’s lawyer David Semanchik. “[Callan] is a single mom, she has this fiance living with her. I think she is in over her head and she can’t afford the rent.”
What do you think? Is the couple telling the truth? Or are they simply trying to dodge their rent? Either way, the fees from this legal battle promise to be really scary.

Quinoa, a protein rich grain-like seed, has caught the attention of nutritionist and dieters alike. The super food is high in fiber and packed full of a wide variety of vitamins and minerals. Unlike most other superfoods, quinoa is cheap and readily available in the majority of grocery stores. Here are just a few ways that quinoa’s unique nutritional makeup can benefit a healthy diet:
Aids Weight Loss
Quinoa is a filling, low calorie source of complex carbohydrate. It helps to keep you fuller for longer because it contains high levels of fiber and polyunsaturated fats which are digested slowly by the body. It is an ideal low cholesterol alternative to bread, cereal, and other refined carbohydrates.
Perfect Protein for Vegans and Vegetarians
Not only is quinoa high in protein, it also contains all nine essential amino acids. The acids are important for tissue growth and repair, but they are only usually found in meat. The grain is also rich in iron, which is often lacking in meat- free diets. It is eaten much like rice or couscous and makes a convenient staple food in any vegetarian or vegan diet.
Prevents Migraines
The magnesium and riboflavin found in quinoa can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches in migraine sufferers. Magnesium stops blood vessels from constricting while riboflavin helps to improve energy metabolism in muscle cells, reducing the frequency of migraines.
Gluten Free Carbohydrate
Quinoa is a popular choice among celiacs because, unlike couscous and bulgur wheat, it is completely gluten free. It can be used as an easy to cook carbohydrate in any meal and is also available as gluten free flour.
Reduces Postmenopausal Symptoms
Eating quinoa and other high fiber food on a regular basis has been proven to prevent cardiovascular disease among postmenopausal women. A study found that women who ate 6 portions of whole grains a week had a much lower risk of developing high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and other symptoms of cardiovascular disease. It was also found that eating whole grains significantly slows down the narrowing of the arteries.
Quinoa is easy to include in your diet because it can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. It is most commonly used in pure seed form, but it is also available as flakes, flour, pasta, and polenta from specialist food stores.

Catholic churches in western N.C. help build 2011 'Interfaith House'
ASHEVILLE — Four Catholic churches and one college community of Catholic students plan on helping to make a deserving homeowner's dreams come true. The parishes of St. Eugene, St. Lawrence, St. Margaret Mary and St. Barnabas will participate in a Habitat for Humanity project in west Asheville this fall.
Catholic students from the University of North Carolina-Asheville are participating as well, along with eight other faith communities in the Asheville area to build the 2011 Interfaith House for Asheville Habitat for Humanity. Construction should be completed by Oct. 28.
Pictured: Parishioners of St. Eugene Church in Asheville and their pastor, Father Pat Cahill, get to work on building a Habitat for Humanity house, funded in part by the parish's weekly offertory. Four Catholic churches and one college community of Catholic students are working on the project, along with other churches in the Asheville area. (Photo provided)
Betsy Warren, sponsorship coordinator for Asheville Habitat for Humanity, is excited about the new project.
"This 2011 house will be the 13th Interfaith House built by a diverse coalition of faith communities in Buncombe County, and we are proud of not only the project, but of the way it bridges gaps and brings people of different faiths together," Warren said.
More than 150 people will work on the home, for a total of 275 volunteer days contributed by all the churches. In all, it is estimated that more than 1,650 volunteer hours will go into the home's construction. The house itself will be approximately 1,100 square feet and will house a mother and her children who will put "sweat equity" into the project.
The actual cost to Habitat of building the Interfaith House, including land and infrastructure, will be approximately $125,000. A full sponsorship is $55,000. The 12 faith communities sponsoring the Interfaith House expect to raise about $20,000. The balance of funding will come from other donors, from Habitat ReStore sales, and current partner family mortgage payments.
Dan Brown, coordinator for the volunteers from St. Eugene Church, estimates that there will be 35 volunteers from the parish helping with the home. They will work over the course of 50 days to help complete the house.
"Participating with 11 other faith communities is a demonstration of St. Eugene's ecumenical spirit," Brown said. "By helping to provide affordable housing for a deserving family in the Asheville area, parishioners reaffirm St. Eugene's mission statement's call to service within and beyond our boundaries."
St. Eugene Church distributes 10 percent of each week's offertory to numerous local charities, including Habitat. They will contribute more than $2,500 to the cost of the 2011 Interfaith House.
"I believe the Interfaith House project sponsored by Habitat for Humanity is so popular because we can share our resources with others in God's name, see the tangible evidence of our effort, and know that it has a lasting positive impact on making the our community more livable and sustainable," Brown said.

One thing that I notice every year in other sewing bloggers' resolutions (ha! I say "every year" as if I've been doing this for years, but no, this is only the second time I've been participating in the online sewing community) is the desire to get rid of stash fabrics. Somehow, despite our best intentions, we all manage to collect more fabric than we can sew, and that takes up valuable room in both our sewing spaces and our minds! So when Emily aka EmSewCrazy contacted me and suggested that we host a stashbusting sewalong challenge for 2013, I was super excited. I've participated in other sewalongs and challenges before (like Me Made May and the Sew Weekly) and had tons of fun, but I've never started one before, but 2013 is the year of trying new things, so here goes!
Wait, what's this all about?
The 2013 Stashbusting Sewalong is a casual sewalong whose goal is to encourage us to reduce the size of our stashes. If you've got more fabric than you know what to do with, join Emily and me as we systematically purge our stashes by sewing items to fit a series of themes. We've got a whole schedule that you can follow if you need that kind of structure, or you can just join us. If it takes a village to raise a child, well, it takes an online community to bust a stash!
Here's how you can join us!
- Leave a comment here or on Emily's blog with your pledge: "I, _______,commit to using ____ pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Additional option: I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for _______ until ______."
-, and
-! Emily and I have a very helpful Pinterest board going with all sorts of ideas for using up scraps, so you can check it out if you need inspiration. It's up to you if you want to post every month about your project on your blog, but we encourage you to interact with your fellow stashbusters, whether it's through Flickr or blog comments. Besides documenting our own projects, Emily and I will also post round-ups each month of your makes so that you can see all of your fellow stashbusters' projects gathered into one place.
Lastly, if you want to proudly proclaim to the world (or just to the people who have to share a living space with!) that you are Finally Doing Something about that stash, you can grab this nifty button for your blog's sidebar:
The button features a Sewasaurus Rex tackling a piece of stash fabric in a rather, uhh...extreme manner. It was done by one of my former chemistry students; you can check out more of Jen's amazing artwork here, or you can contact her here.
Yeah, yeah, that's great, but what about you? Are you just going to laugh at our stashes and not show your own?
I've got a whole lot of stash fabric that I need to sew up before we move in June, so I am definitely going for serious stashbusting this year. Bonus points to me if I manage to make things that also work for the Historical Sew Fortnightly! Look for a post tomorrow featuring my own guilt-inducing piles and what I plan to make from them.
What about Walnut? Is he stashbusting too?
Nope. Walnut's all about saving all the stash fabric for sleeping on.
Isn't that just like a cat, to be diametrically opposed to everything you want to accomplish?
"I, Gaenor, commit to using at least 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013, especially the ones I bought to make summer dresses for my small (female) human beings.
(Also been meaning to delurk and say thanks for giving me plenty to read this last week since I stumbled across your blog, and for motivating me to actually start making clothes rather than just thinking about it).
I, Cari Homemaker, commit to using at least 25 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. This should make my husband very happy (or at least moderately relieved)
This sewalong is such a great idea to make those stash pieces of fabric just as exciting (or even more so) than buying new stuff.
I, Morgan of Crab&Bee, pledge to use up at least 6 pieces of stashed fabric in 2013.
I don't have a huge stash but it's outgrown my even-less-huge closet shelf! And I definitely keep tiny pieces, so you had me at "scraps". Thanks for setting up this fun challenge!
I, Jane, commit to using at least eight pieces of stash fabric for dressmaking and as many smaller pieces as I can to make bags, cushions and purses.
Great idea Cindy! x
...should have added "in 2013" !
I, Melissa, commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
This is such a great idea and it looks like it will be fun! My stash is getting a little on the scary side...I've been pretty good about not adding too much to it last year, but I need to get some of it used up.
What a great idea, Cindy – I’m in!
I, Andrea of Stitch Parade, commit to using at least 15 pieces of stashed fabric in 2013.
I, Heather, commit to using at least 12 pieces from my remnant stash in 2013, including at least 1 knit.
This is my first sew-a-long, and my first real foray into the sewasaurus community. Your blog has been inspiration and motivation to me. Thanks!
Ooh, fun! Somehow stash-busting seems way more fun in a group! I, Sonja of Ginger Makes,commit to using six pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
I, Elisha,commit to using an undetermined amount pieces of stash fabric (and other things I've thrifted for sewing purposes, including bandannas and tablecloths) in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for lining fabric, maybe some fabric for cargoes for my husband, zippers and buttons if I really need them, a couple of .99 cent big four patterns (including my husbands aforementioned cargo shorts pattern), and really hard to pass up thrift store items, until 2014!
I'd been planning on stash busting anyway, so this sew along is one I can actually get behind!
I, Elizabeth (aka Sully Liz or The Cataloguer), commit to using up at least half of my stash fabric in 2013 (approx 8 fabrics). I also commit to not buying any new fabric except to fill out a garment which is using up a stash fabric, until June 2013."
I, Sara Mayo (blogless), commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to only buying new fabric/lining/thread/zippers/etc as necessary to do one project at a time. Patterns I'm still allowed to buy.
I, Trisha from Made By Trisha, commit to using 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Stashbusting as a group sounds like a good motivator!
Radness. I have just rebuilt my stash so I'm more than happy to jump ofn this train to awesome town. I, Amanda, will rock out to stash busting by using 5 pieces of truly epic stash fabric in 2013.
I am so IN!! I'll have to take a good look around the sewing room and decide how many pieces I'll commit to this year. Maybe I should commit by yardage?? Or weight??
That said, I, Katie from Kadiddlehopper, will commit to stashbusting an as yet to be determined amount from my stash in 2013, and also to not purchasing new fabric if equivalent yardage has not already been used.
OK, it's official. As in, I posted it, so I am officially committed.).
Oooh--I like this! I, Jenny of Bobbins and Whimsy, commit to using up 75% of my stashed fabric in 2013. I also commit to buying no new fabric except for linings and such to use up my stashed fabric--and also I really want something emerald green to wear to a wedding in April :) But that's it.
75% !!!
You are an inspiration...
Great idea! Since I've added at least ten new fabrics to my stash since we moved and haven't been able to sew a single stitch, I'd say a bit of commitment is in order (once my machines are up and running again, of course).
I, Jennifer of The Musings of a Dedicated Housefiancee, do hereby pledge to sew no less than eight fabrics from my current stash, including at least one reserved for my fiance (you know, that guy that buys it all!).
This is such a good idea - I love your plan!
I don't know if I can commit but this is a great challenge!
Shame induced stash busting. I love the idea, and I'm already on it - count me in! At the end of the year I actually fondled and measured every single piece of fabric in my stash (not including muslin and scraps) - 82.6m. It's my goal to get down to 50m by 2013 end. I might even join in a few of your themed months.
I, Melanie, commit to using 30m of stash fabric in 2013. Lock Me In.
I love this plan and I'm in!
I, Barbara, commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I'll try not to buy any new patterns for myself, but I may buy other sizes for other people I sew for.
Thank you for hosting!
This is a great idea. It ties in nicely with my New Year plans as well.
So, I, Giggles in the Sun, commit to using 26 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buy any new fabric until September except for if I find the perfect 'cape' fabric (and lining) to make for this coming winter.
I feel like I need to give myself an additional incentive though, maybe a nice meal in September or a daytrip somewhere, hmmm
I, Michelle, commit to using as much stash fabric as possible in 2013. I will considerably slow down the pace of additions to my stash.
Since I'm having a baby in 3 months, I don't know how aggressive I can be in my de-stashing, but I really have some great fabrics and ideas that need to be made into realities. Hopefully I can make a meaningful dent in the stash even with the new baby!
I love the idea and am glad to know I'm not the only stasher!
I, SeamstressErin, pledge to use 18 pieces of stash fabric this year.
I have to say that it's not going to be that hard since my stash takes an entire bookshelf (and then some). But I'm committed!
I'm also doing the Historical Sew Fortnightly so this ties in well. I, Rachelle, commit to using fifteen pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Additional option: I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for items needed to complete projects until 2014. I'm also working on the same concept with my yarn stash.
I really need to finish the spreadsheet with my fabric stash so I know exactly what I have.
I've already used 12 so I think I can update this to using at least 20 pieces of fabric.
Brilliant brilliant idea! Even as a relatively new sewer, my stash is starting to get out of my control :) so here it is:
I, Sophie of Monbouton's Needles, pledge to use at least one piece of stash fabric for every month of 2013. I will be perusing your Pinterest boards for inspiration!
This is great! I could never commit to not buying new fabric, but I feel confident to succeed in a challange like this. So count me in!
I, Johanna of projects by me,commit to using at least 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
I'm in! My fabric stash is completely out of control, it's literally flowing over. I can't even remember what's in there...
I, Cherise from VintageFollies,commit to using at least 2 pieces of stash fabric in 2013!
I, Janelle of Sew Hopeful, commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to no new pattern purchases except anything released by Sewingcake.com and no new fabric purchases except for my couture dress class until I have used up said 12 pieces of stash fabric.
Great idea ladies. I'm looking forward to the fun. Both my pattern and my fabric stash is somewhat out of hand.
"I, Niamh,commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013."
I'm afraid I can't commit to the second, i'm going to china and I kinda need to buy fabric there.
Let the stashbusting begin!
"I, Dottie Doodle, commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013." Thank you for this - I'd already made a stash busting resolution, but having structure and a group to sew with will make it much more fun!
I'm in! I have a serious problem with stashing, so this should help! Thanks for hosting :)
I, Shivani (of pins & needles), commit to using at least 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. (I'd like to commit to not adding to the stash, but I know myself too well.)
So now I need to list it all, and rediscover what I actually have!
"I, Jessiekay ,commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013 and will post about it on my blog. This will force me to sew! I've added your button and will post about it soon. Great idea thanks!
I'll join as well. I have a lot of fabric and really should use more of it.
I, Lynn of You sew girl!, commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to using at least 10 patterns from the stash. Stash includes any fabric or patterns on hand prior to the date of this pledge, 15 Jan 2013.
I, Amanda of The Adventures of Lady Smijubug, commit to using at least 25 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new sewing supplies beyond those necessary for stash-busting projects until January of 2014.
Projects to be posted here:
This Is a fantastic idea. I won't be taking the pledge though, since I've only been sewing for 2 years and my stash is still quite small. I'm also trying to do the historical sew fortnightly, and there's no way I can do that without buying new fabric. The sewasaurus drawing is awesome!
P.S, I'm considerably taller than most mice so I'm not afraid of Walnut. I think cats are adorable.
I, Jennifer of FernKnits, commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying anymore fabric until I have used up these 12 pieces of stash fabric.
This is awesome! I want to take the pledge even though my stash is small. I think I really just love the cool button, though! This is my first time on your blog, and I like it!
I, Chelsea of Scrapyard Butterfly, commit to making at least one project a month from stashed fabric in 2013. This is my first sew along, and hopefully the kick in the pants I need to get sewing again.
Awesome! I, lyndle, commit to making at least 8 garments from stash fabrics and patterns in 2013.
I also commit to pruning and organising my pattern collection.
I also commit to not buying a fabric unless I already know I require for a particular garment and there is no suitable fabric in stash. (I know this sounds lame but its the best I can make myself do, right now!
I also commit to recording honestly all my spending on sewing supplies during 2013.
OK, I give in! I Angela Denny commit to making at least 5 items from stash fabrics in 2013. I also commit to self drafting or using patterns that I already own!
This sounds like a silly thing to ask, but I'm not sure I can commit to a whole year of stashbusting, I don't think my stash is big enough for that!
Can I, and others still participate in the activities from time to time?
Of course you can! We are happy to have any and all sewists join us, regardless of stash size. The goal here is to sew with fabric, and not just store it, so feel free to join in whichever challenge or theme you see fit!
I love my stash, but there are definitely opportunities for busting lurking in there.
I pledge to sew 3/4 of all projects in 2013 from Stash.
Fabric acquistion will not outweigh or include more yardage than the stash sewing in 2013.
THIS is going to hurt...
"I,Tiffany McGuire aka the Sewing Amazon,commit to using 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new and non-essential fabric/patterns/ notions until all 10 pieces are used up (unless it's relevant to one of the 10 projects)."
I think we may need to start shipping out tea and support t-shirts to keep us relaxed and on the right path when our hands start itching to buy just that one, BEAUTIFUL, MUST-HAVE piece of fabric...
Just a thought!!
Great idea!! This is definitely something that's shared by most of us.
amazonsews.blogspot.com
This sounds like fun!
I Carolyn, of Handmade by Carolyn, commit to using at least two, hopefully more! pieces of fabric from the stash, each month for this year.
I, Towanda, commit to using as many as possible pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I am committing to spend at least 15 minutes in my sewing room 4-5 days a week. I also committing to not buying any new fabric except for fabric that I need to finish a collection or special one time pieces that I can't easily find again.
Oooh, that commitment to be in the sewing room for at least 15 minutes is such a good idea!
You know what, I don't do "sewalongs" much because for some reason I dislike the constraining idea of it. And I'm super neurotic about jumping my project queue, just can't do it. But this is a challenge I can get behind, mostly because I've already gone a whole month without new fabric. So here it is:
I, Molly,commit to using LOTS (specific numbers are also too constricting!) pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric except for linings and notions until June (I can't guarantee I won't laps around my birthday...).
Also, I just really want that blog button... haha!
I, Suzy, commit to using as many pieces as possible of stash fabric in 2013. I am commiting to not buying any fabric just because its cheap and only getting fabric I have a clear idea for and is a natural fabric (no more polyester knits!)
I, Carol,commit to using as many pieces of stash fabric as I possibly can in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for SWAP until June 30, 2013. I started destashing late last year, so this suits me perfectly.
I, Sarah, commit to using stash fabric for at least 50% of my sewing projects in 2013.
I was planning to try to make a dent in the monster fabric closet of doom anyway, but now it's set down in righting, so I have to, haha. I likely won't follow along with the monthly challenges, but the sewasaurus button was too cute not to join up!
I, Gretchen, commit to using at least 16 pieces of stash fabric for my sewing projects in 2013. I also commit to using 4 pieces of stash fabric for every 1 new piece I may not be able to resist buying.
This is my first time posting here, but have been enjoying your blog for a long time. Stash busting (fabric and patterns) is one of my two main goals for the year (the other is fit), so I'm excited to join your sewalong!
Oh heck yes! Gotta love a challenge when there are themes involved! ;-)
I, Kat,commit to using as many pieces of stash fabric as possible in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for things that I don't have and need to finish projects (e.g. interfacing) during 2013.
I am SO in! I shall have to have a think about how much I want to use and come back with my pledge. But after a tidy and measure of my stash over the holidays I'm a little shocked by how much I've accumulated!
I don't have a blog, so cannot nab the wondermous button. *sigh*
But, I DO have a stash that far exceeds my life expectancy, as do many of us, so I will publicly commit to join the cause. To wit: I, Caroleleah, commit to using at least 6 stash fabrics in 2013, from whatever stash I own prior to this date. I also commit to not buying a single yard new unless I've sewn up two yards in exchange. One in, two out. (A purchasing loophole!! lol!) I shall record ALL purchases and makes, to keep me honest. Notions or lining fabrics will be allowed if they really honestly cannot be located in my stash. I will TRY to stop buying patterns, once the current auctions off of eBay have ended. *grins* There, I've publicly committed. (EEEK!)
Oh boy am I in! I may need to make an adjustment to the vow though.
I, tigergirl,commit to using a lot of pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/notions except for those that I need immediately to finish current projects until August.
Perfect timing - I have just restarted my blog with the hope that it will motivate me to tackle my stash. Well here goes:
I, Taracat,commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric or patterns until I have used at least six pieces of fabric and four new patterns from my stash.
I, Alice of heteronormative lovefest,commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
This is great! I needed some structure to my sewing. And my sewing room is destined to become a kid's room soonish, so de-stashing a bit is getting to be a higher and higher priority. Internet camaraderie for the win!
I, Jen, of madeonthecouch,commit to using twelve pieces of stash fabric (and at least five balls of yarn)in 2013! As a person from parents who hoard, I'm terrified one day I'll wake up and discover a mountain of fabric in my house that's destroyed because it has been there for too long! Bah. Since I bought like seven different fabrics when I was on holiday in Borneo recently, I have an uphill battle ahead of me I think haha!
Most excellent as sewing up the stash is also my goal for 2013.
I Heather of handmadebyheather commit to using at least 12 pieces of fabric from the stash. Bonus points if more pieces are sewn up. I also pledge to actually sew up a few of those precious pieces that have been marinating in the stash too long.
I, Arellis, of SewOpenSundays, commit to sewing at least half of my stash on 2013. I also will not buy any new fabric unless I really need it for a specific project I am working on. Oh, and if I buy fabric 2 existing pieces need to be used first (to keep the stash down).
First sewalong and I'm very excited, especially since I really need to stop accumulating and start sewing!
I, Silvia of Sil's Fab Knitblog, commit to sewing at least 10 projects with stashed fabric in 2013. Bonus points for knitting up some stashed yarn. I will try with all my might not to purchase fabric until I've used up some of the garage stash.
I, Christina of Dolcideleria, hesitate to actually make a commitment due to my tendency to sign up for everything! But it's already my intention to do lots of sewing in 2013 from fabric I already have (especially since 2012 seemed to be the year of buying fabric). 2013 is going to be the year I finish things, whether it's items for my Wardrobe Improvement Project or any of the 8 quilts currently in progress. I have plans for several small projects (laptop covers) that will also draw from my stash.
I don't know that I'll be able to participate in many of the awesome sounding challenges and contests, but I'll be lurking and watching and cheering you on!
Hahaha it seems we have a lot of commitment phobics here! But like I said, putting it out there publicly for some accountability can do wonders. 2012 was also my fabric-buying year, so I am with you on 2013 being the year of actually finishing stuff! And wow, 8 quilts in progress!
Feel free to lurk...the challenges aren't a requirement, just a helpful structure for those of us who need it!
I, Jessica, commit to using 8 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to getting rid of fabrics I'm never going to sew by donating them, giving them away, selling them on ebay, stuffing them in other projects as fill, or by employing the good ol' garbage can. I also commit to adding no more than 5 fabrics to the stash. Fabric purchased with a plan not included. :)
Jessica I like all you idea...except the garbage can! The thrift stores do not do so well with donated fabrics, but check out your local church. They always have one grand all-church yard sale/bazaar and would love your donation. I am sure that whatever denomination it is they would welcome your cast-offs and give a picker like me a chance at them! :)
I, Debi, commit to using 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Yay!
I, Holly,commit to using 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Additional option: I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns until I'm down to only 4 pieces of unused fabric.
I also might begin with the vibrant color because I have some red jersey I want to use to test out combining a pencil skirt pattern and a top pattern into a dress. I'm not sure I have small pieces of fabric. I usually get rid of them.
I also vow to finish up the recovering of a chair project that I began two weeks ago.
I meant I vow to finish the chair before the end of January. In place of the small pieces project.
I, Sharon of Petite and Sewing, commit to sew ¾ of all projects in 2013 from Stash. Fabric purchases will be less than the yardage used during the stash sewing in 2013.
I haven't got much of a stash (okay, maybe I'm kidding myself just a bit) but this sounds like fun!
"I, Meraj of Threaded Dances, commit to using 8 pieces of stash fabric in 2013."
I LOVE THIS BLOG BUTTON!!! also, I love this challenge, so count me in!
I, Sally (thequirkypeach), commit to using at least twelve pieces of stash fabric in 2013. For every completed stash piece OVER twelve, I will buy myself something delicious at Starbucks! (now that's motivation right there :)
Thanks for hosting this! Also, thank you former chemistry student Jen for being an awesome artist!
For better or for worse I, Kat of All the whimsical things, commit to using as many pieces as possible of stash fabric in 2013. I commit to not buying any new fabric or patterns (with exceptions) until June 2013.
I, Alison of Acorn Cottage, commit to using only pieces of stash fabric for my garment sewing in 2013. I will only purchase whatever notions, thread, interfacing and suchlike are needed to complete said garments. I also commit to finally getting the stash organised, and out of the bins boxes and bags that are scattered all over the house!
I'm in!
My pledge is to use at least 3 metres of fabric from my stash for every metre I buy throughout 2013.
I Hanny Bobbins commit to using ten items from my stash in 2013!
I, Laura (of a currently post-less blog), commit to using at minimum six pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
And hopefully I will! I don't think that I finished more than four projects in 2012! (And some of those were... possibly alterations, depending on how that is defined).
I, Meris (aka the Fabric Alchemist), commit to using at least one piece of stash fabric in every sewing project in 2013. I also commit to not buying new fabric in 2013 for stand alone projects. New fabrics must be used alongside stash fabric to complete the larger project (e.g. a costume).

I Shawn (creativeinspiraciones), commit to using a lot of pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I will make my best attempt to use stash fabric before purchasing any additional fabric. I do not have many pieces larger than fat quarters, so if the project requires a bigger chunk I can add to it by way of purchase. However, I am not aloud to start any new projects that require all new fabic. If I do not have any of the material for the project in my stash, I can not add it to the to do list. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/notions except for must haves to complete a project until all of my current projects are completed.
I Alethia commit to using more of my stash fabric in 2013.
I will try my best not buy any new fabric unless I really need it for a specific project I am working on. If I buy fabrics for every yard of fabric I buy 2 yards from my stash will be used or give away (to keep the stash down).
I, Nikki of Nikki's Stitches, commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I'd love to say I'll not buy any more, can I qualify that I'll not buy any full price - only if they're in a sale? :-)
I'll even use at least one piece for un-selfish sewing, ie for someone else!
I, The Urban Pheasant, pledge to stash bust at least 1 well aged stash piece each month this year. I will start by making yo-yo's with tiny cotton bits while watching hockey games (they're BAAAACK!) this year. I need at least 1339 yo-yos for a quilt, so let the stash busting begin!
I'm late to the party but... I'm in! I, Nic of The Reckless Needle, pledge to make 12 projects using stash fabric in 2013. I haven't been sewing long enough (and don't have enough of a monster stash) to commit to not buying any more fabric but I'm moving in two months and there won't be as much space in the new house for fabric! Thanks for the great idea!
me, Riet, (blog memadeland@wordpress.com)pledge to use stash for 12 projects in 2013. Although it's gonna be dificult finding time after my baby will be born in april.
Knitting up stash doesn't count I guess... :-)
It will be my very first sewalong, I'm looking forward to it!
Can I join in?! Just found your fantastic blog and am now following. Can't wait to join in the stash busting!
"I, Alison of Heavenly Handmades, commit to using at least 50% of my very considerable abount of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for interfacing until at least 25% has been used up."
What a great idea! This was already one of my goals for this year and a sewalong is going to make it so much more fun - and motivational. :)
I, Diana, (@ writeforward.wordpress.com)commit to using at least 12 pieces of my fabric stash in 2013 (with hopes to completely deplete it, and I will not buy any fabric unless it is absolutely necessary.
I've been meaning to get off my blogging backside and get my sewing blog going. Killing off some of my stash in the process can only be a Good Thing. Considering I got fabric for every single gifting holiday last year, if I don't do something soon, the storage bins are going to explode.
I, V of SometimesSheSews.blogspot.com,commit to using a very unambitious 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Additional option: I also commit to not buying any new fabric not counting interfacing, fabrics already purchased this year or accent fabric needed to complete a project. Patterns, notions and sewing tools are not counted or considered stash items, and will be bought as the need/sale arises.
Sounds fun!
I, Megan, commit to using 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
“I, Sølvi of delfinelise, commit to using mostly pieces of fabric from my stash in 2013. I aim to use 11 pieces for myself and 5 for others the first 6 months, and I will revise how I´ve done every month. Depending on how I do, I will commit to more, or less, for the last 6 months of 2013.”
Wohoo! Thank you ever so much for hosting this! :-)
I love this idea, but have way too much going on (and one super all-consuming sewing project) to start this off now--would I be able to jump in mid-year?
You can jump in at any time you want! It's very open-ended so as to accommodate all levels of sewist and stash!
Ok, I'm in then! Although it'll be awhile before I can fully participate with the monthly challenges.
"I, Becky, commit to using 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric, other than interfacing/notions, things for the wedding, or absolutely necessary home dec fabric. In addition, I commit to evaluating my current stash and getting rid of the things that I honestly can't find a use for."!
I, Chloe of Buttonandneedle, commit to making one stash busting project each month in 2013! And to think very carefully before buying new patterns - my biggest temptation!
Can't wait to see those bins start to empty - thanks for the challenge!
I, Leah, commit to using 15 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Additional option: I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for needles and thread and zippers until July (my birthday month!).
Holy hell do I need this. I will do this. I WILL. I CAN DO IT. Thank you for this, Cindy and Emily, it's so on!
strugglesewsastraightseam.wordpress.com
A bit late, but better late than never, right? ;)
I, Alessa of, commit to using as many pieces of stash fabric as I manage in 2013, making at least three in four makes from fabrics already in my stash. I also commit to only buy one new length of fabric for every three finished stash-busting projects until my birthday in July.
I sooo need to do this. But since I like to pick up fabric during my travels I can't commit to not ever buying new fabric this year. So hopefully I can participate only in the stash-busting part of the challenge. SO here it is: I, Javie,commit to using at least 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I know I could exceed this but want to make this at least doable for me.
I, Lara,commit to using 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/ notions except for fabric for a swimsuit (needed for Hawaii – see previous post) and zips until I have at least halved my current pile! Sometimes it just takes that little reminder/ push to remind me of what I should have been doing all along. I am going to save so much time and money with this, thanks! Lara x
Oh man I should join this challenge. I really should but I know my limits lol. I am sewing more out of stash than before so at least I'm there partly in spirit hey?
I, sarah commit to using at least 24 pieces of fabric out of my stash in 2013. I have to. I'm running out of space for it all :/ I make no promises not to replace them however.......
Whoa, I am so late for this, but I really, really need it! Wonderful idea!
I, aleah of notimetosew.wordpress.com, commit to sewing from the stash by default this whole year. I furthermore commit to not buying any fabric I haven't touched in person first (I'm saying no to online fabric buying), or that I don't have a concrete plan for.
Let's bust!
I, Bailey of knitsnbobs.blogspot.com ,commit to using at LEAST 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
Yep, I'm in on this one, I'm just getting back into my sewing room and I need to sew from the huge stash I have. I'll commit to not purchase new fabric in 2013 except what is necessary to finish a project I'm working on. This is just what I need to get my juices flowing!!
I, Kelley, of simplesewist.blogspot.com.au, commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
Oh this is just what I was looking for!
I Penny, of Hands Sew Full (handssewfull.blogspot.ca) commit to using up as much of my "hoarders look innocent compared to me" stash as possible in 2013. I also commit to restricting my fabric and notion etc purchases to solely what is needed to finish a stash project and possibly a few particularly incredible "extras" that may never come my way again.
Thanks for hosting!
I just found your challenge; I'm in!
"I, Sharon, commit to reducing my stash fabric by 30 yards in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabrics or notions --except those explicitly needed to finish a current project -- until the end of the year."
Just stumbled across your lovely blog. What a great idea - count me in (goodness knows, I need the help!)
I, Jude (aka Verdant), commit to using up at least two crates worth of fabric (about 20 pieces) and all the loose bits on the floor. I also commit to finish each project and not leaving any languishing a year waiting for sleeves or buttonholes.
Thanks for the inspiration and incentive :-)
"I, Edris,commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to buying fabric/patterns/ notions on a as needed basis and not for the sheer purpose of hoarding:)
Ladies... I re-sew-lutely commit to this great idea :)
"I, Claire of the blog sew-incidentally.com, commit to using 9 pieces of stash fabric in 2013."
These stash pieces will be used in sewing match-up alongside my commitment to making 7 garments and 2 accessories for Karen's of "Did You Make That?" 2013 Sewlutions - In the Jar... this year I mean to "put my money where my mouth is!"
I, Rachel,commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. For this year, I will only buy necessary fabric for any historical costuming, but it will be used right away and only bought on an as needed basis after the project has been completely planned out and I check my stash first to make sure that I don't already have something that would work.
I think that's reasonable enough and I can keep to it. I'm not including notions in that, just fabric. Notions are a little trickier.
I, Becca, commit to using at least 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013, plus clean out at least 8 remnant pieces. I also want to use at least 7 of my current pattern stash.
I'm not going to say that I won't buy more fabric, because I'm not overloaded stash wise, but I do want to rotate out some of my older pieces to make room for new pretties and also expand my sad wardrobe.
I, Anneloes, (aka Oes), commit to using up at least 10 pieces of stash. I also commit to finish each project and not buying any new fabric till june, except for lining, batting and sutch.
Since i'm due to give birth to our first in 2 weeks i hope to join the mothly themes and challanges, but i will be reasonable and kind to my self for the months march, april and may. I have no idea if i will be ableto produce anything in those first months. (I'm making something now for febuary, so unless the baby arrives in 3 days I'll manage the febuary challange)
A bit late to the party here but I really wanted to think about what I wanted to do. I didn't want to set myself up for using a particular number of pieces of stash as I'm not al that productive and that seemed like a way to fail! And I've set myself a goal involving numbers already.
But I DO want to use up stash pieces. So, after ponderification and mullingness, I, Joy of Charm of Magpies, commit to starting ALL of my crafting projects in 2013 (sewing, knitting, jewellery making, etc) from materials I own RIGHT NOW and turning to stash before external sources for all notions where possible. The one exception is my annual ball dress and any other event-specific garments that may have requirements my stash can't fulfill. I also commit to trying-really-hard to not buying new stash!
It might be a bit lacklustre but I think it is achievable and that is what counts :)
I, Shannon, commit to using 4 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
I'm really just getting back into sewing and my stash is small-just one box. But I do want to use it all up. And I love the challenge ideas.
The Finished Garment
I only have a small stash - just one box, but I do want to use it up, so here's my pledge:
"I, Shannon, commit to using 4 pieces of stash fabric in 2013."
I love the challenge ideas. I can't want to get started.
The Finished Garment
I don't have much of a stash but its slowly adding up, so.
I,Annei,commit to using at lest 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
I will strive to use the fabric I have bought for certain patterns and make the item or use it for something that I will ware.
I will try to only buy fabric for clothing I will make not just because I like the fabric.
I, Vanessa, commit to using at least 6 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to finishing garments that have gotten stuck halfway through.
I'm a bit late jumping on board, but I think this is a great way to keep me sewing all year long. I've only got 1 tub of fabric, but it has reached critical mass and my apartment can't afford to have it overflow.
I, Lise, commit to using at least 20 pieces of fabric from my enourmous stash by the end of 2013. I will not buy any new fabric this year, except what is needned to finish a project. I also commit to finish each project completely before starting a new one.
I, Holly,commit to using 12 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
Additional: I also commit to using at least two thirds of all new fabrics that I buy myself this year.
I know I'm late to join, but I have been thinking about it, trying to come up with a goal that is challenging yet achievable.
I, Pickled Weasel commit to using 10 pieces of stash fabric in 2013.
I'm a bit late joining, but I really ummed and ahhed when the stashbust was announced originally as I worried I wouldn't be able to honour any pledges I made. Only I just realised I've sewn three things with fabric from my stash already this year so maybe I can do it after all! And by a happy coincidence the last thing I made was for my daughter, so it qualifies for the Feb. challenge :)
Is it too late to join? I just heard about this from Four Square Walls.
My pledge is to use up ten pieces of stash fabric for the rest of the year. I also pledge that the number of fabric pieces I buy must be less than or equal to the number of fabric pieces I use up every month.
I, Amanda, pledge to sew the next six garments I make from my stash (excepting notions, muslin, and interfacing!).
I, Helen, commit to using 19 pieces of my stash this year. 2 per month, 1 for March, since it's part gone. I am aiming to use this as an opportunity for adventure, to try some ideas, if only to use up fabric.
Getting my "acres" in, ala Kenneth King:. Kenneth King
I earnestly commit to making ten things in 2013 from yardage I already have. Easy Peasy. I will avoid fabric purchases, unless it is lining fabric..I don't have any of that. I also don't think yard sale fabrics and gifts of yardage count. There is never that much of it and I refuse to return gifts that I really want!
I ,in addition, will commit to mixing and matching lining colors in order to use it all up. Should be interesting.
"I, Nancy,commit to using 9 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. Additional option: I also commit to not buying any new fabric/patterns/notions except for back yard finds, church bazaar goodies, vintage patterns and lining fabrics until Jan 2014! Oh, and if somebody gives me fabric, I am keeping it!
"I, Ebi of Mostly Raaw Edges, commit to sewing only from stash fabric in April 2013, by creating projects for what I have. I commit to using at least six pieces of stash fabric this month, and buying fewer pieces of fabric than I use from my stash."
Ooh, hopefully this will keep me motivated and honest!
"I, Lyn of Poofytail, commit to using 25 pieces of stash fabric in 2013. I also commit to not buying any new fabric except for supplies needed to finish a project or fabric to make things for other people until the end of the year, with the exception that I can buy one new piece of fabric for my birthday."

Apply for CertificationHelp Organic Grow
Recently, the NOP issued final rules and instructions to certifiers that provide important improvements to certification and require certifiers to raise the bar for both unannounced inspections and testing. These efforts help ensure that organic certification is rigorous and meaningful in the marketplace while guaranteeing that all NOP certified operations and certifiers are required to meet similar requirements. CCOF has performed both unannounced inspections and residue testing for some time and is therefore pleased to see these requirements effectively instituted by NOP. We salute the National Organic Program’s (NOP) commitment to improving the implementation of organic certification.
On January 1, 2013, the National Organic Program’s (NOP) Final Rule regarding Pesticide Residue Testing went into effect. This final standard mandates that certifiers perform residue testing of a minimum of 5% of their certified operations. CCOF has been preparing for this requirement by performing residue testing for several years, providing feedback to NOP and working with other groups to ensure the final rule did not pose an undue burden on CCOF operations or farms exclusively.
The NOP implemented the vast majority of CCOF and partner organization comments on the proposed rule. We are extremely pleased that the NOP has provided certifiers with significant discretion regarding the type of testing, reasons, and materials tested within the rule.
The new rule allows certifiers to test for a wide variety of residues including:
Tests may be based on random selection, complaints, investigations or risk analysis and all tests performed count towards the 5% minimum. In addition, the rule allows tests of plant parts, soil, water, and finished products instead of only farm gate products as was initially proposed. This establishes the rule as an effective compliance monitoring tool. CCOF worked hard to ensure this degree of flexibility, which will help ensure the efficacy of residue testing while ensuring that the entire organic community is subject to similar requirements. Certifiers may not charge operations for testing. The improved final rule will benefit CCOF operations and consumers by increasing consumer confidence.
After recommendations from the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) the NOP has released NOP Handbook Instruction Policy 2609 regarding Unannounced Inspections (NOP 2609: Unannounced Inspections). This policy is intended to provide consistent application of NOP standards by recommending certifiers perform unannounced inspections of at least 5% of their operation annually. CCOF has actively lobbied for this clarification which requires all certifiers to meet the same percentage of unannounced inspections CCOF already performs annually.
The NOP instruction document describes certifier best practices and reflects many CCOF comments to the NOSB and NOP. CCOF is well positioned to meet the requirements and does not foresee an additional burden for CCOF clients. CCOF operations are generally not charged for unannounced inspections unless they are mandated as a part of ongoing monitoring of their operation.

Volume 45 Number 41 329 Broadway., Bethpage, NY 11714 Nov. 2 - 8 , 2007 (516)681-0440 ext. 21 FAX (516)681-9354 Email: Nuz2u@aol.com 50 Cents Enhancing Facilities at Bethpage Schools Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto recently visited with officials at JFK Junior High School in Bethpage, where the Town installed new bleachers. On hand were Liz Cotton (PTA President at JFK Middle School), Linda Mangano (PTA President Bethpage H.S.), Ralph Tocco (Asst. Principal), Kerri McCarthy (Principal), Tom Frost (Bd. Of Ed. V.P.), Richard Marsh (Supt. of Schools), Supervisor Venditto and County Legislator Ed Mangano. It has been a productive summer and fall in the Bethpage School District. Several District building improvements and initiatives have been completed, and as a result Building core systems have been enhanced and communication between school and home has been improved. Bethpage Superintendent of Schools Dr. Richard Marsh provided the community with a thorough update of the progress at the September Board of Education meeting, and continues to provide capital project status reports at many public meetings. A Bright Future for Energy Savings New energy efficient lighting has been installed throughout the District, most notably at Kramer Lane Elementary School and the Bethpage High School gymnasium. As the result of an energy performance contract with Johnson Controls, schools have brighter, more efficient lighting, equipped with motion sensor detectors that automatically shut off lights when a room is unoccupied. This, coupled with the reduced kilowatts used by the new lighting, and energy efficient windows and weather stripping installed under the 2000 facilities improvement bond, results in significant energy conservation and considerable utility cost savings. Additionally, as a result of the energy performance contract, a new, more efficient boiler system was installed at JFK Middle School. Improved Athletic, Phys Ed Facilities In addition to the new lighting installed at the Bethpage High School gymnasium, the expansive wood floor was refurbished this past summer. Last year, new bleachers were installed in the gymnasium as a result of some of the proceeds from the community-approved sale of Borella Field. The Town of Oyster Bay also agreed to donate new exterior bleachers for the playing field at JFK Middle School. The bleachers were recently installed and will provide many years of service for sporting events and activities and were donated to the school by from the Town of Oyster Bay with the help of Supervisor John Venditto. Restroom Restoration Completed Restrooms at Central Boulevard Elementary School have been renovated using monies in the District's Capital Improvement Fund. Since the 2000 facilities bond and the creation of the Capital Improvement Fund from the Borella Field sale, the District has been systematically upgrading restrooms at all of the schools. Full-Day Kindergarten Plans Approved The State Education Department (SED) has approved building expansion plans at the District's schools that accommodate the implementation of a Full-Day Kindergarten Program. In May 2007, voters approved the plan, which capitalizes on a one-time New York State EXCEL grant that will significantly offset costs associated with expanding the kindergarten program. Dr. Marsh said the project remains on schedule and the program is still on track to begin September 2008. Ground should be broken for construction to begin in November. Parents Connected with New Phone System This fall the District is implementing a new telephone alert system called "Connect-Ed." The system, which is widely used by school districts throughout the country, enables the District to automatically send blanket pre-recorded phone messages to all Bethpage parents in a matter of minutes. Connect-Ed is commonly used to get important messages to parents in a timely manner, such as a school closure or school emergency. A Wireless Bethpage HS Dr. Marsh also announced that Bethpage High School is now a wireless "hot spot." This means that computers used in the school no longer are required to be plugged into a port in order to access the Internet, but rather gain automatic access. Commonly referred to as "Wi-Fi," this technology is a great benefit to students and staff using laptops, and offers them mobile Internet access throughout the classrooms, cafeterias, labs, and study areas, such as the library. A wireless network has the same level of security as the standard network. Only registered computers can gain access and all computers still use the District's filtered Internet.

The number one question I get asked is "How do I make my boss understand the importance of social media and...
<|endofexample|>
One.
I have been overwhelmed with work – hence my absence from Twitter and blogging – but I thought I had to “let the cat out of the bag”.
#1 – Taking up a Touch Typing Course – LIE!!!
It is true that I’ve always envied people who can touch type… I can type fairly fast, but I still have to look at the keys as I do it. I have tried a few websites (such as Touch Typing ) that help you improve your typing – and hopefully teach you how to touch type. But I have to admit to never being resilient enough to get through any of them.
#2 – Teaching at a University – TRUE!!!
Despite what many people from the PLN thought (and said as much in their comments) about the timing not being right (I’ve been teaching English for 18 years – it just wouldn’t add up), it is true. Right after I got my BA in Graphic Design, there was a selection for teachers at the same university where I had studied (and the only one with a graphic design course at the time), because so many teachers were abroad getting their post-graduate studies done. I got the job (I have to admit that I believe what got me the job was the “class” I had to teach to the team of professors who were in the selection committee - I was fresh out of college, but had been teaching – English – for a few years, so I think it gave me an upperhand). I taught the history classes: art history (focusing on design), Design History, Typography History (1 and 2) and Science and Technology History. I had that job for 2 years, before I got fed up with politics and people pressuring me to teach in a more traditional way. Then I quit. but my love for art never changed
But during those two years I still kept my job as an English teacher at a private language course. I only taught English on Saturdays. That is how I was able to do both things, and that’s what makes the timing work.
#3 – At my Wedding, the Groom Fainted – TRUE!!!
Yes, my (now ex) husband fainted, twice, during our wedding. It was a combination of nerves, heat – we got married in January, which is high summer here – not having eaten well during the day… He fainted twice. After the second time, I said I’d only go on if we were given chairs and they found fans to place right next to us. My requests were met and the ceremony went on… for another hour!!!! It was truly an unforgettable wedding, and an experience I have no desire to live again. Later that night he even asked me to tell him about the wedding – he had no recollection
#4 – I am as Fluent in Spanish as I am in English – LIE!!!
I have formally studied both French and Spanish, but have not mastered any of them. Although I can get around on my Spanish – I got to the advanced level and the similarity between Portuguese and Spanish helps – I am (by far) not fluent on it. I won’t even comment about my French!
#5 – I Was a Successful Javelin Athlete – TRUE!!!
While I went to high school in the US, I had the chance of being more active and practicing many sports. When track season came, the school’s coach made me try all sports, since I had no idea if I was any good at anything. Surprisingly enough, I was really good at javelin throw. I won a few medals in competitions among schools – even a few big meetings! And if I have failed to remember what was my best mark, it’s only because it has been so long (20 years!!!). I guess I had a good arm
So, there you have it. The truth. And if I learned something with this challenge it is that I am a good liar (thankfully I don’t do it often enough to have realized that before!) and that my PLN has sooooo little faith in my physical abilities!
Shame on you!!!
So Alfonso, you were the only one who caught my lies!!! Good one!
Ha, ha! Yay!
You really were a good liar though.
So I completely suck at guess your lies. So what?
*pout*
Yes, it was you telling Dave that you threw the javelin 100metres that made me believe that one. Clever
It was not intentional, Dave!!! I swear!
Oh Ceci, you made me so laugh! I still haven’t done my true-lie post and I promised. I hope it wouldn’t be to late when I write it down, but I joined this wonderful team of PLN few months ago, so how interested I would be?
sorry about mistake – interested – interesting*- it’s 5 am here in CRO

CEC Alumni Association Holds Annual BBQ
West Caldwell, NJ, Jul 19 - The Community Education Centers' Alumni Association held its annual Alumni BBQ at Merrill Park in Iselin, New Jersey on Saturday July 18th. The day's events started at 10 a.m. and will included activities for children, food, and entertainment.
"Last year's Alumni BBQ saw hundreds of CEC ex-offenders who are now living law-abiding lives return and celebrate their freedom and sobriety. I cannot express what a good feeling it is to see these men and women taking full advantage of their second chances. Our alumni have shed the name 'ex-offender' and are now fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, and are giving back to their communities," said Arthur Townes, Director of the CEC Alumni Association.
The CEC Alumni Association assists offenders in their transition from treatment back into the community through the provision of supportive services as they face the obstacles and difficulties associated with remaining pro-social members of their families and community. The Alumni Association is comprised of former offenders who have successfully completed a CEC program.
The Alumni Association remains very active in the community through local service projects at churches and also speaking engagements with at risk youths. Later in the month, the Wyoming branch of the Alumni Association will hold its annual barbeque in Casper, Wyoming.

Scarlett Johansson quotes
.”
“I never struggled with trying to figure out what it was I wanted to do or what made the sparks go for me. I always had that huge laaa aspect to me.”
“That’s probably the direction I’ll take; I can’t keep up this face forever, you know. There is some weird ageist quality in Hollywood; perhaps that’s why I lean more toward directing and development.”

[Fans only: Hello readers make best movies list of your favorite celebrity and we will be happy to publish your comments. Box office isn't the only criteria. Thank you – Author]
she is the real beauty.
I use to like Scarlett Johansson until watching her interview on 12/13/11 on Entertainment Tonight. While giving the interview Matt Damon walked on the set and she said "Oh J--us Ch--t, here he is now." It's apparent she's just another sewer mouthed low life.
i really love Scarlett.
Scarlett is very beautiful and honest actress toward her work as her film like lost in translation are too cool we really love her for that.
scarlett is vary good in her acting but unfortunatly she is in limited movie. I saw her wonderfull movies but I like her movie 'the Island' she should be in good movies like bruce almighty
Believe me or not, Match Point has been the most wonderful film i v ever seen! plus, Titanic, albeit well-produced, pales in comparison with it! Basically, i m highly interested in Scarlet's inspiring films!
Played adorable role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I can never forget that sacreficing face of her in the movie......

This photo from Halloween shows the Spurs stars pointing toy guns at someone dressed as NBA ref Joey Crawford. There’s not much love lost between the Spurs and Crawford, but this is still shocking. Countdown to an epic fine
Tim Duncan is typically seen as one of the NBA’s good guys. Controversy rarely encircles the legendary forward. That’s about to change. This photo depicting Duncan and teammate Tony Parker pointing toy guns at someone dressed as NBA Ref Joey Crawford at a Halloween party this year surfaced on Reddit.
Didn’t the Spurs used to be a boring team? First they get fined $250,000 a couple of days ago for benching some of their star players. Now this? I’m amazed that the Spurs are now in the gossip rags!

Ketuba mystery – solved!
When it comes to requests for help with family trees, we at are a pretty hard-hearted bunch. We have to be: if we weren’t, we’d finish up spending all our time on other people’s genealogies, leaving none for our core work of finding, transcribing and publishing Jewish community records and, with our other hats on, recording cemeteries for our sister site, So, mostly, we refer such queries to organisations and individuals more dedicated to this kind of work. However, we couldn’t resist a cri-de-coeur from a researcher concerning an unidentified Ketuba, passed to him by his grandmother.
A Ketuba (marriage Contract) is handed to the Bride during the Marriage Ceremony and would remain in her possession throughout her lifetime and be passed to her children on her decease and, thus, remain rather private documents
The Ketuba in question was quite plain and, fortunately, the personal details were easy to decipher. As was to be expected, there were no English Family names on the document and the Hebrew patronymics, Moshe b. Meir and Hannah bat Uri (Aryeh), meant nothing to our correspondent. That is until he looked at the dates on some civil marriage certificates that had, quite fortuitously, arrived by post that very day and, suddenly, the light dawned; the Ketuba belonged to his Great Great Grandmother’s sister, Hannah Emanuel, who married Morris Myers on 17 February 1864.
The matter might have rested there but, in writing to thank us, our correspondent gave us some details of the parents of the Hannah Myers (nee Emanuel), whose Ketuba we had translated, and her sister Sarah, his own Great Great grandmother. They were Philip Emanuel and Abigail Simmons: two names which chimed with some records we had recently been studying.
The couple had married at the Great Synagogue on 1st September 1841
Abigail’s antecedents, Levy Simmon(d)s and Sarah Cohen had been relatively easy to trace. Philip, however, had proved impossibly elusive. And elusive he remains. But something our correspondent spotted concerning the father’s name on Philip’s civil marriage certificate, sent us scurrying back to our SynagogueScribes database [] and over the next week or two we will see if this new line of enquiry leads us out of this genealogical maze, or if we continue to go round in circles, following one false trail after another.

Youth Leadership Initiative
During the 1998 mid-term Congressional elections, national voter turnout was the lowest it had been since 1942. The Center for Politics, founded in part as a reaction to the pervasive apathy and cynicism surrounding politics, recognized an opportunity to combat this lack of interest or engagement by people in their own government by educating primary and secondary students in their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.
The Youth Leadership Initiative (YLI) was established in 1999 as a pilot program with 14 schools in the state of Virginia. It now provides public and private schools in all 50 states and around the world with a comprehensive program of technology-based civics education resources. The academic materials combine lesson plans with civic participation projects so that students can experience directly what it means to live in a representative democracy.
The main components of the YLI program include:
Citizenship Curriculum
Teachers and educators with years of classroom experience developed the YLI citizenship curriculum, which offers dozens of lesson plans tailored to the individual academic standards of each state.
Online Mock Election
Each fall, students vote for real candidates using cyber-ballots that replicate each participating school's voting precinct. Teachers prepare their students with classes on political ideology, campaigns, and voting history in the virtual YLI Classroom, and final election results, broken down by area, are posted on the YLI website.
A More Perfect Union Political Campaign Adventure
Students manage a US Senate campaign in the fictitious state of "Franklin" and try to beat the challenger in strategic media, polling, scheduling and issues tactics that culminate on an Election Day. This CD-based simulation program brings political campaigns and elections to life, and also contains a liberal/conservative political ideology test, a campaign commercial tutorial, and thousands of trivia questions.
E-Congress Legislative Policy-Making Exercise
Students simulate the role of a representative in the US Congress by researching and drafting original legislation, debating its merit in legislative committees and casting a final vote, along with thousands of others, online at the YLI website.
If you are a parent, teacher, student, elected official, or citizen, find out how you can implement YLI in your local schools by contacting us directly (434)243-3538, toll free 1-866-514-8389 or ylihelp@virginia.edu.

I'm french and I have found here recipes to make ceramic pens and pencils that suits me. My problem is : i don't understand the word "trailer" (and therefore : what's the difference with pens ?) I've tried various dictionnaries but i always find : "remorque" (attached to a van) or "bande annonce" (related to movie) which doesn't make sens ! Any idea ? Thank you.

I'm not sure if there is anything thinner than 0.8mm diameter...I don't use the bulb (pear) style slip trailers. I actually prefer to use tips made for cake decorating, and the smallest available is size 000 -- which is about 0.8mm. I looked around online for different sizes, and 0.8mm is the smallest I've seen for sale.
You might be able to get a finer line with a hypodermic needle (see the "inner diameter" column at). I don't know where you might find them in France; here in the US, you can often get them at "farm supply" stores because people need them for livestock....though I'm not sure if you can find one that small!
I'm leaving the sieving question up to someone who knows more about that!

I have used the pencils, I do really like them, after you apply a good clear glaze the colours are nice, the red is red not wine or maroon and the black is black not charcole for example. They are very expensive tho $10 a pencil where I live . . . to save I sharpen them with a knife not a pencile sharpener might not be much of a saving but it makes me feel better. Try buying one or two brite colours and give them a test before making the investment maybe.

At the moment I've made my own pens. I'll tell you wether or not it is satisfying when they will be ready and give the recipe of course! These pens are very expensive in France too ! However I like them very much so I hope my home-made pens will be efficient.

History
CFI Group (formerly Anjoy QSP) was founded in 1988 by Dr. Claes Fornell as an outgrowth of academic research performed by Dr. Fornell at the University of Michigan. As awareness of Dr. Fornell’s groundbreaking research in Customer Satisfaction increased, demand for his consulting services grew as well.
In 1994, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) was launched as a national economic indicator of the quality of goods and services in the U.S. marketplace. It uses survey and modeling technology that relates customer satisfaction to expectations, evaluations of quality, and value. The consequences of customer satisfaction are also measured. For most ACSI companies, these are complaints (or lack thereof) and loyalty (such as propensity to use the product or service again and price tolerance). It is important to point out that the ACSI is much more than the gathering of data on customer satisfaction. It is a comprehensive research and modeling methodology that makes raw data operationally meaningful and (to the extent possible) is purged from random and systematic errors associated with the survey method. To our knowledge, no other customer satisfaction study offers these methodological benefits.
Since Dr. Fornell launched the ACSI in 1994, CFI Group has seen a steady increase in business as more large corporations seek to apply a scientific approach to Customer and Employee Satisfaction as a means of building shareholder value. Much of our new business comes through recommendations from existing clients, attesting to the levels of service and quality provided.
Headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, CFI Group operates several offices on four continents staffed by experienced consultants, research analysts, statisticians, usability auditors, and technical specialists. Since our founding, we have been privileged to work for some of the world’s most prestigious companies. These include British Telecom, Deutsche Bank, GE Capital, H&R Block, The Home Depot, Sears, The ServiceMaster Company, and UPS, to name a few.
CFI Group’s core business is helping clients maximize shareholder value and ROI by optimizing customer satisfaction. Improving financial performance should be the goal of any satisfaction measurement program. We construct measurement programs that give our clients information on how to best grow and strengthen customer relationships to drive financial performance. Supporting and reinforcing a customer-centric culture, these programs lead to demonstrable increases in client enterprise economic value. Such a culture is expressed through changing customer behaviors that increase revenues, reduce costs, lower churn, and/or result in higher customer lifetime value.
In 2008, CFI Group invested in building a breakthrough software technology platform that leveraged the 20 years of experience CFI Group had in delivering customer satisfaction measurement programs using the science developed by Dr Fornell. CFI Group designed this new platform as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that allows clients to better take advantage of the CFI Group methodology in their own operations. The platform helps both line managers and executive management incorporate customer feedback insights into all aspects of their operations to improve business performance.

OPEN COURT
Women of Istanbul Tournament; French Open Winner Li Na; Lobbing Volleys With Andrea Petkovic; WTA Chairman and CEO Stacey Allaster; Turkish Star Ipek Senoglu Determined to Put Turkey on Tennis Map; Andrea Petkovic Behind the Scenes
Aired November 10, 2011 - 05:30 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
PAT CASH, HOST: Hello, and welcome to OPEN COURT. Just beyond these ships is the Asian continent. I'm in Istanbul where East meets West and the top women tennis players have all traveled here for a year-ending championship. So, why Istanbul? Well, it's one of several markets that women's tennis is hoping to conquer. Coming up on OPEN COURT, Li Na, Asia's first ever Grand Slam champion talks about life after her big win. Hear why her husband is back in her coaching corner. Plus, what does it take to run the WTA? The woman at the center of the organization gives us rare access. And still to come, Andrea Petkovic dusts off her dancing shoes. The tournament only sends out eight invitations, and I was lucky enough to catch up with some of the top players and ask them what their highlights of the year were. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (CROWD CHEERS) CASH: And how have the last few months been since Wimbledon? Has it been a bit -- a bit crazy? PETRA KVITOVA, WIMBLEDON CHAMPION: When I'm playing some tournament, yes, other people came to me and know my name finally, because before it was like, thank God, or something like that. CASH: Twenty-four years ago, I won Wimbledon, and I had dinner with Martina Navratilova. It's been -- there's not that many Czech players have been winning since. Welcome to the club. You're now a member of the All England Lawn Tennis Club. KVITOVA: It's very nice to be with Martina and Jana and Jan Kodes and everybody who won this great game. (CROWD CHEERS) CASH: So, tell me, how's it been since the US Open? SAMANTHA STOSUR, US OPEN CHAMPION: I went back to the Gold Coast, and the Gold Coast actually put on a big parade for me and also the 100 meters champ, Sally Pearson. So we did a bit of a parade, and lots of people came out, we got the keys to the city. CASH: Yes, I got the keys to Melbourne, and I realized -- the key to Melbourne -- and I realized it didn't open anything. STOSUR: That's exactly right. There's nothing. CASH: Huh? What's the deal? I couldn't go into any jewelry stores - - STOSUR: I heard lots of rumors of what it does, and then once I got there, they said, no, it does nothing. So -- but I guess it's just a great honor. CASH: Is there anything in particular you think that might have stood out for this year? STOSUR: Oh, I think there's been some really huge milestones this year. Really interesting that you can have those major events and throughout the year have four different winners, four winners in really quite different stages of their careers. (CROWD CHEERS) STOSUR: Kim and Li Na, what she's been through, having a child, and now winning another Slam. (CROWD CHEERS) VICTORIA AZARENKA, WORLD NUMBER THREE: I think quite a lot happened this year, but the one that really stands out is Li Na winning the French Open. It was an historical moment for China and for women's tennis as well, it was really huge. And I was the unfortunate one to lose to her in the quarterfinals, but I think it was amazing. CAROLINE WOZNIACKI, WORLD NUMBER ONE: I think it's great that Li Na won in the French Open and China, it's a huge market, and she's become very big in China and tennis has become very popular there. (END VIDEOTAPE) CASH: Li Na's win at the French Open is something that I won't soon forget. I mean, 116 million people cheering her on, watching her lift the Roland Garros trophy. We were fortunate enough to catch up with her at a Chinese Premier event in Beijing. Here's Eunice Yoon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER: Li Na! 2011 French Open Champion, Li Na! (CROWD CHEERS) EUNICE YOON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is a rare trip home for China's first ever Grand Slam champion. I wanted to find out how she's adapted to her newly-found fame. (CROWD CHEERS) YOON (on camera): That means we're starting. LI NA, FRENCH OPEN CHAMPION: OK. OK. YOON: So, how has life changed for you since the French Open? LI: I think it changed a lot. Really. I mean -- biggest I know after the French Open is I come back to China. The fans were crazy. (CROWD CHEERS) LI: I was back home and the lady was like, "Oh, Li Na, I know who you are, I need your autograph." I was like -- because she spoke so loud so everyone can hear that. And same time, more people just came around for me, so my friend said, "Run into the car! Run into the car!" So, I was full power running to the car, and then we shoot. So, I was like, "What happened?" It was just like no more life. (CROWD CHEERS) YOON: Why did you decide to go into tennis? LI: My father was a badminton player and had some problems so he couldn't continue. So that's why, I was playing badminton before. But after two years, the tennis coach came to the badminton court, take me to the tennis court to show me how was the tennis court, how was the racket, how was the ball. And I was -- because I was so young. I couldn't decide anything, so I asked my family. So, they came to the court, they say, "Oh, interesting. OK. We change." I was like, "This is what you decide, one second after you see the court?" And I think it's not bad that I changed. (LAUGHTER) YOON (voice-over): As a young schoolgirl, Li Na trained under the state-funded national team, which covers all of the players costs. BENDOU ZHANG, TENNIS JOURNALIST: The state assists and you don't have lots of options. You train with other girls, you have the same coach, they use the same ways to coach everybody. YOON: Following the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Tennis Association gave more freedom to its players. ZHANG: Now everybody has to personalize their coaching way. You can choose which tournaments you play in and which coach you work with. I think it's very good for her. YOON: Li Na picked the former Swedish pro Thomas Hogstedt to help move her career forward. THOMAS HOGSTEDT, FORMER COACH, 2005-2010: She had very, very big potential. She was strong, she had great technique and strokes. She needed to have a mind how to play. I think that's what I tried to help the whole China players was the mentality, to believe that you can beat. Also the top ten players have weaknesses, so everything is possible. LI: Thomas, he was magnificent China coach. He always gave me the confidence. First time, he would say, "Oh, for sure you can be top 20. I was like, "Are you joking?" Because I didn't believe -- never had the coach say I can be top 20. ZHANG: I think Chinese people like her because she's different. She's not very Chinese. She's very international. She talks and communicates with people in some kind of other ways. YOON (on camera): You're viewed here as a rebel or a maverick. LI: No, I'm not. YOON: Yes you are! LI: No. YOON: Are you comfortable with that image? LI: Definitely not. YOON: Why not? LI: I mean, I never thought I was special. I'm just a tennis player. I just do my job. So, I don't know why someone would say that. YOON (voice-over): Li Na began the year with her husband as her coach. She fired him in the spring and rehired him in the fall. LI: Really, it's tough. Husband is the coach, so sometimes he was shouting against me, I was like, "Hey, you are my husband, why are you shouting against me?" But I forgot he was my coach. ZHANG: Jiang Shan is like her rubbish can. She needs a channel to make all the negative emotion go out, and Jiang Shan does a very good job, I think. YOON (on camera): Who proposed to whom when you guys decided to get married? LI: This is tough. I mean, we don't know who said it first, because we'd been together 13 years already. Just feeling like, "Should we marry?" "Yes. OK." And the next day we just go, OK. YOON: Because there was a report about how you had proposed on Valentine's Day. LI: No, of course not. We students have parties. So we have to wait after he retire if student husband. (LAUGHTER) (END VIDEOTAPE) CASH: Well, I've got a very special guest here. ANDREA PETKOVIC, WORLD NUMBER 10: Hello. CASH: Andrea Petkovic. PETKOVIC: How are you? CASH: Hello, very nice to meet you. PETKOVIC: Nice to meet you, Pat. CASH: What do you think about Li Na? That was a pretty impressive year, wasn't it? PETKOVIC: That was so impressive. CASH: Something -- PETOVIC: It was really -- CASH: -- something special. PETOVIC: It was really special because I also -- I played in China now this year, and I felt that the spirit changed there. It was just, people got so much more into tennis and they really knew what was going on, and I think Li Na changed that. CASH: She's not the only one who's done well, is she? You've done amazingly well. Where was your ranking before this year? Because you -- PETKOVIC: Yes, I was -- CASH: -- we didn't know you before last year. And now, here you are. PETKOVIC: I played well, yes. I had a great season. I played quite consistent. I played three quarters and three Grand Slams. So, now I'm here, I'm top 10. CASH: So, you've gone from 13 to 10. Where do you think you can improve to get up to maybe top 5? PETKOVIC: I would like to have more variety in my game. I would like to come more to the net, you know? Like you did in earlier times I heard. And I would like to improve my serve, so there are still tons of things that I need to improve. CASH: Well, if you want to practice some volleys. You want to practice some volleys? PETKOVIC: Yes, let's do it. CASH: Yes? PETKOVIC: Yes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CASH: And you seem to have a lot of fun on the tour. PETKOVIC: Yes. I'll try to enjoy myself as much as I can. CASH: Sorry. Sorry about that. PETKOVIC: Want to kill me? CASH: I didn't mean that to happen. Everybody's talking about your dancing skills. PETKOVIC: Oh yes? CASH: Yes. PETKOVIC: Do you have some dancing skill? CASH: I have no dancing skills. PETKOVIC: I don't believe that. CASH: I actually woke up in the middle of the night, I want, "Oh! Heidi's going to make me dance!" (LAUGHTER) CASH: And I'm horrified by dancing. PETROVIC: If I play semis in Australia, you have to dance with me. CASH: Where? Not -- on center court? PETROVIC: On center court, yes. CASH: Or in a night club? Different -- PETROVIC: Right after my match. CASH: Well, Andrea, thank you very much. PETROVIC: Thank you so much, Pat. It was a lot of fun. CASH: Yes, and I've got a little -- a little favor to ask. PETROVIC: Oh, OK. CASH: You mind doing some behind the scenes footage for us? PETROVIC: No, I don't mind at all. CASH: Yes? There you go. (END VIDEOTAPE) CASH: Still to come, an inside look at what it takes to run the WTA. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STOSUR: Funny, I've actually never been to this city or country before, so it's not too many places that are new each year. VERA ZVONAREVA, WORLD NUMBER SEVEN: Turkey is a great country, and I think they're paying a lot of attention to the sport. WOZNIACKI: We really didn't know what to expect, and now I feel like there's so much buzz about this city. (END VIDEO CLIP) CASH: Welcome back to Istanbul, the site of the WTA season-ending championships. The lady behind this elite event, none other than WTA chairman and CEO, Stacey Allaster. In 2010, "Forbes" magazine named her one of the most powerful women in sports. OPEN COURT was granted rare access to follow Allaster over a 48- hour period at the Rogers Cup. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CANDY REID, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Stacey. I've come to -- CASH (voice-over): CNN's Candy Reid caught up with her in her native Toronto. STACEY ALLASTER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, WTA: When you think about it, my first job in tennis was cleaning the red clay courts at my club. REID: Is that right? ALLASTER: For 24 cents, or to get a pop. And then to think that I am the head of the organization that Billie Jean King founded. You know, I can sit her today and tell you that our sponsorship revenues are 60 percent up, six new sponsors, we've added three or four new events. I sat with the top players three days ago and said, all right, we're in a worldwide recession, and your prize money in the last three years has gone from $85 million to $90 million and $96 million next year. So, from this, this is really today's meeting. Almost 40 percent comes from our year-end championship. KIM CLIJSTERS , WORLD NUMBER 13: She is a competitor in her business, and that's, I think, what has been very -- why she's been so successful is that, OK, we have a good product, but you also need a good leader, and she's been that leader that we've been looking for for many years. ALLASTER: This is their business. I work for them. And they're the stars of the show. The last one will be on Saturday -- DANIELA HANTUCHOVA, WORLD NUMBER 24: She's the strength to represent the players, that we are not only on the court to look good and to be part of the tournament, but every one of us wants to win it. REID (voice-over): Of course, the big factor in the WTA's recent success is the emergence of a genuine superstar from China, French Open champion Li Na. ALLASTER: Li Na has really kicked it and taken us to a whole other level, 116 million fans watched Li Na win her first Grand Slam. Just the scale and size of that market is immense for women's tennis. China and Asia-Pacific is our number one priority. We want to make sure that we get that -- those markets right. REID (on camera): Do you see good life after the likes of Venus, Serena, Kim, Maria Sharapova, once they retire? ALLASTER: Everyone says, who's next? Everyone says, is it going to be as good as Monica and Steffi? And Chrissy and Martina. And what do we know? It always is. How are you? PETKOVIC: I'm good. You? ALLASTER: I think you missed. And that's where we went to. PETKOVIC: I know. ALLASTER: What are we going to do? REID: How important is it to develop the personalities of the players? Because there's a lot of Eastern European players that people just don't know. ALLASTER: How do we make Andrea Petkovic a star in North America? The great news is, she's got a wonderful personality. You know this is my home tournament, right? PETKOVIC: I know, I know that you're Canadian. (LAUGHTER) PETKOVIC (imitating Canadian accent): I figured it out. ALLASTER: Oh! (LAUGHTER) ALLASTER: You met me! When we go to Europe, Andrea Petkovic is a superstar. So, that's where we have this strength of being global, but it also can be a challenge as we move the tour around. REID: What about the grunting issue? Because that came up at Wimbledon a bit. ALLASTER: It does. REID: People were worrying a bit about -- ALLASTER: I don't know, you Brits. It always comes up when we're at Wimbledon. REID: It's a problem with Sharapova and Azarenka, if they were to play together under the roof at Wimbledon. ALLASTER: Yes. I do believe that changing this generation is very hard. They have trained this way. It's how they learned to play the sport. REID: I only have $10. $20. Am I going to go and see a movie, am I going to go and see a tennis match? ALLASTER: You can go to a movie any day of the year, but for seven days in your city, you can only see world class tennis. So, take a chance, come and see a Monday afternoon first round match of women's tennis, and you will be blown away. You cannot believe how talented they are, how hard they hit the ball, and it's a great entertainment outing. (END VIDEOTAPE) CASH: Still to come, the woman who's determined to put tennis on the map in Turkey. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CASH: Welcome back to OPEN COURT from Istanbul. One of Turkey's most successful tennis players, and she's leading the charge for tennis in her country. I joined her for a cup of tea, Ipek Senoglu. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CASH: Oh, look at this. Well done, Ipek. Tea, the traditional stuff. IPEK SENOGLU, FORMER TURKISH NUMBER ONE: Did you like what I ordered? CASH: Fantastic. The cafe. Here we are. Thanks for tea. Now, you've got the distinction of being the first Turkish player to ever play in a Grand Slam. Wimbledon, right? SENOGLU: Yes. CASH: I've known you for a years, so I knew you when you were trying to get into -- SENOGLU: Yes. CASH: -- the tournament. Must've been a big step up. SENOGLU: It was always a dream for me, but obviously, being the first Turkish and having to dream about it a few years back before I did it, people were actually laughing because no one had done it before. But obviously, reaching that goal for me to ever play in a Grand Slam meant a lot. CASH: Well, when I first came here a few years ago, probably about the same time as you were trying to come through -- SENOGLU: Yes. Yes. CASH: I could -- I saw the potential. I saw so many kids that were playing tennis, and I thought, wow, people really do like playing tennis here. SENOGLU: Yes. CASH: It's come a long way. SENOGLU: A player doesn't have to right now go outside of Turkey to play professional tennis. CASH: Now, you also were -- what we famously saw a beautiful picture of, you and Venus Williams playing on a bridge in between -- SENOGLU: Yes, Bosporus Bridge, yes. CASH: -- Europe and Asia. SENOGLU: Yes. CASH: And you stopped -- you managed to stop all the traffic, obviously. SENOGLU: Yes, we did. (CROSSTALK) CASH: That in itself is almost impossible. SENOGLU: On one side of the bridge -- on one side of the bridge, they actually stopped the traffic. They asked me, look, you guys are going to be the first two people that ever had -- can play tennis from Asia to Europe. Would you like to do that? I was like, "Yes, please!" I liked to do that. It was an amazing experience to be on that bridge and to toss the ball literally with Venus Williams, one of the best players in the world. And to actually write history, because I don't think anybody will ever do that again. CASH: You're doing a tennis show this week. You're still on the circuit. SENOGLU: Yes. CASH: You're doing a lot of stuff. You're doing a tennis academy. SENOGLU: Yes. CASH: Who are some of the players that you think -- that you enjoy interviewing and -- SENOGLU: One of the girls that I enjoyed interviewing with was Andrea because she's very outgoing and -- CASH: Petkovic? SENOGLU: Yes. Do you like her? CASH: She's a lot of fun. She actually did a video blog for us, so, a behind-the-scenes video blog. So, maybe we'll have a little look at that. Let's have a look. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETKOVIC: It's crazy. It's crazy, it's crazy. Once it's like water, it goes crazy. I feel like I'm the Backstreet Boys. Look at this guy. JOHN ISNER: Look at my chest! PETKOVIC: He just played the match. How did it go, four sets? ISNER: I won in four. Look at my big chest. PETKOVIC: Yes, look at his chest. ISNER: Am I turning you on. PETKOVIC: A little bit. (LAUGHTER) PETKOVIC: I hope you like this, and make sure you stay tuned. Caio. (END VIDEOTAPE) CASH: Well, you see Andrea is a lot of fun. But -- SENOGLU: Yes. I told you. CASH: Yes. Thanks very much for looking after us and getting this feast. I think it's -- SENOGLU: Can I eat some now? CASH: I think it's time to leave. But first of all, we're just going to say good-bye to everybody from Istanbul and thanks very much for watching this month. Food time. END

Books.
Nice thing is that despite my son loving it, (the) main character is very strong female character, so girls will love her struggles as boys latch onto action and cool gadgets and brother character.
This is the best middle grade book I’ve read in a while. I loved it.
Fans of fantasy and adventure are sure to love this book just as much as I did. Download or buy a copy (preferably from a brick-and-mortar store) in March – you won’t regret it! The book is also a clever history lesson. Morris does a great job of describing the historic events as Abby and Derick review them, making it feel as if the reader is right beside them as they watch history.
A fantastical futuristic read that should engage kids and families.

The percentage of unemployed workers in DeKalb County has hovered around 10 percent for the last several months, and local officials believe that number could slightly worsen before it improves.
The county’s unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in January 2009 as the state and local economies plunged deeper into a recession. The rate increased to 10.8 percent in July – its apogee – and has hovered within that area in the months since.
Statewide, better news may not be on the horizon either.
“By far, this has been the worst in job loss the county has experienced in decades, far exceeding what we experienced in September 2001,” said Andrea Walton, a county spokeswoman. “As DeKalb works feverishly to climb out of this depressed job market, economic forecasters have predicted that DeKalb along with the rest of Georgia will lag behind well into 2011 due to the worsening of construction and the commercial real estate markets.”
The number of unemployed workers in DeKalb County has risen from 32,547 in January 2009 to 40,296 in October, according to state Department of Labor data. The county’s workforce has also shrunk from 387,282 in January to 382,137 in October because a significant portion of the workforce has left the county, according to Ralph Tower, a state labor market analyst.
The state’s unemployment rate could hit 11 percent by mid-2010 with more than six job seekers for each open position, Walton said. State banks are over-invested in the development market, she said, and, consequently, DeKalb County and the rest of the state will likely lag behind into 2011.
To lessen continued job losses, the county has funneled money into DeKalb Workforce Development, a county agency, to protect and generate new jobs, she said. The agency received about $4.9 million to create or save more than 2,000 jobs in the county – part of President Barack Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a direct response to the recession.
The county also employed about 1,100 youth to work in a summer employment program. Many youth went on to receive full-time, permanent employment, Walton said. The agency determined in-demand industries that could lead to re-employment in a short amount of time, including health care, energy, green industries, education and infrastructure. County CEO Burrell Ellis held a jobs creation forum Dec. 18 to identify job creation opportunities.
“The light at the end of the tunnel is that many think, and I agree, that DeKalb has weathered the greatest impact of job losses as we move to focus on job creation,” Walton said.

Good!!
Always eager to learn from the best. I'm definitely looking forward to watching Bjarne's interesting talk and the other GoingNative 2012 sessions!
Looking forward to this exciting session, Rocks!!
Looking forward to all the sessions. I am based in Manchester UK, must have checked the time in Redmond USA at least 20 times today :) cant wait.
We are gonna party like it is C++98 :P
Where are the live feed links?
Awesome talk!
Where can I access the recorded keynote?
You'll be able to access the recorded keynote and indeed all the sessions right here. Charles said it would take about +1 day to do the encoding and then the downloadable video files will be available.
Where can I download yesterday videos?
It was a great lecture!
But I haven't had the time to watch other speakers. I'll download the 1080p version of talks, since 1080p makes reading the code much a nicer experience.
EDIT: Charles, would it be possible to also publish the PowerPoint or PDF slides?
@undefined:Yes, where are the recorded sessions?
Had to work during almost all talks, so I'm looking forward to here all these presentations - saw a bit of the first day live but will enjoy the recordings of all presentations soon
. BTW: great selection of speakers: Bjarne, Sutter, Alexandrescu,…
@STL: great to here that range-base-for-loops will be in VC11.. though I'm a std::for_each-guy so that's not that big of a deal for me.
PS: looking forward to std::thread-support in VC…
The range-based for-loop is significantly less verbose than std::for_each() (my least favorite STL algorithm).
But using more specific STL algorithms is always a good idea.
The first qsort Example seems to be broken. I guess it goes to show how bad the API really is.
void f(char *arr, int m, ...) {
qsort(arr, m, sizeof(char*), cmpstringp);
}
He probably wanted a char *arr[].
Great talk so far.
btw. this website should support Unicode in names!
Thanks. Fixed for future uses.
A great talk!
I believe the 38 slide should read
shared_ptr<Gadget> p( new Gadget{n} );
instead of
shared_ptr<Gadget> p = new Gadget{n};
The same thing with the 39 slide.
I thought the talk on C++11 was great.
helpful
Can someone enlighten me about the syntax on page 62 (and 63) of slides:
double* f(const vector<double>& v); // read from v return result
double* g(const vector<double>& v); // read from v return result
void user(const vector<double>& some_vec) // note: const
{
double res1, res2;
thread t1 {[&]{ res1 = f(some_vec); }};
thread t2 {[&]{ res2 = g(some_vec); }};
// ...
t1.join();
t2.join();
cout << res1 << ' ' << res2 << '\n';
}
Isn't there a type mismatch between f() return and res1?
I took some sentence from the description of Bjarne description, because I am trying to find ressources, materials tutorials that show how to acheive this. For the previous standart or c++11. Anybody know good reference where i can find this now?
thanks
@undefined: Slides will be released with each session video! Like this one
C
Oh heck I give up.
Cool. Now we can see the invisible graph.
Yes, having to explain an invisible graph was a bit of a challenge :-)
Thanks for the comments; corrections will be applied to future versions of the talk.
It is interesting to ask if the software which supposed to show the graphs and the graph itself (i.e. invisible one) was written in C++. I noticed also some problems with fonts on one or two slides.
According to my experience these are typical problems in all kind of scientific presentations.
It is hard to believe that it is so difficult to avoid those problems with current technology. The same presentation on one computer looks very different on a different computer only because some other fonts are installed on that computer. In theory it is possible to embed the fonts with the presentation unfortunately this method do not work well in many cases (my own experience).
The only real solution is to transform the presentation into pdf or use some other software (or use your own computer but in many cases is not possible).
I saw these problems hundreds times in all kind of conferences and it looks like nobody in the MS Office Team cares about that (since the existence of MS Office).
The question about an easier way to declare getters and setters, anyone else think than Bjarne was just short of saying "I don't want that crap in my language"? =)
Nice. C++ may get bashed a lot, but its creator can certainly deliver a coherent presentation.() );
Shouldn't there at least be a performance difference between
sum=0; for(vector<int>::sizetype i=0;i<v.size();++i){ sum+=v[i]};
sum=0; for_each(v.begin(),v.end(),[&sum](int x){sum +=x;});
Since the first is calling size() during each loop, while the second (I believe) wouldn't constantly be rechecking the size, similarly to defining a vector<int>::sizetype end=v.size; and checking i<end?
I am also curious why there aren't at least some run times or something to back up the claim that there is no discernible difference between "several systems and several compilers"?
On my question about getters and setters in the video, I guess that these should be avoided; public data and object members should simply be declared public, despite what I've seen to be a common practice on many projects, and which seems to be promoted in many object oriented languages.
Ideally, there would be some way to overload the setting of an object or data "property" if the logic needs to be changed or limits imposed. I have created a Property template class in the past as Bjarne suggested, however, there is no elegant way for the parent class to overload the setter in the aggregated Property<T> member, and the syntax of accessing members of the property too often become property.get().member(), rather than property.member(), which is what you want to write.
From a language viewpoint, perhaps something like an overloaded "member access operator" would allow library writers to implement a setter or getter later if needed without changing user code. But without this, we suggest that if we need to change logic around setting or getting a member value, make the property private and recompile - we can easily find and update all the usages of the data member to use the new getter or setter.
So awesome to have Bjarne posting on C9!
Thank you, sir.
C
@undefined:Darren, here are my thoughts on your question. If you created a wrapper class for each public data member you could overload the assignment operator to perform bounds checking (as well as assignment) and perhaps throw an exception if necessary. That would solve the problem of assigning to a property without a setter. Of course, you would also have to overload all other meaningful operators for that property such as the boolean operators. You would have to repeat all this for each property, which in the end may be more trouble than it's worth. I can't really think of another way to do it, but I also haven't touched C++ in awhile so I could be wrong. Anyway, good luck.
I would really love to hear a talk, or read a paper, from Bjarne that discusses when to use OOP, and when to choose Functional or Type programming. For me, finding a balance has always been the most difficult part in software development. There just isn't one right way, but I'd love to hear his thoughts.
If anyone has any links to anything related that would be wonderful.
Nice
For those who are also members of the C++ Software Developers group on LinkedIn, I have started a discussion about what I believe are the most important features of C++ 11, and would love to see feedback and examples of good style that people would like to contribute. See
I watched the video few times.
I feel like we need some "fresh-minds" in defining what programming should look like, replacing Bjarne.
They had their era, time to move on.
My biggest problem with C++ (in big project) are the #includes that square the amount of source to compile (headers are compiled separately for each compilation unit).
Look how long it takes to compile firefox or KDE :-(
I think this is were we pay the cost for [over]using templates and/or inline functions.
Maybe there is something that could be fixed here? Maybe if we break backward compatibility (drop the preprocessor)? It's a pity that those problems were not mentioned here.
@pafinde: That's one of the things that modules seek to solve.
You can see the "invisible" graph in my posted slides.
I wrote a paper for IEEE Computer Magazine with very similar examples. See the January 2012 issue of Computer or my publications page:.
From C++ application development point of view, is there any place for compiler generated iterators in C++ (c# IEnumerable)? Seems like they may be implemented with zero overhead, like lambdas do.
I dont see any difference between the example
and the 'better' example
Both are understandable only if you use declarative parameter names as it is done with
which is equally understandable for me if you write
?
@bog: Thanks for this detailed answer to my comment.
I dont want to start nit-picking here. For sure 99.9999% of all programmers (me included) would use both corner points to define a rectangle. But you could also define it by its center point and any other point.
Or using the second constructor with Point top_left and Box_hw. Even if i would be 99% sure that i know what's meant, if i would readI would take a look at the implementation or read the docs to be sure.
So for me, using declarative parameter names highly improves the readability of interfaces.
After a night thinking about this issue I have to correct my first comment.
Within the meaning of this excellent talk, the examples using Point are the better ones. I was just misled by the different notations for good examples written with parameters and bad examples written without.
The Point example is better, because it implicates the possibility to use units like it is done by the Speed example.
The general point (sic) about the Point example is that sequences of arguments of the same type is prone to transposition of argument values. I consider it a well established fact that this is a significant source of errors. The implication is that we need to look for remedies. Using a more expressive and specific set of types is one approach.
A very good source of infomation..
Bjarne sir, I truly enjoyed, appreciated, and was influenced by your presentation. One thing that comes to mind is the ability for C++ to write performant, yet secure code.
I'm confused at one thing.
I can understand where he says, shared_ptr and unique_ptr,
but where he says why use a pointer, and then shows this code:
I'm pretty sure C++ wouldn't except that?
I've just run a test, and you can scope a variable like in Java now ^_^
it would be like this
Its amazing to see how C++ is catching up with .NET.
I've always been a C++ guy.
Thanks again.
Now? That last f() has worked for about two decades! It's pure C++98.
The "Gadget g {n};" in the original example, simply used the C++11 uniform initializer syntax, but is otherwise identical.
Wow, i must be honoured to get a reply from the man himself.
Thanks for the heads up Bjarne, C++ is really moving up.
So I can just pass a object by value by using rvalue references.
That is soo cool.

So, why can’t I read an unsigned char from an input stream?
When I try to read from "0", I get 060 and not 0 as expected.
And when I push (unsigned char) 0, I get "\0", not "0" in the output.
(1) Huh? unsigned char c; while(cin>>c) cout<<c<<'\n'; gives exactly what I expect
(2) The value of (unsigned char)0 *is* 0; not the value of the character '0'
Great presentation Bjarne. Honestly I have checked it a few times already
on the expense of not having watched the other videocasts yet...
Too bad the Vector vs Linked-List comparison kind of fell short. In spite of the graph-mishap I got inspired and tested it on a few different machines. For small amounts it was virtually the same but as the sets got larger there was a huge difference.It was fun to see - especially since I remember discussing this a couple of years ago (then I failed to see the larger picture).
Thanks again for the presentation!
To the guy asking about getters and setters using different get and set functions per class and while still keeping function inlining, this should work.
template<class OutType, class StoreType, class Controller>
class Property
{
private:
StoreType data;
public:
operator OutType()
{
return Controller::get(data);
}
OutType operator=(OutType a)
{
Controller::set(data, a);
return Controller::get(data);
}
};
class HPController
{
public:
static int get(int &a)
{
return a;
}
static void set(int &a, int &b)
{
a = b;
}
};
class Man
{
public:
Property<int, int, HPController> HP;
};
void PropertyTest()
{
Man man;
man.HP = 7;
cout << man.HP << "\n";
}
Thanks Bjarne!!!
I knew I wasn't stupid for wanting readable interfaces!! Hehe
@Ray: The problem with that approach becomes when your 'controller' needs to do something a bit more complex and needs the target object's state to decide what to do or needs to notify the target object to do something else upon a change.
In my experience I've found those cases the primary cases where I actually needed getters and setters.
So then in that case the Property class template needs to change to be able to contain a controller object which then holds a reference to the target object ( 'Man', in this case ), and the Controller then can not use static methods.
But then here is the bloat added.
So I like Darren's new proposal best - if they are logically publically available properties just leave them as public member variables.
In the future, when you realize that you need something more complex, either make them private and add getters and setters and modify the client code, or make a decorator that allows the assignment operator to work with them which calls the real getters and setter behind the scenes.
The truth is IOStream treats signed/unsigned chars as characters and not as numbers. Whether this is something to be expected I don't know.
Didn't know I could watch this on the internet.
I will definitely watch this as soon as I get off.
My suggestion is that when you write a char (short for "character") to an character I/O stream, you should expect to see that character on the output device. It takes quite some alternative learning to expect otherwise.
PS The "c" in cout, stands for "character"
PPS "If everything else fails read the manual"
I was trying to use his units code that was on the slide around 24:00, but the syntax he uses for the following doesn't seem to work with gcc 4.6.2 and -std=c++0x
using Speed = Value<Unit<1,0,-1>>;
I've never seen this use of the using directive before. Anybody know what is up with this?
@Luke: gcc 4.7 introduces support for template aliases. I have only 4.6.1 installed... I'll need to upgrade I guess
With gcc 4.7, the following works:
Speed sp1 = Value<Unit<1,0,-1>>(100); // 100 meters / second
But this does not (operator/ is not defined):
Speed sp1 = Value<Unit<1,0,0>>(100) / Value<Unit<0,0,1>>(1);
I guess he left out the part which would define all the arithmetic operators.
Yes, about two pages of things like this
template<class U1, class U2>
Value<typename Unit_plus<U1,U2>::type>
operator*(Value<U1> x, Value<U2> y)
{
return Value<typename Unit_plus<U1,U2>::type>(x.val*y.val);
}
and this
template<class U1, class U2>
struct Unit_plus {
typedef Unit<U1::m+U2::m,
U1::kg+U2::kg,
U1::s+U2::s
> type;
};
You can make that prettier in C++11, but I was using an old compiler (then), so I used old-fashioned, but effective, metaprogramming.
I like this one.
!bind comes from boost.
"Using !bind(pred, _1) in the first call to stable_partition() in the definition of the gather() function template (around minute 56 of the video) won't compile, will it? (Unless the wrapper object returned from bind() overloads operator!, which I don't think it does.)"
- from decades, code was been easy to learn first, because you were just need a few terms for programming. And you were done all things with that.
- Now, you need , you must use Interfaces , typedef specifics, classes globally existing in a namespace (like .NET) and you must know how you name it.
Yes, a box it's ok . This is a simple box. But, Box_hw ? how do you spell it ? You need now what you want to do but name it !
Is it more difficult for programmers ? No . Is it more difficult to remember the names ? No
It it always difficult to remember for beginners. But, if you are a beginner, engineer, you just need to remember all classes. For example, even google couldn't help you if you want a bicycle and you don't know how you spell a bicycle.
Now, differences between engineers : a few people know all classes ? well, but it's not very realistic.
Second, i love when i can be a C++ programmer since i know how to program in Java. That is in a good spirit.
Third, i love when he said "who does the delete ?" . Many bugs come from the bad documentation or a left program.
And else about Copy ? Not copy ? well, you can choice. You need to choice and need to say in the documentation that you can copy or not (thread safe ?).
After, it explains you should have use a Vector and not a List to insert incrementally your data because true OO type is a chained list. That is the difference and a time consuming with .NET List insertion. But, it's implementation dependent. You should know the implementation now.
Low level is should be not use : use standard templates instead. That's very C++ !

Best Kataang Moments (The Promise & The Search)
YES
Sokka’s face. lolz.
I didn’t really feel this was a spoiler, but if you think so, I’m sorry?
But seriously look how adorable they are.
Since when were Kataang shippers ever throwing more of a hissy fit about Zuko then some adorable kisses?

Look at my OTP. Look how beautiful it is.
Small penguin-sledding gifset. I had two more but tumblr won’t let me upload them.
Question to other gifmakers: How do you get good quality gifs in small file sizes?
Aang levitates in the air, until suddenly, a bolt of lightning strikes his body. The swirling cosmic ball vanishes and the avatar spirit falls and fades away along with the path of light Aang is standing on. Aang’s body plummets to the earth below. Back in the physical world, Aang’s body is also falling to the ground. His clothes are charred, and there is a terrible wound on his back where he was struck, as well as a burnt spot on the sole of his foot where the lightning exited. Katara stares shocked and horrified, tears rolling down her face. She turns her body and swirls the water around her. Katara creates a large wave and rides on top of it towards Aang, arms spread behind her. The wave rolls over Zuko and the Dai Li, washing them away. Katara catches Aang and lands on the ground, the water flowing away from her. She holds his unconscious body and looks up hopelessly...
Imagine person A of your OTP a ghost singing a lullaby to person B every night.
:(
THIS IS NOT OKAY
Because this is what actually probably happens every day after Aang dies ;__;
i can’t promise you that i will be the only one around
when your hope falls down
but we’re young
open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
My OTP is so beautiful! <3
and if i try to get close, he is already gone
Ahh the way they look at each other! <3
I was never active on those forums, but whenever I went on there it was always a nightmare. I was personally insulted. I saw anti-Semitic remarks. People were horrible in general. I could never understand how a forum dedicated to my perfect OTP could draw such nasty people.
Good riddance, I say.

Archie Comics
I turn my back on a woman for 50 years, and this is what happens. Veronica Lodge has agreed to marry Archie Andrews. I will admit that Archie has aged a lot better than I have, although he’s 10 months older, but I still consider this the height of perfidy.
The news has been out for a long time, but the comic book containing the engagement story arrived on news stands today — or so I’m told. I didn’t have the heart to look.
Meanwhile, the news today that Disney is going to buy Marvel Entertainment — Spider Man, Captain America and all — got me to thinking about the other comics I read, when I wasn’t fawning over Veronica.
My pantheon was Plastic Man, Blackhawk, the Green Lantern, Superman and Batman. Plastic Man had one of the most complicated personal histories of any comicbook hero. I don’t want to go into it here (I do have to teach the first class of the semester tomorrow morning) but one aspect of it is reminiscent of the Toxic Avenger, now an off-Broadway attraction, thanks to the George Street Playhouse. Toxie, to his intimates, was a nerd who was thrown into a vat of toxic chemical waste that turned him into a superhuman mutant. Plastic Man was an underworld figure who was accidentally sprayed with a chemical that made his body so flexible that he could bend himself into any shape, though he retained the red color and black-and-yellow stripes of his body suit. I remember him, for instance, disguising himself as an icicle, but even as a kid I didn’t understand why his pursuers couldn’t spot an icicle with that color scheme.
I don’t know whether this Disney transaction is good or bad, but I did read an analysis of the financial aspects of the engagement of Archie and Veronica. Roma Luciw, writing in The Globe and Mail, examined whether a couple with such disparate underpinnings — a wealthy she and a middle-class he — should enter into a prenuptial agreement. You can read what the experts think at this link:
<|endofexample|>
The financial regulation bill that House-Senate negotiators have finally cobbled together, with ringside support from the White House, is farcical in its failure to learn relevant lessons from 2007-2009 U.S. experience. The bill simply increases the regulatory authority of all government agencies responsible for that crisis, while leaving untouched the unsavory criminals and fraudsters, private and public, responsible for the collapse of financial markets.
The Federal Reserve, which actively promoted the housing bubble and failed utterly to monitor the major banks, is to gain yet more authority to regulate yet more financial institutions. The Treasury, which bailed out some institutions and refused to bail out others, without rhyme or reason to its decisions, is to control a new Financial Stability Oversight Council empowered arbitrarily to determine which companies pose ‘systemic risk’. Rest assured that Goldman Sachs will never be so identified by any Sec. Treas. confirned into office. The Securities Exchange Commission, which created the credit ratings oligopoly and failed completely to identify any of the major scam artists that thrived under its loose jurisdiction, is to have additional powers to control elections to corporate boards of directors.
And the criminals? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac go completely untouched by government action. Their top officials are feted by the Treasury and the Fed instead of rotting in the same jail as Bernie Madoff for their much more serious crimes. The major banks are not to be broken up to separate commercial banking from casino banking, as yet may be the case in the United Kingdom. Nor are the banks to be seriously constrained by miminum cash reserve to total asset ratios and by minimum tangible common equity to total asset ratios. Instead, all the fault lines that fed the 2008 crisis are to remain in place.
In such circumstances, a major opportunity presents itself to the Republican minority in the Senate. If they hold together, they can filibuster this bad bill, and buy time until November 2010. Because so much financial market lobbying money is sloshing around the Capitol, however, my public choice expectation is that this bill will pass into law.
My advice continues to be: Buy gold and take delivery now! And certainly do not turn that precious metal in when a bankrupt United States government eventually legislates to that end.

Chart A Course For Children 2012
Dee Norton's annual dinner and auction returned to Fleet Landing on February 9, 2012.
Chart A Course For Children Dinner 2012
Chart A Course for Children, The Dee Norton Lowcountry Children’s Center’s annual fundraiser, returned to Fleet Landing this year for an evening a good food and company for a great cause.
Partygoers paused to mug for the camera on their way into Fleet Landing, where they were warmly welcomed with cocktails and canapes. The signature LED wineglasses that made a splash at last year’s party were again offered as party favors this year, and guests happily circulated through the silent auction with winking goblets in hand.
A number of Charleston’s very generous philanthropists could be spotted in the crowd, and after all the black-tie and formal social affairs of late, everyone seemed relieved to rub elbows and mingle in a more relaxed atmosphere.
The cocktail hour and silent auction gradually gave way to a three-course meal and live auction, which again featured an adorable puppy.
Chart A Course For Children is the annual fundraiser hosted by Weesie and Tradd Newton along with Fleet Landing Restaurant, and the evening benefits The Dee Norton Lowcountry Children’s Center. The Dee Norton Lowcountry Children’s Center strives to keep children safe from abuse and when abuse occurs, to work with the community to bring healing to children and their families.

New Park and Recreation SportsPlex will be "a dream come true" for East Charlotte neighborhoods.
July 26, 2007 (updated August 6)
A neighborhood in East Charlotte is getting something residents have wanted for years - a place to take the kids for a picnic and a place to kick a soccer ball or whack a softball. Mecklenburg County
Park and Recreation is preparing to convert ninety acres behind a shopping center into Eastway Specialty Park.
The Park and Recreation Department and representatives of surrounding neighborhoods broke ground August 4 on the project at 5399 Waterwood Street, behind the shopping center at Eastway Drive and the Plaza. Click
here to view a slideshow.
The park will incorporate 33 acres from the old Briarwood Neighborhood Park and an additional 57 acres. Click
here for a rendering
of the park master plan.
The sportsplex is projected to open by fall of 2008. It will eventually have nine multipurpose fields, four softball fields, a playground, picnic shelters, basketball courts, tennis courts, recreation center, restrooms and parking. The park will be developed in phases. Phase I will cost $3.6 million, paid for by County bonds approved by voters. This phase will include two multipurpose fields (on the Eastway side), two softball fields (on the Briarwood side), two restroom buildings, trails, roads and parking. Additional phases will be developed as funding is available.
"This park is a dream-come-true for the surrounding community," says Maxine Eaves, former President of the Plaza-Eastway Partners-Northeast Coalition. "We have had meetings and meetings and meetings for years seeking this facility. It will be a center for our neighborhoods and provide important recreation opportunities for both youth and adults."
The park will serve many neighborhoods in the area: Plaza Park I and II, Highland Trace, Citiside, Sharon Park, Hampshire Hills, Bridlewood, Eastbrook, Green Meadows, and Green Forest. Here's an interesting fact: for many years, the property included stables and a half mile horse track where the Herrin Family raised harness trotting horses for racing all over the east coast. When Mecklenburg County acquired the property, the impression of the old track was still clearly visible from the air.

You’re SO amazing.

You are too kind
Thank you for taking the time to leave a comment at this post too. I really appreciate it
Tasty Veedu/ May 28, 2012
Posted on my blog,take a peek:
I still can’t believe I’ve made my first fondant cake!Thanks a million Sawsan… I couldn’t possibly have done it without your lovely blog!
Sawsan@ Chef in disguise/ May 28, 2012
heading over right now
I am really glad I could help, thank YOU for trying my recipes for your nephew’s birthday
Tasty Veedu/ May 27, 2012
Finally!!!I made my very first fondant cake..used your cake recipe,marshmallow fondant recipe,cream pattiserie recipe and added a bit of cocoa to your buttercream recipe…everyone loved it…ill be uploading the pics on my blog soon,but as i promised a pic as soon as possible ,jus visit this link:
Sawsan@ Chef in disguise/ May 27, 2012
Yay! I was waiting for your comment!
I am so glad the cake turned out so well, it is really beautiful and the colors you chose are wonderful.
Hats off to you on a job well done and Happy birthday to your sweet nephew
Tasty Veedu/ May 24, 2012
Should i store the fondant in the fridge or at room temperature if i make it 2 days before??
Sawsan@ Chef in disguise/ May 24, 2012
You should store it wrapped tightly at room temperature, if you store fondant or a fondant covered cake in the fridge the humidity will soften the fondant and causing the colors to bleed
Tasty Veedu/ May 21, 2012
It contains sugar,vegetable oil,fat reduced cocoa powder(13%),wheat flour,whey powder & emulsifiers. These are the hints given on the packet:
It is easy to melt and gives a perfect glossy finish every time.
It is ideal for use as an ingredient in recipes or as a covering for cakes, fairy cakes and tray bakes.
Sawsan@ Chef in disguise/ May 22, 2012
I am not sure it wil work. You can try and if it doesn’t work, you can scrape it and use buttercream as a base under fondant, you can find my recipe for buttercream in my princess cake post
Tasty Veedu/ May 19, 2012
What size cake tin did you use??did you double your usual cake recipe for this cake?can i bake the same recipe in a 9″ cake and divide it into layers?how do you cut it into such neat layers btw…sorry for soo many questions at once,I’ve bought all the ingredients for the cake and fondant…nephews birthday on 26th and I’m really nervous since its my first fondant cake.bt however it turns up I’d definitly post the pics for u,cuz I dont think I would have dared to do the fondant cake if I hadn’t stumbled upon your blog…:)

The pan you see is a 20 by 23 cm which is not one of the standard sizes but it takes 9 cups so a 9 inch round cake pan should be fine. Try measuring how many cups of water your pan takes. If it takes around 9 cups then it should be fine.
For this cake I did not double the recipe, if you double the recipe you will need 2 pans, it really depends on how many people you need to feed.
I cut it using a trick I saw on TV. Measure the thickness of the cake and half it and put tooth picks at the half mark all around the cake and cut immediately above the toothpicks using them as your support and guide.
Please don’t appologize, ask as many questions as you want, I am happy to help. Happy birthday to your nephew and I really can’t wait to see the results and hear about the cake.
Remember take it easy and enjoy it and take your time, you will get better results if you don’t rush things. Try to work at a time when your kitchen is not too hot, hot weather makes fondant sticky and easy to tear. You can make the cake two days in advance and the fondant can be made up to two weeks in advance and you can assemble the cake on the same day or the night before.
Tasty Veedu/ May 20, 2012
Aww…u r so sweet!!I was wondering about how early i can make the cake and I thought it would be a bother to ask you soo many questions,so left it out…but you’ve answered it evn b4 i put de question up..i cant wait to make the cake…I have just one more question regarding chocolate ganache,I’ve bought a bar of Dr.Oetker’s Chocolate flavoured Cake Covering Bar…is it possible to make chocolate ganache using this bar?I bought it by mistake thinking its cooking choc bak frm saudi n nw m bak home in india…its really difficult to get a good quality bar of cooking chocolate here(btw de climate here is VERY hot ryt nw…:S…will try making fondant at night because its cooler then)
Sawsan@ Chef in disguise/ May 21, 2012
I am glad my comment was helpful, please ask as many questions as you want
can you tell me what the ingredients in the Dr Oetker’s chocolate flavored cake covering are? and what are the instructions to prepare it. I don’t think we have this here and I am not sure if it will work in the ganach but if you give me the ingredients maybe I can help you more
As for the fondant, definitely make it at night if the weather is too hot.

That is FABULOUS Sawsan! You are a true artist! You’ve done a wonderful job! Happy birthday to little Bibo and many many happy returns to come! I’m sure that cake made him over the moon!!! My children are already big fans of yours… they loved Horton and laughed their brains out about Bibo checking on Horton every 10 minutes! Really SWEET!

WOW..what a cake! I’m not a huge fan of fondant, but with skills like yours, I’d buy it from you in nano-second, ‘and’ eat the fondant! lol
thefooddoctor/ June 5, 2011
Lol
I did not use to eat fondant too until I came across this recipe at cake central, it actually tastes “good” and you can manage to take a bite or two..
Thank you Lisa for stopping by and for your kind words

Who am I kidding, you’ve got HEAPS of talent! It looks amaaazzinngg…
I can imagine my elephant (if I were ever to make this) looking a bit lopsided with severe down syndrome….
He’d be a very unhappy elephant, indeed.
……………..who ate it?
thefooddoctor/ June 4, 2011
Thank you Fati
and I’m sure if you made an elephant, it will be super cute.
No one ate it yet…it is still in hte fridge under heavy observation from the birthday boy lol

OH MY GODNESS….. Sawsan! You are crazy! (in a good way, of course
). Or I should say you are amazing!! I am 100% sure your son was thrilled to see this. I am, right now. Great job! If I made this kind of cake, I think I would be taking pictures of this creation and would forget it’s birthday celebration. Haha.
thefooddoctor/ June 4, 2011
Loool I wish I had the time to take more pictures but with the exams and all there was very little time.
I’m really glad you like it…I can tell you that my son loved it so much..and that was the whole point…to make him happy

ChefMom/ June 4, 2011
This is absolutely amazing! My kids would flip! I’m so terrible at cakes and am always so impressed when I see a good one – and this is a seriously good one! Wow! (I love the fridge door story too! So cute!)
thefooddoctor/ June 4, 2011

Kate from Scratch/ June 4, 2011

Oh. My. Goodness. I love this. I may need to send this link to my mom as a hint for my birthday. I think she would get scared the second she sees the word “fondant.”
Favorite line in the movie: “You just take care of that meatball sir and leave the freaking out to me!”

Angela/ June 4, 2011
wooooow sawsan . reallly amazing !!!!! and say happy birthday to bibo and kis him for me <3 <3
but I'm not sure i'll succeed in making sponge cake can i make any english cake and just cover it with fondant? and how many cake molds i'll need? one or two?
sooo innocent birthday cake
i'm very confused about my son's i decided to make sponge bob cake couse day by day he loves him more
thefooddoctor/ June 6, 2011
Sorry for the delay Angela..
You can make any cake you like as long as it is some what firm and not too crumbly.
The number of cakes you will need depends on how big you want to make the cake..
Ginger/ June 4, 2011
Wow, this is phenomenal! I cannot get over how perfect Horton looks! You have such talent, I am envious! Have a wonderful time at the party!
thefooddoctor/ June 6, 2011

Maris (In Good Taste)/ June 3, 2011
This is a masterpiece! I really thought the elephant was a toy! Magnificient!
thefooddoctor/ June 3, 2011
Wow! You made my day Maris
Rufus' Food and Spirits Guide/ June 3, 2011
Holy cow! Or should I say elephant. This is just fantastic! I’m so impressed. Also, I think you were smart to go with rice krispies seems like they’d hold up better to a 2-year-old!
thefooddoctor/ June 3, 2011
Thank you Greg and yes you are right..a Horton made of fondant would not have made it to the party…he is still in the fridge and my little boys goes to check on him every 10 minutes..he opens the fridge …HOTEN(that’s what he calls him) ..he smiles and closes the door
My BlogJect/ June 3, 2011
That elephant is so bloody creative! never heard of horton… but seriously impressed with the cake decorating effort! Your son is very lucky!
thefooddoctor/ June 3, 2011
You are too kind..I’m the one who is lucky to have such sweet readers
metrocakegirl/ June 3, 2011
GREAT job!!! This is fantastic.
A tip that might help you get the smooth results you are looking for, after molding the rice treats, paint melted white chocolate over the surface, and let dry, it really makes a big difference. That being said, Horton looks pretty darn smooth to me. Again, what a great job!
thefooddoctor/ June 3, 2011
Thank you so much for the tip and the kind words…will do the white chocolate next time

It's amazing....how swiftly dividing up your Life can be, when everything becomes Yours and Mine, and Ours isn't an approved possessive anymore.
In hindsight, we both knew. We just knew how hard it was going to be to finally walk out, the courage hadn't matured strongly enough, yet to fight through it.
It was about 6 weeks.....6 weeks, where I looked at him differently, every time we did anything, trying to etch it into my brain, burn it so deep that it would never leave.....since I knew, eventually it would. Silly things, ya know? The fuzz on his tummy, the shapes of his toes..... the sound he made when he put his nose on top of my head, taking me in. I watched my brain move through memories of his stories and ideas, our dreams together, and I grasped, hand over hand....trying to bottle them up, somewhere safe. Preserved.
This time, it's different. There was a very clear point, when we both new we had to let each other....be. We walked away knowing we'd literally given each other every inch. No regrets.
I watched my cigarette burn down, my eyes full to the brim, flooded with overwhelming ache...... "Can I please stay here tonight?"
We both wanted one more evening, where we could act as if we still belonged to each other. One more night, one more morning with sleepy heads nestled into one another....one more coffee run, one more nightcap before everything changed.
I held him in the dark, heart pulsing, shaking, our bodies fitting perfectly- the way they did....
"I feel so empty, I feel so dead."
In the way he always knew how to calm me, "Chels, you're more alive than ever. You're more ALIVE than ever." The rawness of my pain was so clearly, LIVING, breathing on the surface of me...throbbing, accessible, conscious.
"Everything in my future has you in it.... I don't want us to be done." Time always stopped together....I felt, if I just kept holding on, we'd never be apart. We were planning things, always- we were moving in October, to a new state...we'd met our "Someday" family, in our dreams...we already liked them, welcomed them...their tiny toes and their feistiness. I couldn't let them go.
"THIS IS YOUR DREAM..... YOU HAVE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE INSIDE OF YOU."
He said to me, while I hid myself inside of his arms, the ones I thought were made specifically for me. He was right, this was my Dream...he was my dream, and now....I had to walk away, knowing with my entire heart that we did every. single. thing we could.....some circumstances are just, unchangeable.
I have the whole Universe inside of me.....and one beautiful love story, that has strengthened my heart, opened me to the most vulnerable place- changed me, irreversibly.
We packed up my things, working together-- silently in sync.... detached still from the profound sadness that had now began to augment our lives.
"Promise me, you'll never feel alone.... you'll never look at the phone and think that there's no one on the other end to call."
He was, is, my Person. He said to me once, "Our souls have seen each other" and I know that they have, to the deepest capacity.
When I was sad, he'd say "I see you." When I was defeated, he'd say, "You love yourself....remember?" He'd known me...he knew my layers and how to remind me of them, when I'd forgotten and I knew his.
We sat there, on the bed, our bed---eating pizza, more for the activity than the nourishment....and he lifted his glass, piercing into me with those perfect blue eyes,"Cheers.....to our overwhelming success."
It was what he'd always said to me when we toasted. Finally, it actually made sense.
We, were successful. We love(d) so deep, so selflessly, cosmically.... we tried. We grew. We sacrificed.
As we divided our things into His and Mine....I knew, there was one thing that would never be divided, apparently....souls can't do that.
So.....My Love, as you will always be to me, here's to teaching me how big my heart actually is, to how magnificent it is to feel that love reciprocated and to our journey, together and now apart....
....I will love you. Cheers, to our overwhelming success.

Painfully exquisite.
maybe all this happened so you would be able to look at the relationship in the positive light it deserved instead of the complete, earth shattering heartbreak of the last time. (not that this is any easier).
my last breakup with the boy i thought i would marry ended on terrible terms, and i have tried so many times since the breakup to make amends, to try to salvage some shred of what was, just to be able to feel like the whole thing wasn't a complete failure....and i wasn't able to. it's the worst feeling.
saying goodbye is never, ever easy. as always, this is beautifully written.
stay strong, lovely <3
That was absolutely amazing.
Heartbreaking.
But as someone who's currently mending, I can say with absolute certainty that sometimes things just have to end.
And when you've both given it your all, that's when you can leave without regrets. x
wow. completely heart-wrenching but beautiful. thank you for sharing and for being so vulnerable and real.
I'm so sorry; my heart hurts for you. </3
My heart aches for you both.
Your words are moving, take care sweet friend. Don't forget that part above all. xo
You are not alone.
Love you.
Beautiful.
oh here i am , crying over yet another one of your beautiful heartfelt posts. what a blessing to have loved that deeply.
It takes courage to walk away, and it's clear you're doing what's best even when your whole soul hurts. You've done everything you can for "us" and now you're doing what you need to for "me." Keep your head up and your heart strong, and just as Your Love says, remember that you're never alone.
i'm sorry to hear that you had to separate, but i know that sometimes you have to walk away. i've had to do it before and as hard as it was i'm a better person because of it.
good lucky lady, you'll do amazing no matter where you go or who you're with.
that sounds like an extremely healthy breakup and i'm happy for you! I'm not sure why it had to end from the story you've so perfectly crafted here (you're SUCH a good writer!)... but i guess when it comes to our success, relationships can sometimes get in the way.
This way of parting is in a way the best and at the same time most heart-breaking kind.
Heartbreaking and but hopeful, Chelsea. You have a beautiful heart.
oh my god (groans as i say this). if this isn't one of the most beautiful things i've ever read.
Lots of hugs.
This is beautiful, to have this with someone, even though it heart wrenching and painful. <3
My first true love and I were able to part this way and we are great friends. Soul mates, as it were. I'm so thankful for that.
Yeah yeah yeah, if it was that great you wouldn't be splitting up. God, you kids irritate me.
I went through this back in march. I thought I'd never recover. I told him I couldn't talk to him because it was just too hard. I went out and drank my sorrows away. I drank too much and cried into anyones arms who would let me. I thought I'd never be me again.
I don't know when this all changed... But now were best friends. Seriously. And not the 'were broken up but are still doing it' best friends. For real.
I've even started dating again, and it's real.
It has been hard, but I am grateful everyday how it has worked out.
I know you'll get through this, and I'm here for you until you do.
anonymous--- leave it be, you have no idea what happened and to honor the person I love, I'm keeping it that way. Does it make you feel better to interject with your nonsense? go away.
This is heartbreaking! Yet inspiring! Being able to walk away is hard, but sometimes it's what you NEED to do. In the long run, it will be for the best!
xoxo
I am so sorry for what you are going through. Breakups are never easy. You are a brilliant writer and this was no exception.
wow...your writing cuts deep. As did your love for one another. I believe you are stronger than I....many blessings. Stay strong....wow. you are so poingant. you know how to "touch there."
So perfectly written.
Love you, darling. Just using yet another excuse to let you know :)
i'm sorry that what you once had is now coming to an end... but it's so clear that you two will always have something. your souls have connected, afterall. this was poignant and beautiful. sending you lots of positive energy from boston. hoping your heart heals and you have brighter days coming soon. xo
Your words are beautiful, Chels, even when beauty is the furthest from what you're experiencing.
I'm so sorry your heart hurts. I wish I had something with more substance to say, but the truth is I can't find the right words after reading such beauty.
But he's right... you're not alone. You're never alone. Though I'm sure that doesn't help much.
This is beautifully written.
once again I have found myself holding my breath as i feel myself rising and falling with every word you type. so beautifully captured. if i ever have a chance to experience a love like this, well, i hope my heart can take it. you're a beautiful person, Chels. hang in there. :)
You got your second chance. You tried, you fought, you sacrificed. You were blessed with not just "one more night" but "a few more months." Be grateful. It will all get better.
When beautiful things end, it hurts like fucking hell...but this, you got the most beautiful, painful ending there could ever be.
It's light years better than an ending the implodes.
But it still hurts like hell.
Gutted. Spoken from the bleeding heart so powerful I can feel the love being squeezed out of you with a pressure impossible to bear. Looking forward to reading the next chapter of your life. You will get over this.
I fell in love with this post. I was gripped. Transfixed. Sad. Moved. Empathetic. I was there, and not just because I have physically/mentally/emotionally been there, but because of your exquisite writing. This is beautiful. You are beautiful.
Cheers to your overwhelming success.
That was so beautiful it gave me chills...Clearly that person was brought into your life for a reason!
"YOU HAVE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE INSIDE OF YOU."
this reminds me of an Elliot Smith song, "Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?"
This made me cry. Literally. I'm crying right now.
xoxo
aw babe...but at least you know you guys gave it everything. That certainty is worth so much because it brings peace. The unknown will keep you up at night. I'm glad you guys are walking away in a way that honors what you two had, that is truly beautiful. You are going to be not only okay but better because of this!
I'm so sorry Chels. I was so happy when you guys gave it another go- it was so wonderful to hear the happy in your words- and now so sad to hear the hurt. You are strong and amazing and everyone who is in your life is surely so grateful. Take time. Cry whenever you want. Just feel what you have to feel.
Today is a feeling every-happy-and-every-painful memory day for me. Sometimes they still sneak up on me, even 6 months later. We can only remind ourselves that tomorrow will be better.
Beautifully written.
this gave me chills and brought many memories back.
you took my breath away. completely.
i have been there...
re-reading your words took me back "there."
you will find your happy, you will. and you will be thankful for this time in your life that will make you stronger. you've already realized the hard part-- the courage to admit it is time to walk away. For reasons only you two can ever know-- you love each other enough to do that and though it makes the saddest good-bye, it all will one day make sense.
Thank you for your honesty. Your raw words spelt out so beautifully.
xoxo
This is heartbreaking, I'm so sorry.. Beautifully written!
thanks for putting words to my divorce. this was beautiful.
wow. im speechless. so beautifully written while it conveys a very true reality of what love is...
My heart just broke for you both. I always wonder why things so beautiful have to end. Why? Why do they? We talk of time needing perfection - like the stars must align for anything worthwhile to work. But I always wonder if what love really needs is sacrifice. I guess you could call it service - service to the other in love. It seems that is the type of love that mends all possible heartache. I wish you the best! May your heart mend and you find something worth fighting for!
The bravest love is wildly faithful and it falls hard again every morning. It knows what we seek may be found in what we already have.
Thank you for this. Thank you for letting us see your rawness and share in your beautiful tragedy.
goosebumps
so beautifully written, yet so heartbreaking at the same time. i am sitting here crying my eyes out! (okay, i also just finished watching jane eyre). i wish you all the best. stay positive.
I cried a little reading this...wishing you the best of luck dear!
Awe sorry to hear that. :( Sounds like you both gave it your best shot. Sometimes those are the hardest breakups. It's almost easier to be mad.
This post almost made me cry. It's so real and so beautiful - and I can relate a million times over. Thank you for sharing.
This is really beautiful.
These are the hardest goodbyes: the ones where you're not angry, there's just love & knowing you have to walk away.
Thanks for sharing this! *Hugs*
I am crying.
Wow, can't believe I'm just finding your blog now. This is incredibly moving and so honest. You are a great writer... and it's almost like you are in my mind more eloquently explaining how I've felt in the past.
I started reading and writing a lot after my gf left me a few days ago. She likes to write too and I see you guys are friends here. The recent change of events taught me a big lesson that life is too short and that if you want it then you go get it. If its not yours then just trust in the Lord and willingly let go and He will do the rest for you. I just started writing on my own blog too. Goodluck and I know God has bigger plans for you.
You defined in words what happened to me this summer...
And I don't even know if I'll see him again although he keeps repeating it, promising it
In different circumstances I would definately fight for this, but the world has other plans for both of us today, there is nothing I can do
I jut know he made me a better person, alive, positive, so incredibly happy all the time
Even without him by my side
;)
Heartbreakingly beautiful.
FML. Mascara all down my face and I cant stop crying.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY, CHELS.
Thank you for sharing this information to us... Keep coming
Nicely done. x

Warm up the walls
Changing the color and texture of walls is an easy way to add some spice to any kitchen. Paint the walls a deep red or blue for a dramatic look, or make your space feel light and airy with a coat of sunny yellow or subtle taupe. Feel free to experiment with decorative painting techniques, such as stripes, geometric patterns or textured finishes.
After you've freshened up the color and texture of your walls, express your personal style through a few new accessories. An antique clock, a picture collage or shelves with colorful canisters are decorative, as well as functional.
Change up the cabinets
Liven up basic cupboards by switching the hardware - it's a simple way to give your existing cabinets a whole new look. Use crystal knobs for a vintage touch, or add stainless steel handles for an ultra-modern, sleek appearance.
And, don't forget about the functional aspect of your cupboards - install shelf liner to ensure cabinets stay clean and well-maintained. Shelf liner protects cabinet shelves and drawers from wear and tear, prevents scratches and keeps spills or drips from damp dishes from causing damage to surfaces.
"I recommend using shelf liner in any kitchen renovation project," says Danny Lipford, home improvement expert and host of the Today's Homeowner with Danny Lipford television series. "It's simple for any homeowner to install and can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth or thrown in the washing machine. My favorite is Easy Liner from Duck brand - it offers an array of non-adhesive and adhesive shelf liners that are stylish and practical for use in any kitchen."
The most popular variety, Smooth Top Easy Liner has a smooth surface that catches messes and spills as they happen, making clean-up a breeze, while the non-slip, gripped underside keeps the liner firmly in place.
Transform your table
Create a delightful dining space with a few changes to your kitchen table. Use a staple gun and a bright fabric to recover your chairs, making items you already own look like new additions to your home. You can even create a new tablecloth using the leftover fabric. Then, design your very own placemats using Smooth Top Easy Liner for a decorative touch that's easy to wipe clean as well as replace.
Make sure to add a chic centerpiece - a vase of fresh flowers, a glass bowl filled with fruit or a collection of candlesticks - to transform your existing tabletop and create a focal point for guests as they enter the room.
Brighten the basics
Adding color from floor to ceiling is a great way to improve the overall feel of your kitchen. To start, try adding accessories to areas of your kitchen that feel blase. Bring in color at the highest points of the kitchen by adding faux plants or interesting knickknacks to the space above cabinets. Then, look low and consider the floor. Placing a colorful area rug beneath the table can bring additional interest and color to the kitchen, while also protecting the floor against scratches.
Window treatments are another effective, eye-catching way to make any kitchen pop, whether you're adding new valances, cornices or even long panels. When choosing fabrics, make a statement with bright colors, or choose an unexpected, bold pattern for a contemporary approach. Sophisticated stripes, pretty plaids or fun florals are also a nice choice for kitchens. Follow these tips to make your kitchen as chic as your dinner is delicious - you'll create a flavorful design that will look good enough to eat.

Most of the time, I relish in the responsibility and creativity of deciding what we eat on a daily basis. Planning 2-3 meals in advance usually helps keep things just organized enough to take some of the stress off, but not so much that it zaps any last minute creativity from the equation. Often in the 3 meal scheme, just one of them will be something totally new. Sometimes, though, I will have greatly overestimated my capacity for new recipes. Just such a scenario played out a few weeks ago when I just couldn’t bring myself to cook. It was too much. I was tired and stressed. Mix in a little guilt and you’ve got the makings of one fantastic meltdown. The potential loss of a good meal really gets me down.
I forget what I had planned to cook now. It doesn’t even matter. All I know is there was crying and consoling and an agreement that Paul would make dinner. And not in that because-I-have-to way either. In an excited and eager way, like he was almost waiting for the floodgates to open so he could actually cook something without me glaring over his shoulder. He promised me Potstickers, people. While I could only nod through the tears, I retired to the couch with a drink in hand, giddy just thinking about them. He even let me “help” by allowing me to read the ingredient list to him and walk him through it. It was the perfect combination of being the boss and not having to do any of the work. It was a rare and beautiful gift and that’s why he’s a keeper, ladies.
Paul makes the absolute best Potstickers. I find this incredibly impressive, partly because I suck so much at making them. I can never wrap them in a way that gets all of the air pockets out, and mine are always ugly looking. Paul has just the right technique. Despite hardly ever cooking, he has certain recipes that he can pull out and completely blow you away. (Other times he’ll try to make an omelet without greasing the pan, but, you know…a mistake you make only once.) The Potstickers were heavenly and they are a fun appetizer-for-dinner meal that feels really special. We’re addicted to these and I bet you will be, too. And a brief note to non-cooking spouses: never underestimate the breakdown.
These used to be Ku’s pork dumplings, but now they are Paul’s Potstickers.
Potstickers (adapted from American's Test Kitchen)
1 lb ground pork
2 cups napa cabbage, minced finely
4 green onions, sliced
4 tsp low-sodium soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger, optional
2 cloves garlic, minced
fresh black pepper
1 lb ground pork
dipping sauce:
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1-2 Tbsp water, to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp sesame oil
hot stuff: either 1/8 tsp chili paste, a dash of hot sauce, or minced red chilies, to taste about 30 dumplings with this amount of filling, serving about 3 people as a main course, or 6 as an appetizer.
To make potstickers:
1. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to a nonstick pan. Place over medium heat and add enough dumplings in the pan to form a single layer, but without the dumplings touching. Cook 3 minutes or until the bottoms have crisped and browned.
2. Pour 1/2 cup of water in the pan, cover it, and let them cook (without peeking!) on low for 10 minutes, or until all the water is gone. Set a timer!
3. The dumplings should be brown and crisp on the bottom, but if not, let them cook a few minutes more to get crisp again.

Giant of a first inning sets tone for NL's rout
Panda plates three in five-run frame off Verlander; Melky named MVP
KANSAS CITY -- Talk about a lasting first impression. The National League sure knows how to make one.
The NL struck for five runs against American League ace Justin Verlander in the first inning and cruised to an 8-0 victory in the 83rd All-Star Game on Tuesday night with 40,933 fans packing Kauffman Stadium.
It was Kansas City's third Midsummer Classic, and in this longtime AL stronghold, the NL has won all three games. The first two came in 1960 and 1973. This time, though, there was added relevance because the NL, for the third straight year, had won home-field advantage for the World Series.
Giants center fielder Melky Cabrera, back where he played last season for the Royals, earned the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award presented by Chevrolet after bashing a two-run homer in the fourth inning to go along with a single and run scored in the NL's big first frame.
"I didn't come to win an MVP. That's just a surprise. It's a great gift that the Lord gave me," Cabrera said. "But the same opportunity that Kansas City gave me last year is the same opportunity that San Francisco is giving me every day to showcase my talent. Again, I'm just very thankful for the fans that voted for me to come here."
AL players must have been blinking in disbelief in the first inning. This was a Verlander they'd rarely seen. The big Tigers right-hander was roughed up for five runs on four hits and two walks as all nine NL batters trouped to the plate in his only inning.
That's right, five runs. It's happened twice before to Verlander in his brilliant career, but this was an awkward time for a repeat -- his first All-Star start.
"Obviously you don't want to go out like that, but hey, I had fun," Verlander said. "That's why I don't try to throw 100 [mph] in the first inning. Doesn't usually work out too well for me."
Even so, Verlander was intent on pleasing the throng at Kauffman.
"Obviously I don't want to give up runs. I know it means something," Verlander said. "But we're here for the fans. I know the fans don't want to see me throw 90 and try to hit the corners. So, just let it heat. Have fun."
It was the NL, though, that had the most fun.
Cabrera's one-out single and Ryan Braun's double off the right-field fence accounted for the first run. Verlander, on a 3-2 pitch, showed some finesse with a third-strike floater that Joey Votto gazed upon in wonder. However, Verlander loaded the bases by walking Carlos Beltran on a 3-2 delivery and Buster Posey on four straight pitches.
"It is surprising, because he's one of the toughest pitchers in the game through the last year," Beltran said. "Normally, when you face him during the season, you get 90, 91 [mph] early in the game. But he came out firing 97, 98. He was missing his spots, and we were able to capitalize."
Pablo Sandoval, the Kung Fu Panda of the Giants, launched a liner down the right-field line that struck the wall just fair and rolled away from Jose Bautista for a three-run triple.
"I just got a pitch I can hit," Sandoval said. "He didn't have command of his fastball. I just got a curveball right there, hanging, so I put a ball on the wall."
Panda trundled home on Dan Uggla's infield hit, a grounder to shortstop Derek Jeter. Finally, on his 35th pitch of the inning, Verlander got Rafael Furcal to bounce into the third out.
But it was 5-0, sucking some air out of the AL-leaning crowd.
Verlander became only the third pitcher to give up five or more earned runs in one inning or less. The others were Atlee Hammaker of the Giants in 1983 and Sandy Consuegra of the White Sox in 1954.
Such a first-inning outpouring of runs happened just once before, in 2004 when the AL scored six runs at Minute Maid Park in Houston. It also matched the NL's biggest inning in All-Star history.
Matt Cain, the NL version of a hard-throwing right-hander, had much better luck. After a leadoff infield single by Jeter, the Giants' perfect game pitcher whizzed through two scoreless innings and registered on his best moments meter.
"It's definitely right up there with all of them. All the nerves, all the pressure and all the excitement," Cain said. "That was a thrilling two innings right there."
A Cardinals twosome combined for the NL's sixth run in the fourth inning against Rangers lefty Matt Harrison. Furcal laced a two-out triple into the right-field corner, and he scored on pinch-hitter Matt Holliday's single to right.
But wait, these guys weren't finished. Cabrera lined a home run into the left-field bullpen for two more runs and an 8-0 lead. Harrison didn't escape before giving up a triple to Braun, also into the right-field corner. Braun was left at third base, but his triple gave the NL a collection of three, an All-Star Game first.
Just four innings into the game, NL manager Tony La Russa, in his farewell appearance, had all he needed for victory.
"You just don't usually get an eight-run lead in a big game like this," he said. "It was just lucky, like the other 30 years have been for me."
It wasn't the most lopsided shutout win in All-Star history. That was 12-0 by the AL in 1946 at Boston's Fenway Park.
The AL stirred up some mischief in the fifth inning against Dodgers lefty Clayton Kershaw by loading the bases on one-out singles by David Ortiz and Mike Napoli (youngest All-Star Bryce Harper lost the ball in left field) and Asdrubal Cabrera's two-out walk. But the promise fizzled as pinch-hitter Ian Kinsler flied out.
Nothing else developed, which meant that AL manager Ron Washington of the Rangers had become just the second pilot in history to lose two consecutive World Series and two consecutive All-Star Games concurrently with the same clubs. The other was the Braves' Bobby Cox.
Billy Butler, the Royals' representative, pinch-hit for David Ortiz in the seventh inning and grounded out to third base against Cole Hamels. Up again in the ninth, he struck out against Joel Hanrahan.
A poignant moment came in the NL sixth when the Braves' Chipper Jones, heading for retirement, made his final All-Star appearance. He grounded a single into right field against lefty Chris Sales.
This was the first game of his career at Kauffman Stadium.
"Unbelievable. I regret not having been given the opportunity to play here before," Jones said. "It is a beautiful venue. I am happy that I got to play here one time before I retire."
And it was a beautiful evening, the game starting at 90 degrees, with Hall of Famer George Brett, Kansas City's official All-Star Ambassador, tossing the first pitch to Butler, who'd been greeted by a roaring standing ovation.
This game marked a reaffirmation to the country and the world that Kansas City was an old-style baseball town, but with modern amenities, its roots running deeper than just the 1985 World Series title and with a rich history beyond even Brett. By all accounts, the team, the city, state and region hit a tape-measure home run.
"Everything about our stay here was about as perfect as possible, win or lose," La Russa said. "Doesn't surprise anybody. ... That's kind of the way Midwesterners are."
Helps, too, when you go away with a big victory.

You can't ask for better support as a pitcher than you get from our club. I would stack up my club's lineup against any lineup for any team in baseball. If we're not the best offensive club, then we're certainly one of the best.
That's not taking anything away from any other team, but I like our lineup one through nine as much as I like the Yankees', the Indians', etc. You name them and we're right there with them.
One of the keys to our lineup is our depth. When you look at it from a pitcher's perspective, there's no taking a hitter off; there is no breathing room. In other words, you can't just blow by someone.
There are a lot of excellent one-two punches in the game right now, but I feel that the combination of Gary Sheffield and Magglio Ordonez, the two guys in the middle of our lineup, are as good as any combo. Both guys are proven and both guys are producing at a high rate right now. They are both great, professional hitters who also possess a lot of power at the plate.
Our catalyst, Curtis Granderson, is a one-of-a-kind threat at the top. He can hit for a lot of power; he hits a lot of triples; he steals his fair share of bases, and at a very successful rate; and he can motor from first to home on a double. He has the sort of tools that can quickly change a game. He improves our chances of scoring runs and winning games.
As a pitcher, when you give up only a few runs, you know you have a good chance to win the game. You know you're probably going to get strong support.
If I had to face our lineup, I would do it like I attack any other good lineup. I would attack them and try to put the hitters back on their heels.
We're in a tight race and it remains to be seen whether our offense will be able to help carry us all the way to October. I know one thing: I wouldn't trade our offense for anybody else's offense.
Jeremy Bonderman, the 26th overall pick out of high school in the 2001 First-Year Player Draft, is 10-4 with a 4.50 ERA and 121 strikeouts over 136 innings for the Tigers this season. He won 14 games in each of the previous two seasons.

The combination of an efficient effort from Jay Cutler and a dominant performance from the defensive unit proved to be enough to lead the Chicago Bears to a convincing 31-20 victory over the reeling San Diego Chargers.
Cutler continued his solid play in the win over San Diego, completing 18/31 for 286 yards and 2 TD's. Cutler hooked up with Johnny Knox and Kellen Davis for TD passes and also scored on a one yard TD run. With Matt Forte and Marion Barber struggling to get anything going, Cutler completed throws to eight different receivers.
The Bears defense was simply remarkable in the second half, dominating the Chargers offense following a TD throw from Philip Rivers to Vincent Jackson early in the third quarter. The defense intercepted Rivers twice in the final quarter, and in one of the most amazing stats you will ever see, held the Chargers to 0 total yards in the fourth quarter.
Chicago will look to pick up its sixth consecutive victory when it hosts Oakland on Sunday. The Chargers will hope to end their five-game losing streak when they host Denver in a key AFC West matchup on Sunday.

All eyes will be on Francisco Liriano when the right-handed pticher makes his debut for the Chicago White Sox against the only team the 28-year old had ever known before Saturday's trade: the Minnesota Twins. Liriano pitched in part sof seven seasons during his injury-plagued time in Minnesota, earning a trip to the All-Star Game in 2006 and the AL Comeback Player of the Year award in 2010. Chicago will be looking for a steady performance after dropping its last two games following a five-game winning streak.
Liriano was 3-10 this season with a 5.31 ERA for the Twins. He'll be opposed by Nick Blackburn, who's 4-6 this season with a 7.99 ERA.
Game Date & Time: Tuesday, July 31, 7:10 p.m. CT

A Sandwich a Day: The Hot Beef Sirloin at Smokin' Woody's
[Photograph: Josh Conley]
For what I consider to be Chicago-style barbecue (rib tips and hot links), you can do much better than Smokin' Woody's. Uncle John's, Honey 1, and Barbara Ann's all come directly to mind. So ordering the Hot Beef Sirloin ($9.95 with one side) was like drafting a quarterback in the first round—lots of potential upside tempered with serious bust potential. Luckily, this one's a winner.
There's no reason this sandwich shouldn't work, really; lightly smoked beef sirloin, cheddar cheese, grilled onions, and Buffalo sauce loaded onto a Kaiser roll. The sirloin is smoked to a chewy, but still tender, medium. Though not much smoke permeates the meat, it has plenty of good flavor on its own. The cheddar adds a little bite and plenty of creamy gooey-ness, though I wouldn't have said no to another slice. The onions add a great sweet complement to the sandwich, and offset the formidable Buffalo sauce, which finds the right balance of tang and heat. This sandwich has franchise tag written all over it.

I know there probably is no real connection, but I couldn’t help but wonder if Mayor Rahm Emanuel considered a last-minute change to the five people he picked for his infrastructure trust – a body that is supposed to set priorities for repair projects such as mass transit and sewer.
For Emanuel included an organized labor official among his people who will have influence over the city’s maintenance – Chicago Federation of Labor President Jorge Ramirez.
HE MADE HIS announcement at roughly the same time that the Chicago Teachers Union was making it known that they took a massive “drop dead” vote toward the Chicago Public Schools leadership – which is merely taking its cue from Emanuel in the hard-line it is adopting toward contract negotiations.
“Drop dead.” How else would you describe a vote of 90 percent of teachers favoring a strike, and only 2 percent (1.82 percent, to be more precise) opposing the idea.
Considering that we have to go back to the days of Harold Washington as mayor to find a time when teachers actually walked off the job (for four weeks, back in 1987), it would seem that city and schools officials have done a thoroughly good job of ticking off their teachers to get them so overwhelmingly willing to take to a picket line.
Now I realize that just because the teachers voted to strike, that does not mean they will actually do so.
IT MERELY MEANS that the Chicago Teachers Union leadership can call for a strike at any time now, if they think that negotiations have reached an impasse. The teachers just gave them the authority to do so. I’ll give the example of a suburban high school district, Thornton 205 based in Harvey, where teachers took a strike authorization vote one day, and the school board voted to approve a new contract agreement the next.
Somehow, I doubt that will occur in Chicago. But let’s hope that educators and administrators all manage to act like adults and continue to try to strive toward serious negotiations. Anything’s possible.
Besides, the two sides have all summer and the early autumn to try to talk things down and reach a serious compromise somewhere between the 2 percent raise for next year that was the Chicago Public Schools’ initial offer, and the 29 percent that the teachers’ union initially asked for.
Although when one considers that it was 20 percent more pay for having to work 20 percent more hours and another 4 percent to compensate for a pay hike they had to give up, it seems they’re really asking for a 5 percent hike for the upcoming year.
SOMEHOW, THE DIFFERENCE between 5 and 2 doesn’t seem so great!
This is all about playing political hardball, and I’m sure on a certain level Emanuel would like it if he could claim a conquest of the Chicago Teachers Union among his first accomplishments in office.
Which is why the overwhelming strike authorization vote announced Monday shouldn’t be such a surprise. My guess is that union boss Karen Lewis is trying to show she has just as big a (ahem) as Emanuel.
Personally, I take the 90 percent support for a strike about as seriously as I do the idea of teachers doing 20 percent more work for only a 2 percent pay hike for the first year – and a pay freeze for the next couple of school years.
THEY’RE BOTH NONSENSE-TALK. Ridiculous rhetoric! Absolute arrogance, mixed in with a touch of pulp!
We’re in the second week of June. Which means there is still plenty of time for people to get serious. And I mean people on both sides of this equation.
Let’s only hope that they do, and that come September, Lewis’ rhetoric about “overpaid outside consultants” and “billionaire education dilettantes” will be long-forgotten because the two sides will have come together and made it possible for us to go a full quarter of a century without a Chicago schools strike.
That would be a serious accomplishment we as Chicagoans could take pride in.

Along with many Americans, I wondered what the NRA was going to say yesterday in response to the Newtown massacre. In what I thought was a shrewd move, the NRA was unusually quiet this week, including shutting down their social media presence. I’m not sure if they did it out of respect for the victims, or wanted to develop a strategy to salvage their relevance and credibility with much of the American public. Given their statement yesterday, I think they developed their ideas in a boardroom while drinking whiskey and playing the Call of Duty Black Ops II video game (They likely wouldn’t have played their own NRA sport shooting video game that was roundly panned a few years ago).
Now before some of the diehard NRA wing nuts jump down my throat, please understand that I am not in favor of eliminating law abiding citizens from owning guns. I own a shotgun and a revolver. The handgun is an old Colt 38 Special that was my great-grandfather’s service weapon when he was the Marshal of the City of Ruston, Washington. I have a newspaper article from the early 1900’s where he used this weapon in a gun battle with a burglar (the burglar lost). I enjoy target shooting and bird hunting. I am envious of my friends who have beautiful gun collections, and consider many of them beautiful works of art.
With that said, I’m blown away by the NRA’s myopic and inflammatory statements yesterday. My interpretation of what they said is; this incident was caused by;
- Extremely violent video games
- Reluctance to prosecute gun crime cases
- Gun free school zones
- No one in the school was armed to fight back
Their approach? Make a very public and inflammatory demand to place armed police officers in every school. OK… which schools? Public? Private? Daycare? Tribal? What about all of the other public gathering areas that have experienced mass shootings, like malls and movie theatres? What about the economic reality where federal, state and local law enforcement officers and programs are being slashed? What about the fact that a school resource officer engaged the shooters at the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, and was significantly outgunned (An officer with a sidearm is no match for someone intent on mayhem with a high powered/capacity assault rifle). I’m guessing their myopic approach is going to come back to haunt them. I’m not a card carrying member of the NRA, but if I was I would have dropped it before their press conference was over. The current NRA leadership is nuts (or they were really drunk when they came out of the boardroom).
It now appears that the Newtown murderer had significant mental health and social issues. We may never know what made him snap, steal his mother’s guns, and kill everyone he encountered in a very short amount of time. Where does the NRA stand on helping those with significant mental health issues?
When the New York City Police Commissioner expresses disappointment in the NRA’s stance (and yet says he is not surprised), you have to wonder; What the hell were they thinking? Why didn’t they simply express outrage at the tragedy, call for increased dialogue and action to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with mental health issues, call for increased support and funding for families struggling with the mentally ill, and offer to aggressively participate in a national dialogue on how best to proceed? Instead, they came out swinging defensively, looking and sounding desperate and totally out of touch with America’s growing concern about gun violence, especially the horrific violence that occurs in 2-3 minutes by a deranged kid with a high caliber semi-auto rifle with a 30 shot magazine. What is revolting is they took this approach before the last of the victims had been buried.
The NRA leadership may have just flailed their organization into irrelevance. Let’s hope the majority of NRA members have a more realistic view of the need to take positive and realistic steps to prevent these type of events from happening again. The victims and families in Newtown and all of the past mass killing tragedies deserve nothing less.

On my way back from work this past Thursday, I crashed my car. I almost fucking died and almost killed my coworker in the passenger's seat. The car flew into a mud field and flipped over twice. Miraculously, neither of us were seriously injured. The seatbelts saved our lives.
So, I no longer have a car. Crazy shit.
That very night, that same coworker became my girlfriend. I've known her for the entire nine months I've been working here and maybe that car crash made me think of things in different ways.
I'll probably be a lot less active in the seduction community during my relationship with her.
Wear your seatbelt,

I don’t know what they’re saying exactly because I don’t speak this language but I think it’s about the constant struggle a woman experiences when caught between innocence and her sexuality. A woman must often repress her sexuality in order to protect herself but within there is this passion that can only be unlocked once she finds someone she can connect with and feel ready with.
This will go almost completely ignored now that there are dead Americans to talk about, but Newtown Elementary was not the only school attacked today.
Wow.
It’s happening all over the world. Society is collapsing. These seemingly random acts of violence are all connected by one basic thing: People are unhappy with their lives and what they see around them. They envy children because children get to be happy. It’s socially acceptable for a child to be silly and happy. Adults are told they must hide their emotions at all times and never express them and must also work nonstop. This system is wrong. That lifestyle is wrong. People are lashing out everywhere. This keeps happening. Violence in public places. Until people re-evaluate their lives and start to realize that maybe working nonstop is unhealthy and is driving people insane nothing will get better. Turn off the TV and start reading reliable online news sources. Things are changing but it’s going to take a lot of darkness before we reach the light. Pay attention to the people around you and take care of those you care about. Society is shifting.
Who knew such republicans existed.
HOLY SHIT, give this man an award.
I didn’t even know there was such a thing as Republicans for Planned Parenthood.
SHOCKED
Contrary to popular belief, most Republicans aren’t bad people! The Republican Party has become incredibly warped over the past few years, going far more right than most right-winged citizens. It’s unfortunate that the Republican Party is the new name for the Tea Party these days.
I had no idea that that group existed either.

Written to the pages of the law good lord
The Cold Continent latch key child
Ran away one day and started acting foul
King of where the wild things are daddy’s proud
cos the Roman Empire done passed it down
Imported and tortured a work force
and never healed the wounds or shook the curse off
Now the grown up Goliath nation
Holdin open auditions for the part of David, can you feel it?
Nothing can save ya, you question the reign
You get rushed in and chained up
Fist raised but I must be insane

Try n’ separate a man from his soul

I noticed this picture floating around on Facebook today. It pisses me off. Here’s my 2 cents:
But you’re not and they aren’t. In this incident racism isn’t really relevant. People are ignoring the real issue.
There’s no sense in complaining about racism that didn’t even happen! There are actual real examples of racism happening all the time. Let’s talk about those if you want to talk about racism! This shooting was tragic and should be talked about but it shouldn’t be turned into a conversation about racism because that doesn’t apply here. It was senseless violence and should be addressed for what it is. Don’t turn it into an issue it’s not just so you can have something to say.
Racism is bad and is definitely an issue but in this case it doesn’t really apply. People like to bring up racism when it doesn’t apply because it’s a very charged issue and is easy to define. Racism is obviously wrong. So if people bring up how wrong racism is they automatically get to feel smart because they’re right. This incident is not about being right or wrong! The real issue here is senseless violence but senseless violence is harder to understand and harder to talk about. People are ignoring the real issue here!
People should never just go around talking about racism and nothing else when things like this happen. Violence isn’t that simple.

Carrot Barley Galettes
For the past three years now, I've been writing a column in ELLE à table, a French bimonthly cooking magazine. This column spans two pages, and I generally devote one to an ingredient (cardamom! buckwheat! white chocolate!) and what you can do with it, the other to a food experience or trend (superfoods! Japanese pastries! mushroom picking!) and why you should care about it.
In the next installment (spoiler alert), due to appear in the March/April issue of the magazine, I'm declaring my passion for the rolled grain -- flocon de céréale in French -- as a multi-faceted ingredient and an all-around trouper: cheap, nutritious, and versatile.
If the term "rolled grain" doesn't ring a bell, just think of oatmeal: each of these little flakes is in fact an oat groat that was rolled between two tight cylinders to make it flat (ouch). In fact, when you look at a rolled grain closely, you can recognize the shape of the original grain, with the "seam" in the middle (I admit without shame that I realized this only recently). The same treatment can be, and is, applied to other unsuspecting grains: spelt, barley, rice, kamut, wheat, rye, you name it.
I am never without a bag or two or four of assorted flocons, and I use them in very many things, from granola to cookies, from bread dough to fruit crumbles, and from gratins to savory tarts.
And I've recently added a new type of preparation to the list of great things rolled grains and I can accomplish: please meet the carrot and barley galette, a vegan vegetable and grain patty that would love to meet you for lunch sometime.
All you need to do is combine rolled barley with grated carrots and a few seasoning ingredients, add water, wait for this mixture to swell and cohere, then shape into patties and cook in a skillet until crisp and golden with a tender heart.
I call it carrot and barley because, well, I've mostly made it with grated carrots and rolled barley, but naturally you can take the concept and run away with it (just don't trip and fall on your face), using whatever grain and vegetable you like.
It works especially well with root vegetables (I've made a beet and spelt variation for instance), but nobody says you can't try it with finely minced winter greens, grated Hokkaido squash, chopped mushrooms, or, come warmer days, with peas and later zucchini or tomatoes (in that case, you'll have to adjust the amount of water to account for the juices). The one thing to remember is that said vegetable won't really have time to cook in the skillet, so you'll have to decide whether it needs to be cooked beforehand, or can be eaten semi-raw.
Carrot and barley galettes
- 200 grams (7 ounces) grated carrots, from 2 medium carrots
- 200 grams (7 ounces, about 2 cups) rolled barley, or other rolled grain (oats, spelt, rice, etc.), or a mix
- 1 small shallot, grated or finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 3 1/2 tablespoons ground flax seeds (from 2 tablespoons whole seeds; this works as a binder to help the patties hold their shape)
- 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast (look for it in organic stores; substitute a grated hard cheese if you prefer)
- olive oil
- fresh chervil or cilantro
- hot sauce
Makes eight 85-gram (3-ounce) patties.
Combine all the ingredients from carrots to nutritional yeast in a medium mixing bowl. Add 240 ml (1 cup) water and stir well. Cover and let stand for at least 1 hour or until the next day (refrigerate if you let it stand for more than an hour). The mixture will gradually become more cohesive; the longer it rests, the easier it will be to shape.
Pour a bit of oil in a skillet and place over medium heat. Divide the mixture into eight equal portions (if you want to be really exact, each should weigh 85 grams or 3 ounces). Wet your hands lightly, scoop out a portion, and shape it into a patty between the palms of your hands. You can make the patties thicker or thinner depending on your preference. Repeat with as many portions as you want to cook. Transfer the patties to the hot skillet and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden.
Serve immediately, with a sprig of chervil and a dash of hot sauce. The raw mixture will keeps for about 2 days in the fridge, tightly covered.

Good restaurant in Venice
Venice now exists only for tourism, so indifferent food and terrible service are easy to find. After two days of really unpleasant dining experiences in October we took an acquaintance's advice and tried the Gam-Gam, "Bar Ristorante Ebraico", a kosher restaurant in Cannaregio by the Ponte di Guglie at the edge of the ghetto. We were not at all interested in kosher food (and the big window poster of Rabbi Schneerson was pretty off-putting for me) but it turned out to be such a pleasure we ate there the next 2 nights too.
A number of Venetian specialties originated in the ghetto, so most of the Gam-Gam menu was both Jewish and Italian (although some items were Israeli). All in all, it was probably the best restaurant we ate at in Italy.
Carciofi Fritti (deep-fried artichoke hearts) and Sarde in Saor (fried sardines marinated with alternating layers of onions) are perhaps the best-known Venetian dishes from the ghetto, and both were irresistible. The Couscous con Pesce (with fish) and Spaghetti Mar Rosso (Red Sea spaghetti) both had a really delicious tomato fish sauce. The salads were the best we had in four Italian cities. The Melanzane (eggplant) del Ghetto is harder to describe, since we ordered it twice and it was different -- but delicious -- each time. Also notable were the latkes, but they weren't the flat potato pancakes my mother made; these were big egg shaped deep-fried things, crunchy on the outside and delicious. An Israeli antipasto platter was also very good, as was a fish filet with a spicy sauce.
The decor was nothing much but pleasant enough, and the prices are reasonable, everyone is friendly, the service is fast and efficient (most of the waitpersons seem to be Israeli students), everybody speaks English, and the #5 vaporetto Ponte di Guglie stop is right in front of the restaurant. Tel. 041/715 284
We also enjoyed Gam Gam. In fact my husband was sick one night and my 12 year old and I brought him back matza ball soup from Gam Gam--I'm sure that's what cured him.
I also have to agree about the preponderance of so-so food in Venice. This was our third trip. The first two trips the food was the highlight for me but this time the mediocre food was a huge disappointment.

Seattle - CSA's and Wine clubs
Hey folks - I'm a recent transplant to the northwest (coming back to fiancee's native grounds), and it looks like after months of travelling and general non-employed vacation time, we decided to finally get our butts in gear and find jobs and a place in the seattle area.
So, I am looking for reccs on two things:
- a good, reasonably priced CSA : in San Diego I was lucky enough to be part of the Be Wise Ranch CSA, although we had to eventually stop due to having far too much food for two people (and far too much mizuna/chard/collards for anybody!). The produce was lovely, and the price was reasonable - came to about 20 dollars for a box every two weeks.
is there anything similar up here? I've looked around and found a lot of organic delivery and such, but that seems a lot more expensive. Preferably a CSA that lets you pick your produce to a degree would be great too.
- a wine club or something similar: a bunch of my family and friends back in california do this kind of thing, and from the events ive gone to with them it seems to be a great way to meet people and put things on the social calendar. I know Washington makes some great wine, but I'm not sure how big the scene is in seattle.
Thanks in advance.
Cascade Harvest Coalition just released their 2009 brochure of local CSAs:
Debs.
- re: goofyg
fullcirclefarm.com all the way. You're always getting the food at least a day or two before any PCC or other small organic market, I promise. A few pointers:
1) I never eat lettuce, and it seemed that lettuce was often an option for the weekly box. So, I added "lettuce" to my list of 3 items I never want in my box. That way, they substitute it for you, and you have an extra substitution to use.
2) try some of the local foods you thought you didn't like. You might find them more enjoyable when they are fresher.
3) Just accept the fact that you'll throw away some of the food. Every kitchen has waste.
It's no biggie. If you compost it, you'll still go to garbage heaven.
As for a wine club--check out Michael Cawdrey's shop- "Fremont Wine Warehouse".
He has regular tastings, he's most eager to help, all wines are under $25, and the man truly knows wine. Go.
Got our first Full Circle Farm CSA Box yesterday. I will say that I'm very impressed. It seems like a good deal and will certainly force us to eat more healthy. In fact, I tasted my first sunchoke last night which was actually grown at the farm and it was delicious.
Anyway, anything can happen in the future but as far as the first box goes, I highly recommend the service.
CSA: I've been using Full Circle Farm as our winter CSA, we get a small box of organic veggies and fruit every other week ($29/box). I really like their system, you can make up to five substitutions per box, you can suspend your service if you're going to be out of town, you can order additional items from their "green grocer" section, they denote what they grow themselves, what's sourced from other PNW growers, and what's not local.
Wine Club: Verve Wine Bar in Columbia City does tastings Tues evenings, price is $5-10 and they pour 5-7 wines. Esquin does free tastings on Thur evenings and Sat afternoons. I really like Wine Outlet, they have open bottles to taste every day, I highly recommend checking them out this Sunday (3/30) during their pig roast.
I use Nature's Last Stand for my CSA delivery and am very happy with them. Yes, you get critters sometimes but nothing that you wouldn't see if you grew your own vegetables organically. My husband and I get a small box every two weeks for $35. It's the right amount for us.
The Pike Place Market also operates something like this and I've done that in the past. The quality and variety of produce was a tad higher but it was more expensive, the boxes were bigger and therefore more than my husband and I could use, and you had to pick them up at the market.
- re: Lauren
I used to belong to the Pike Place Market CSA. THey are discontinued.
For a wine club--you mean tastings and the like? lots of wine shops have free and pay tastings--try Pike and Western, Esquin, McCarthy and Schiering. Chateau Ste. Michelle is close by and has wine events. Tons of restaurants do wine dinners. The magazine Northwest Palate always has some listings. Culinary Communion does cooking classes and tasting classes.
I just signed up for Full Circle Farm's CSA after some good recommendations from friends. I can't speak to quality yet as I get my first box on Thursday. I will say that the website is very easy to navigate, specifically identifies Northwest-grown and/or Full Circle Farm-grown items and they allow substitutions. Check it out at fullcirclefarm.com and I'll try and post a review when I get the box.
- re: yoyo11
- re: yoyo11
I've signed up for full circle farms in the past, they're very nice and the produce is great too. There was this one time I got a few unwelcome visitors on my broccoli but they totally made it right by giving me a little something in the next box I got. The only reason we stopped is that I still find it challenging to eat my fruits and veggies (sorry, I'm more of a junk food girl). So basically I stopped doing CSA period, I didn't swap to someone else. If I ever go back to it, I'll totally join full circle again. I think they even have eggs and some other stuff now.
- re: lollybird
- re: Jeters
absolutely - that was one of the things we loved about them. They were also really great about us postponing boxes which we would periodically do when the veggies got just too much for me and I had to have a junk food break. I must have postponed at least 3 of my 10-box set. It took months for me to get through the entire lot.

- re: lollybird
- re: Jeters
why are you off bread? I had to get away from white bread for a couple of reasons, so now I'm on ezekiel bread (sesame, and cinnamon raisin) and the crushed wheat sourdough from trader joes. Had to go to all the grocery stores in the area to read every single ingredients list. Now, practically the only time I have white bread is when I hit Wibbleys for my weekly burger.
I just picked up a flyer for Seattle Uncorked.. Haven't tried anything with them so far, but the membership fee is waived if you sign up before July '08.

The drive to Vegas is a mere 5 hrs and when you get there, you can eat whatever your hearts desire. I suggest you eat here in SD, or perhaps Temecula, then suck it up and land in Vegas where you will find one of the greatest cocentrations of really amazing choices for your eating pleasure in North America. (Take that New York!)
Guy Savoy. Gary Danko. Michael Minna. Picasso. Nobu. (gulp) Buffets. Just to name a few.
And not all Vegas options are on the high end like these above. We love - LOVE - Lotus of Siam. Decidedly not Vegas atmosphere. Off strip, but nearby to the south end hotels. Google it - you'll see it's one of the most well-regarded Thai places in the world.
But if you must nosh en route, there's a Tommy's in Barstow ()
Happy travels.
That drive is not really designed for fussy eaters the way I would define that term. But there are a few non-fast food, non-chain places that could do the trick.
Just North of Barstow is Peggy Sue's Diner, a 50's nostalgia place that is popular with travelers and truckers. Not earth-shattering, but pretty decent.
In Baker, there's The Mad Greek, which is an order-at-the-counter place that does a pretty decent job with traditional Greek foods as well as burgers.
There are probably some decent alternatives in Victorville, but I haven't found anything there but the chains (On The Border, Outback, Applebee's, Olive Garden, Marie Callender's, Red Lobster, Ruby's, etc., etc..
- re: Midlife
You don't say where you're coming from or if you have any control over the schedule, but we drive to Vegas from Sherman Oaks several times a year. We don't bother to eat on the way. Maybe twice we stopped at Donut Man in Glendora (off the 210) for a snack. We leave at 7am, pick up coffee at our local Starbucks, stop at the drive-thru Starbucks in Baker for more coffee, and hit Vegas in time for lunch. If I remember I bring almonds or fruit for snacking in the car. If I had to eat in Baker I might try the old Bun Boy which is now a Big Boy. But really, it's probably just a waste of time and calories.
- re: Debbie W
Original plan to two of us leave from Studio city area nice and early and drive straight through with bagels and coffee. Suddenly we have companions who are very nice but fussy eaters so a stop is now involved. Oh well. Think it will be Mad Greek in Baker. I should be mad by then.
thanks for your advice.
- re: arlene
I guess I don't understand what being a fussy eater has to do with being unable to make it from the SFV to Vegas without stopping for a meal. I'd think if they're fussy then you could have stronger grounds to argue that you shouldn't eat until Vegas - lots of excellent choices for fussy eaters there.

Authentic Food in NC Triangle Area
Anyone...
Pancho Villa on Chatham St. is about as authentic as you can get for mexican food. Speaking spanish is almost a requirement. Their pozole is delicious, and you can get any of their tacos with a variety of meats, including tongue. Then you can always go next door to the mexican grocery store and get a fresh paleta.
There is a new authentic Chinese restaurant in Morrisville called C&T Wok; we ate there tonight and found a traditional Szechuan menu that looks to be fairly authentic. We tried the Pork w/ Szechuan Radish Soup and the water-boiled beef (classic szechuan dish) and both were excellently done. I (the eastern counterpart) feel that this restaurant may become my favorite Chinese place in the triangle area, but will have to try more from it before I make that decision.
You could also check out Coquette in North Hills. Where are some places that make their own pasta and do it well? Does Bella Monica? I would have to add Watts Grocery for local sourcing (although several places do that) and Neil's for making his own Pastrami/Corned Beef. I guess what may need to be answer is what is meant by authentic? Are we speaking strictly ethnic cuisine?
Clyde Coopers in Raleigh has good BBQ. Indian well you can take your pick just not Azitra. Saffron, Udupi, Sitar and Mint all seem to get good followings. You can go with Locopops for something different. Don Jose is one outlet in Chapel Hill, but there are several Taco trucks and quite a few places located in Durham that I'm sure people will pipe up about. As far as Greek I'm not sure where it goes from being authentic to something you could find at any other Greek place.
I've also happened to have Sushi Tsune. I went there with my sigfig weekly. We were becoming regulars, so (what seemed like) the head waitress was *very* nice to us. She gave quick, quality service and while she didn't talk much, she seemed to have noticed and tried to keep our dinner routines. We also got complimentary mochi ice cream (mmmmmm, i love mochi) and some salad and soup (separate times). The chef, I heard, has only been in the US for 4 years, he's very friendly and a bit playful. We ordered the firecracker roll one time just to try, and asked for it "extra spicy" just to be mischievous. He asked if we were sure and played around with us a bit. Sitting at the bar is definitely enjoyable if you are good at conversation. The guy is cool. It's a shame it's not opened between 2 and 5? I think (it's been a while), 'cause I would definitely like to go for a light supper thing sometimes, seeing as how my schedule doesn't really allow much time for dinner anymore.
- re: applegravity14
sorry for spamming, I just realized I haven't really recommended anything....the Uni, like the OP said, is awesome. Nice and creamy, served at the right temperature for me, which is room temperature or a bit under. Another favorite of mine is the Hamachi, which I love and like to order in most sushi restaurants. This one served fresh hamachi every time, very buttery and delicious. The salad is ok, the dressing makes it a lot better. The tempura is light and not too oily, which i appreciate, being someone who can't stand grease; they've had their off day, though, but most of the time, it's pretty good about having a light batter. As for the udon, I agree with the OP, and I'd like to add that I really liked the accompanying spice jar thing, with some chili peppers and black sesame seeds.
I really liked the Caldo de Res (beef soup). I've been wanting to try Caldo Camaron (shrimp soup), but they've been out every time I've gone back there. It seems like they have it on Thursdays, so if anyone gets to try, tell me if you like it? I've also had the Pupusa and while the curtido was only ok, the pupusa was made fresh, like everything else I've had there. It was very nice and hot, with that crunchy crust on the outside. yumyum. I've had a bit of a problem at first, though, 'cause the staff doesn't seem to speak much english, if at all. But a little research or a background in spanish will not disappoint you. :)
Hmm...I had the costilla (ribs) and I don't think I like it very much, but I'm not the greatest judge of how it's supposed to taste, so don't really take my word on it if you've had the dish before and is just looking for a place to eat good food. My friend and I have wanted to try chiles rellenos (stuffed peppers) for so long, but it seems like they only have it on a certain day also. Simply put, the tacos are the best things there, hand down. Sopes, huaraches, etc...are ok, with the huarache being slightly off my list for the beans. Nothing against their beans, since I'm not a beans person and I like the beans there as a side dish, but the huarache was a little too heavy for me.
- re: applegravity14
- re: applegravity14
Can I get a confirmation on this place please? I went in there for the tortillas (which are available down the street at Weaver St. Mkt) and all they had were some trucked in from Ga. Can I purchase tortillas here, is this the right place (Hispano-greek mural on the west side, blue awning)?
My spanish is muy poquito, but tortilla is tortilla, so I don't think that was it.
- re: Big_Mac
- re: brokegradstudent
This article makes reference to a restaurant in your area that makes their own corn tortillas.
After your recommendation of Asian Aroma, my fiance and I went to try it. We second your opinion on the authentic Chinese menu. You never would have been able to tell from outside...we had driven past the place several times in the past and chuckled at the name, but didn't think to try it until reading your post. Being from the West Coast and having lived a big part of my life in Taiwan, I was happy to finally find a place with real Chinese dishes.
The beef noodle soup was very good in my opinion (its main plus being authentic), and the salt and pepper squid was deliciously spicy and salty. There is a Chinese menu but it is also translated into English so that you can order from there too. The dinner crowd was almost all Chinese.
yum yum! :)
Bosphorus in Cary has authentic Turkish food
Unaabi does a pretty good job on Afgan cuisine
- re: blewgo
- re: wallabunny
I haven't had the kababs, but according to the menu they come with rice, a salad and Afgan bread. If you go with someone share the bolanee sampler platter before the kabab. It has two of each bolanee on the menu.
The menu on the web site doesn't completely match the one they give you at the table, but it's close.
- re: blewgo
- re: mikeh
The Bosphorus menu is heavy on kabobs, but they have enough other stuff on the menu to make dining there an adventure. The patlican kizartmasi is one of my favorites. It is breaded, fried slices of eggplant covered with a fresh marinara sauce and surrounded with yogurt and garlic. The tomatoes in the marinara sauce are peeled and seeded. How often do you see that much care taken in food prep? On Sunday evening they have doner kebap which they serve several ways. Yes, it is kebap.
- re: blewgo
EastWestCouple has been to Bosphorus tonight, and have a review to give:
We liked the place almost immediately when we sat down. The restaurant was cozy, nicely decorated, clean, and unpretentious. Our waiter was warm and friendly and made us feel at home. We ordered Cigar Bourek as the appetizer, and the restaurant provided an opener of fresh pide bread with seasoned olive oil for dipping. We have a strong suspicion that this restaurant bakes its own bread, and it's absolutely delicious. I had the Bosphorus Salad, and he ordered the Kofta Kabob. All of it was fantastic! Without going into too much detail, the food can be summed up as being perfectly seasoned, crisp and fresh (the way Mediterranean food should be), aromatic, and delightful to eat. It's all very authentic, and on top of that, it's also done right. Of particular note, the rice pudding is really exceptional. It was brought to us nicely chilled and dusted with nutmeg and ground pistachio. At the end of a rich meal of spiced, grilled meats, the dessert was delightfully refreshing with just the right balance of sweetness without being heavy or syrupy.
The restaurant has a cozy, relaxed "family feel", and in fact, my fiance has spent some time in Turkey and thought it was really like stepping into a neighborhood favorite there. The dining room is tiny, about 10 booths and tables total, with some outdoor seating, all of which only adds to the charm.
We were so impressed that we felt it warranted a recommendation on Chowhounds for everybody. Cheers!
We liked Neomonde in Raleigh for middle eastern food.

Free restaurant take-home treats
I'm researching an article on free, housemade take-home treats that restaurants give diners after having dinner. Anyone know any great ones? They have to be made in-house at the restaurant, and can be a bake mix, a drink mix, a sweet treat etc. And, they CANNOT be in NYC - but any other part of the country is great. If you've gone home with any lovely treats, let me know where and what!

Freshest Fish options?
Looking for a fantastic place to take my father for his 40th?
He loves fresh fish with all his heart. I am interested in places in the Baltimore, Towson, and Annapolis area. But DC isn't totally out of the question.
I heard Black Olive in DC was pretty great, with there preparation of whole fish. Which is fairly intriguing.

"Sorry, we can't find that page" on iPhone and Android
For the last week or two, we've been noticing an extremely large number of errors coming from mobile browsers. Specifically, many iPhones and Androids have been trying to access weird Chowhound URLs with garbled code instead of topic numbers- things like chowhound.chow.com/topics/function%20v() and the like. Unsurprisingly, the weird URLs lead to our "Sorry..." page. The problem appears to be happening a few other places on CHOW as well, such as Recipe pages.
We have reason to believe that some of you are finding these weird links somewhere on the site, suggesting a bug of some kind. Unfortunately, we have not managed to track them down thus far.
To those of you that frequent the mobile version of the site: does this problem sound familiar? Have you noticed an unusual number of "Sorry..." pages when browsing on Android or iPhone? And can you point out the link(s) you clicked to get there?
Thank you in advance for any information you can provide.

Jay Caspian Kang wonders.
These Finals, played by two teams in relatively small television markets, have seen some of the biggest ratings in the history of the league. Localism and its effect on a team has been diluted to the point where there are probably more Kevin Durant fans in Los Angeles than there are total people in all of Oklahoma City. Attendance numbers no longer matter as much to the financial health of a franchise as television deals and whether or not you can fit 500 people into the brewery you build next to the arena. The old methods of fan protest, which mostly involved not buying tickets, have lost much of their power. Even at an event like a rally to bring the Sonics back to Seattle, the focus, at least politically, was on getting people to register their support through social media. The NBA has evolved into an open-access, floating world. Its fans, both domestic and international, have never had more access to the game. A franchise’s ties to its local community and economy have never meant less.
It’s true that more than any other sport, basketball builds fan bases around specific players regardless of geography. But because I was a James Hardin fan, I became a Durant and Westbrook fan (yes, I know that’s backwards). And your town still has to fill the arena. I don’t care how many Shane Battier jerseys are flying out the window in Milford, Connecticut. Ownership’s cavalier (didn’t even mean to do that) attitude towards relocation means they’ll use anything they can to leave any city. A half-empty arena, or an arena filled with opposing fans, is not good marketing or good business.

I wonder if Seattle would step up and support a team if they got another chance.
I hope so. And I think a green and yellow Super Sonics motif with some of the new Nets’ design sensibilities would do wonders for bringing in some new fans in that hippest of lands.

Tell me
What do you see
In these empty hands of mine?
A scar from a drunken night
That time I handed you my jacket
Those times I picked you up off the floor
Tell me
What do you see?
Because I see you slipping into the folds of my hands
Becoming the wrinkles in my fingertips
The stories in my scars
The space between my fingers
So tell me
What do you see
In these empty hands of mine?
Because I see
Lines to a play we haven’t rehearsed
Nails to a home we will build together
And ten reasons to trust
That I will never let you fall.

A. In our hectic world of suicide, depression,
divorce, bitterness & hatred -- happiness, joy & contentment
are precious commodities indeed -- they are constantly being sought after.
1. So many advertisements appeal to our natural
desire to be happy -- promising joy & contentment if we will only try
their product (s).
2. But look around you, the majority of people
have never found true & lasting happiness!
3. As a result, some people have become cynical
about the elusive state of happiness -- denying that such even exists.
a. Is there such a thing as true happiness?
b. Yes -- happiness is a reality & it
can be ours.
c. Not only can Christians be happy, but
B. God expects & commands that his people be
happy:
1. Scriptures:
Rom. 14:17: "For the kingdom of
God is not meat & drink; but righteousness, & peace, & joy
in the Holy Ghost."
Phil. 3:1: "Finally, my brethren,
rejoice
in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous,
but for you it is safe."
Phil. 4:4: "Rejoice in the
Lord alway: & again I say, rejoice."
I Thess. 5:16: "Rejoice
evermore."
I Peter 4:13: "But rejoice, inasmuch
as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall
be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."
2. Paul rejoiced & was full of happiness even
in less than pleasant circumstances. II Cor. 6:10: "As
sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
having nothing, & yet possessing all things."
II Cor. 7:4: "Great is my boldness
of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort,
I
am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
II Cor. 12:10: "Therefore I
take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,
in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
3. Many other passages could be cited, but these
are sufficient to show that of all people, we as Christians should be joyful
& happy.
C. I think we can all agree (based on these passages)
that God expects His children to be happy -- but the question remains:
"How?"
1. Happiness is not something that we stumble on
by accident.
2. Happiness cannot be bought, sold or traded (regardless
of the many sales pitches to the contrary).
3. Fortunately, happiness is not a commodity afforded
only the rich or affluent.
4. Happiness is a state of mind within everyone's
grasp!
5. Many books have been written; all claiming to
contain the formula for happiness & contentment.
a. But the very best advice to be found on
the subject was written years ago & is found in God's Word -- the Bible.
D. In the short time that we have together, I want
us to notice some of God's Rules For Happy Living.
Discussion:
B. God has promised to bless His children abundantly.
Matt. 6:33: "But seek ye first
the kingdom of God, & his righteousness; & all these things shall
be added unto you."
Mal. 3:10: "Bring ye all the tithes
into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, & prove
me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows
of heaven, & pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
enough to receive it."
1. We live in the richest & greatest
nation in the world.
2. Even the poorest American is rich in comparison
to the rest of the world.
C. Sure you have your problems -- we all do --
but let's face it, our blessings far outweigh our burdens.
1. We need to practice the words of the song:
"Count Your Many Blessings."
2. If we will count our blessings, we will
be happier & more thankful to our Heavenly Father.
1. Most of our fears for tomorrow never materialize.
2. We often miss the roses around our feet,
because we are looking for thorns down the path.
B. If people would only learn to live one day at
a time, there would be fewer ulcers, & fewer nervous breakdowns.
C. We have no assurance of living till tomorrow
-- so why not take it as it comes -- one day at a time?
Jas. 4:13-15: "Go to now, ye that
say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, & continue there
a year, & buy & sell, &, & do this, or that."
1. If we would only learn this we would be
much happier.
Lk. 6:38: "Give, & it shall
be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, & shaken together, &
running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure
that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
1. Some go through life always expecting
to receive from others, but they never give a thing.
2. Acts 20:35: "I have shewed you
all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, & to
remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed
to give than to receive."
I Thess. 5:17: "Pray without
ceasing."
Phil. 4:6: "Be careful for nothing;
but in every thing by prayer & supplication with thanksgiving
let your requests be made known unto God."
Col. 4:2: "Continue in prayer...."
B. Every Christian should reserve time during the
day to thank God for his many blessings & to ask for his guidance.
1. When a husband & wife do not talk
or communicate we know that something is wrong -- when God's children do
not communicate with him, something is wrong!
C. Prayer is a vital ingredient in God's Recipe
for Happiness.
A. All things have a place in life.
1. Some things are far more important than
others.
2. We must learn to keep important things
in first place.
B. Many things in life are important, (some more
than others).
1. Our Lord stressed priorities in Matthew 6:33.
2. Spiritual matters must take priority over
material things.
C. One cannot be truly happy until he learns to
count the true value of things -- & put first things first.
Phil. 4:7: "And the peace of God,
which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts & minds through
Christ Jesus."
B. We (as Christians) of all people have every
reason to be at peace with ourselves -- we have peace with God.
Phil. 4:8: Finally, brethren, whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things
are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there
be any virtue, & if there be any praise, think on these things."
B. There should be no room for trashy evil thoughts
in the mind of a Christian.
B. Many think it's terrible to laugh & joke
(there are times when it is inappropriate). 1. Scriptures:
Proverbs 17:22: "A merry heart
doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones."
Rom. 12:15: "Rejoice with them
that do rejoice, & weep with them that weep."
2. Only when we learn to laugh & cry with one
another can we truly be happy & "bear one another's burdens."
Phil. 4:4: "Rejoice in the Lord
alway: & again I say, rejoice."
B. As we already mentioned, we have so much to
be happy about.
C. Let us show the world that Christians are truly
happy people!
1. We are weak, but our Father is strong.
2. Matt. 10:28: "And fear not them
which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear
him which is able to destroy both soul & body in hell."
Phil. 4:13: "I can do all
things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
B. With God on our side, what, or who do we have
to fear?
1. But we must let God have full control
of our lives.
2. This is the only way to find true peace
& happiness.
3. David spoke of this in Psalm 23.
B. Until we truly let Christ be Lord (master) of
our lives, we will not, we cannot be truly happy!
C. There can only be one person in the drivers
seat.
Conclusion:
A. Yes, Happiness can be found!!!
1. Not in drugs, alcohol, or material wealth.
2. True happiness can be found only in obedience
to God's will.
a. Only when we submit to God's Word can
we have true peace & happiness.
B. Have you found the happiness that God intended
for us to know?
1. Just remember, happiness is a habit -- a by-product
of right thinking & living.

Go down, Moses ….
After years in the wilderness, a journey that began in 1994*, 44 Upper Cross Road reports an executed contract. Twenty-three acres and a disposable house, asking $8.499 million, and while it hasn’t closed yet, the Promised Land is in view. How many official days on market? It’s been on and off, but active days, not counting those when a buyer could have just called up the owner and revived it, number in the thousands – probably close to 9,000.
Brother Gideon will I’m sure feel a twinge of nostalgia seeing this go because it was first listed for sale when he was just setting forth on his brilliant career and now, sniff, it will be gone, surely imparting a faint sense of mortality to the poor guy. Nothing lasts forever.
* Gideon corrects me: his memory places this disaster beginning in 1990.
7 Responses to The oldest listing in Greenwich has a contract!
Was this the property that had the monster home rejected by the conyers farm board??
It was one floor, 35,000 sq.ft, bowling alley, nail salon, you get the picture.
Just to think, in the early 80′s Brant was selling 10 acre lots for 750,000
Even harder pill to swallow is that his daddy once owned 1500 acres, which he gave to Peter.
Can you imagine what it would be worth today!!!!!!!!!!!
(Yes, less than 7 years ago, but still, come on!)
The property taxes are $81K a year, so the seller pissed away over $1mm over the life of the listing!
If memory serves, Rosensteil owned the 1500 acres, his heirs sold it to Petey, not the father, and Petey hired the lovely and talented Joan Caldwell to lobby the subdivision through the town.
Were lots really going for 750K in the early 80s in Conyers Farm? Was this a good deal then?
An ok, the dad just gave him the print biz
And yes, the lots were 750k a pop
One of my clients bought 3, (29.85) acres to be exact
He lives on converse lake, north gate
He confirmed that price for many a times….damn him!
Why didn’t this piece of shit sell? Certainly relative to the assessment it looks like a bargain.
I enjoyed the listing photo’s, especially the young lass with a horse marked as “exterior front”, since there was no architecture or landscape gracing that photo , I was curious how often young women are sold as chattel property in Greenwich real-estate deals?

the education gradient in a new minnesota poll
some fresh locally grown data via the strib's minnesota poll, conducted last week:some fresh locally grown data via the strib's minnesota poll, conducted last week:
the poll of 1,042 minnesota adults includes some useful information on loss in wages and benefits, support for president obama's economic policies, and subjective financial well-being. with regard to the latter, the education gradient shown above caught my eye.
about 56 percent of college grads considered their financial situation to be good or excellent, relative to about 35 percent of those who had not attended college. about 9 percent of college grads considered their financial situation to be poor, relative to 21 percent of those with some college, and 26 percent of those with no college.
i didn't graph it, but there's also an intriguing age story here that's likely bound up with the education results. relative to every other age group, those aged 35-44 were far more likely to rate their financial situation as good or excellent (51 percent) and less likely to rate their situation as poor (13 percent).

closed-circuit guitar post
my dobber's been down the past week, so i retreated to the seventies station this weekend and made a li'l joyful noise. it took me back to the school lunchroom -- especially the intro riff and cover image of a shirtless albino man with mutton chop sideburns, red lipstick, diamond necklace, and a prominent mole. anyway, i loved the riff to free ride, but never took the time to suss it out. the original guitarist is surely featured on the mount rushmore of 70s guitar: either rick derringer, ronnie montrose, joan jett, or brother johnny -- i'm betting on derringer.
the tab below isn't much help, but there's some fine youtube instruction available.

glaucoma
there are more tests to be done and i'm not in the later stages, so i shouldn't be going blind anytime soon. and, i'm honestly a little relieved to learn why i've been having so much trouble seeing and working. my grandmother had glaucoma, so i sort of know the drill. i'll be exploring all sorts of treatments with lasers and eye drops this summer, though i'll likely steer clear of the tetrahydrocannabinol.
the released: a new frontline doc on mentally ill former prisoners
via susan tucker at the open society institute:via susan tucker at the open society institute:
The Released a new FRONTLINE/PBS documentary, will be broadcast and made available online starting Tuesday, April 28th at 9pm est.
This documentary promises to be as powerful and disturbing as The New Asylums, also from MeadStreetFilms, where we saw seriously mentally ill men in cages receiving “therapy” and being shuttled back and forth between a maximum security prison in Ohio and the state’s hospital for the criminally insane. And we came to understand the genuine complexity of their situations and yearned for more equally complex and humane responses.
The Released follows some of the same men featured in the first film who were subsequently returned “to the community” -- but more often to the street -- and in some cases have ended up back in prison.
We’re pleased that OSI has been able to support dissemination of the film and development of a, highly informative website... Similar support was awarded for The New Asylums (which can still be seen on Frontline’s website) and before that for The Exonerated by director Ofra Bikel, also shown on PBS.

minneapolis skid row, c. 1960
i've read some good histories on minneapolis' old gateway and skid row, but this is the first film i've seen from the period. it isn't pretty, but the footage is amazing. the narrator is johnny rex, proprietor of the sourdough and king of skid row.
flyer for a yard sale, minneapolis 1980
via mnspeak and stuff about minneapolis:via mnspeak and stuff about minneapolis:
this sign dates to the early days of the incarceration boom. with so many going to prison each year, i'm surprised that i've never seen such an advertisement before. more typically, i see divorce cited as the reason that a car or household goods must be sold.
perhaps prison is too stigmatized to make for an effective marketing pitch. note that the parenthetical -- (for tax evasion) -- appears to have been added after the rest of the sign was prepared. this presumably destigmatizes the seller so as to overcome customers' fears of visiting a prisoner's home. it could also draw buyers, signalling that high-quality goods will be available at the sale. that said, bernard madoff would have a tough time attracting customers if he offered a full-disclosure parenthetical: (for securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, perjury and making false filings with the SEC). i suspect he'll use christie's instead.

work-family balance
as elsewhere, female labor force participation has risen among touring bands. and at least some of the parents are now bringing the kids to coachella. think about it: relative to the average nine-to-fiver, these parents get to spend a lot of time with their kids.
when i was a feature writer in the skinny-tie era, i didn't see many kids backstage. i once asked a musician about a song called tape my wife to the ceiling, which i assumed expressed some kink way beyond my comprehension. instead, he told me it was about wishing that everything at home could stay exactly as it is, while the band was doing the road thing -- after the tour, he just wanted to remove the tape, take the family down from the ceiling, and resume the good life he'd left. he knew the idea was ridiculous (hence the title), but mid-sized bands had few other good options for traveling with their families at the time. a decade or so later, alan and mimi (and superstars with greater resources, i'm sure) made family inclusiveness a pre-condition for touring.
it will take a generation or so to determine whether road life is actually good for kids, but i don't think they're suffering. if one judges by low and cloud cult, the music doesn't suffer either.

depression blogging and the sociological imagination
nice. there are clear elements of both group therapy and personal journaling in such blogs, carried along by the writer's honesty and wit. i'd guess that depressed bloggers generally have the same sort of motivations and procreant impulses as non-depressed bloggers, but i really have no empirical basis to make such a claim.
i expect we'll be seeing a spate of articles in coming years on such basic questions. first, there will be cross-sectional studies asking whether bloggers are more X than non-bloggers (where X=depressed or sleepy, dopey, happy, or bashful). second, there will be longitudinal pre- and post-test studies that ask whether the experience of blogging makes bloggers more or less X at time t than at time t-1 (perhaps relative to a matched comparison group of non-bloggers at t and t-1). third, we'll likely see an event history approach to blog duration, complete with time-varying covariates (e.g., work hours, family changes, grumpy commenters).
on balance, i'd bet that most of this research will show that persistent bloggers realize some sort of benefit from the experience. more personally, i see blogging as a restorative tonic for the sociological imagination, as it gets me writing and thinking about a diverse array of people and events. kieran, as usual, put this best:
As a thing for academics to do, writing a blog can be an endless black hole of self-absorbed wittering — or, it can cultivate a capacity to stay interested in things and to write about them fluently in the course of everyday life. One model can be found at the back of The Sociological Imagination, where Mills has an essay called “On Intellectual Craftsmanship.”
blogging may not have honed my intellectual craftsmanship, but i know it helps me maintain the "playfulness of mind" mills described -- and playfulness comes in handy when our research takes us to depressing places.

Augusta-area sportsmen sometimes feel left out when Georgia's Wildlife Resources Division schedules its periodic public meetings to seek opinions on how best to manage the state's hunting programs.
Many past meetings - on topics such as deer hunting with dogs and waterfowl management - have been held in other parts of the state, but one of eight planned January hearings will be held much closer to home, in Thomson.
What's unusual this year is that there is no specific legislation or controversial rule change pending to incite public turnout and comments. But it will be an opportunity to meet state and regional game managers, and to ask questions on any topic you wish.
"You can bring up anything you want," said Melissa Cummings, communications director for WRD. "It's basically open season on anything you want to ask or talk about."
The meetings are the beginning of a yearlong effort to fine tune and sculpt hunting regulations. Topics that surface at these meetings could translate to new rules or regulations by the time hunting season gets under way in fall 2005.
One topic that is almost guaranteed to surface is the controversial restriction placed several years ago on clubs that use dogs to hunt deer. Proposals to decriminalize hunting deer over bait, and longer dove seasons also have surfaced in the past.
Georgia is nearing completion on its first comprehensive deer management plan, which incorporates surveys, biological data and opinions from both hunters and non-hunters to devise strategies for dealing with whitetails in a state where hunting is on the decline.
"I know the deer management plan will be one of the major things everyone will want to discuss," Cummings said, noting that the document is undergoing final changes by a steering committee this month.
The meeting in Thomson will be held at 7 p.m. on Jan. 5, at the Augusta Tech campus in McDuffie County. Everyone is welcome.
Other meeting times and locations are as follows. All meetings are at 7 p.m.
• Monday, Jan. 3: Georgia Wildlife Federation headquarters, Covington, Ga.; and Roquemore Center, National Fairgrounds, Perry, Ga.
• Tuesday, Jan. 4: Coastal Georgia Center, Savannah; White County Courthouse, Cleveland, Ga.
• Wednesday, Jan. 5: Southeastern Technical College, Vidalia, Ga.
• Thursday, Jan. 6: Lee County Library, Leesburg, Ga.; The Forum, Rome, Ga.
THREE DEER, TWO SHOTS: From the deer woods come many fine stories, including one this week from Scott Wingard of Columbia County. He wanted to share the story of how he and his young sons brought home three deer with just two shots - on the boys' first hunting trip.
Wingard was hunting with sons Jackson, 6, and Parker, who is 4.
"Just before dark, we took a small doe," he wrote. Then a huge eight-pointer lumbered into view, and Wingard took that one, too, much to the delight of the boys.
"They were very excited, and expect nothing less on their next hunt," he wrote.
After loading the two deer into the truck, they headed for home, only to collide with a huge doe a few miles from their deer lease.
"The doe was completely intact," Wingard explained, "so we threw her into the truck as well."
MASTER ANGLER: Jewel Jessie of Hephzibah has been an active member and volunteer for many years with organizations including the Fort Gordon Sportsman's Club.
That's why he was honored recently as recipient of the club's 2004 Master Angler Award. Jessie placed first in five tournaments, second in two tournaments and third in two other tournaments.
Jessie's fishing partner, Bob Palagyi, was runner-up, and would have been co-angler except for one tournament when Jessie fished with his brother, winning first place while Palagyi finished second.

The organization tasked with promoting a safe downtown faced blood stains and broken glass Wednesday morning.
Overnight, a burglar shattered a window and ransacked the Eighth Street offices of the Downtown Development Authority, apparently looking for money, officials said.
"I got here at 7:39 a.m., and glass was all over the ground and the blinds were broken and hanging off the door," administrative assistant Sherry Miller said.
The intruder ignored laptop computers and other assorted valuables and took only a bank card that had been canceled long ago.
The burglar apparently got cut on the glass and dripped blood over office papers and furniture. Though no usable fingerprints were found, the blood will be sent to the crime lab, said Robin Ashmore, investigator for the Richmond County Sheriff's Office. It could take more than six months for sample results, he said.
"I have a feeling it was probably some vagrant or homeless person," Investigator Ashmore said. "Several businesses on that block were burglarized in the past."
The authority moved into the offices in September. Executive Director Margaret Woodard said she isn't concerned about the incident.
"These kind of things are going to happen anywhere," she said.
It's no indication that downtown is unsafe, she said.
Even so, Ms. Woodard is using the break-in as evidence that Augusta could benefit from a business improvement district, or BID.
A BID, long sought by downtown economic development officials, is a partnership of property owners that voluntarily pay additional taxes in exchange for services such as added security.

HEAD OF DETECTIVE AGENCY
BARED AS A BRUTE
L. E. Fitzgerald stood before Judge
Heap in Hanson street court today
and explained himself:
"I am the manager of the Hunt,
Shippy & Dorman detective agency.
I have charge of 3Q operatives at the
Royal Tailors' shop during the gar
ment strike"
Miss Ellen Gates Starr of Hull
House and Mrs. Wm. E. Rodriguez,
wife of the 15th ward alderman,
were on hand to testify against Fitz
gerald. Their stories:
Miss Starr: I saw Fitzgerald knock
down onto the sidewalk and beat un
til blood ran two garment workers
named Wiznevsky and Miller. In
neither case had they laid a hand on
him. In both instances it was clear
that the policy of Fitzgerald was to
throw fright into these men who
walked peaceably along the side
walk as pickets.. In other words, Mr.
Fitzgerald is a slugger, a ruffian, a
brutal coward, and may stand as a
typical instance of how violence
through armed guards is being used
to defeat the garment strikers."
Mrs. Rodriguez: "On Oct 18 I
saw Fitzgerald beat a picket named
Atkins at the Royal Tailors' shop,
Polk street and Fifth avenue. At
kins isn't much more than a boy and
weighs 60 pounds less than Fitzger
ald. Atkins had started across the
street. His back was turned. Fitz
gerald leaped on him, wrenched his
arm, flung him in a half circle and
then drove his fist into Atkins' nose,
causing a spurt of blood. It almost
unnerved me. I called to him to
stop. He struck me between the
eyes. I broke my umbrella trying to
defend myself."
Fitzgerald had signed jury waiver
and his hearing on charge of assault
of the pickets was to be heard. He
demanded jury trial and the case was
set for next week.
Other witnesses beside Miss Starr
and Mrs. Rodriguez will be heard on
the work of Fitzgerald and his30'
"operatives."

Activists in Egypt should look to the hippy movement of the 1960s for a successful model in bringing about long-term social change.
Since the establishment of the Kifaya (Enough) movement in 2004, the Egyptian political scene has changed dramatically. If this continues, political resistance in Egypt is likely to become much more dynamic than it has been since the 1952 revolution, which overthrew the monarchy and established a republic.
Movements such as Kifaya, the April 6 youth movement and the national coalition for change headed by Mohamed Elbaradei, have all played their part in making the political life of Egypt less stagnant. They have managed to increase the margins of freedom and push for political reforms and will continue to do so, but they can’t do it alone.
These groups all focus on short-term political gains. Their demands focus on short-term goals – constitutional change, free and fair elections, putting an end to emergency law – but they often ignore the most important element that could drive real change in the future: social change.
With a society that is reversing social progress and embracing conservative values, the drive for democracy and equality may find few supporters. Many in Egypt still do not recognise the equality of women and embrace discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. Some discard democracy and human rights as a western invention and as part of an imperialist agenda. What Egypt needs, rather than a few groups preaching against the current regime and political system, is a durable social movement that decades from now can influence politicians and decision-makers.
Look, for example, at the social and political impact the hippy movement had in the US and, arguably, the entire world. Some argue that America wouldn’t have had a black president if it wasn’t for the social progress and momentum built in the 1960s.
The reason behind the hippies’ success in changing the course of history is not only their anti-war sentiments, care for the environment, or their criticism of middle-class values and big corporate practices. These are values that were all preached by others long before the hippies.
No, what made the hippy movement attract millions of youth in the United States and globally was the subculture to carry their messages, rather than the value of the message itself. Their hip and exotic fashion, music and lifestyle is what appealed to tens of millions of young people confused by the Vietnam War and examining the values of their parents. The new fashions they created, and the focus on art and culture in their movement, made it easier for their message to spread.. Ayman Massoud, the keyboardist of the Arabic rock band Massar Egbari (“Compulsory Direction”), explained to me what they mean by the name of the band. In his view, society draws a compulsory direction for us to take in order to fit society’s idea of what is proper and successful.
“If someone wants to become a drummer, their parents will tell them to finish college first and then they can do whatever they want. But after they finish college, society will force them to find a job and practise their hobby on the side. After that, they will become too drained from their jobs and gradually forget about their old dream,” says Massoud.
Egyptian dissidents don’t have to – and should not – follow in the footsteps of others, but establish a culture that will make it easier to promote their beliefs. I wrote before in Egypt Today about how an underground music scene is emerging in Egypt focusing more on societal issues. This appeals to those who are tired of a pop scene dominated by attractive singers chiming love songs to western beats: music that avoids issues facing Egyptian youth today. This can be the root from which a new subculture can stem.
A movement like this would likely face huge social condemnation. It is inevitable it will be described as a threat to national security by the regime and a threat to society and its values by religious groups, but new ideas and social change are often faced with resistance.
Khaled Diab pointed out in Brian Whitaker’s book, What’s really wrong with the Middle East, that Egypt has a million Mubaraks – meaning that authoritarianism in Egypt exists not only in the political leadership, but also in families, schools and workplaces. As long as people themselves don’t believe in the values of democracy and liberty, no number of political groups lobbying for change will succeed in pushing for reform.

So much is going on in local brewing right now; with new breweries getting started, more and more local product being made. I was amazed to be able to add up a dozen local breweries.
Arthur’s in Hyde Park has noticed, too. By late October, they’ll have only locally made beer on tap in their store. That’s according to their Facebook page:
As a small independent business, we know just how important it is to support other small businesses, especially those here in our own backyards. With Cincinnati’s recent and still growing return to our brewing heritage, Arthur’s Cafe is proud to announce that we will soon begin only pouring draft beer that is brewed right here in cincinnati!
This transition will take place over the next month. We hope you will all join us in celebrating these local brewers at our kick off event on Tuesday, Oct. 23rd. Representatives from our local breweries will be on hand for answer any questions or just chat about great beer!

, but watching his approach you’d never know it.”
Alonso is hitting .260/.348/.364 with two home runs and 18 RBI in 77 at-bats after a slow start. He’s walked more than he’s struck out (12 to 11). The odd thing for a guy with a reputation as line drive hitter? He had no doubles.
Alonso’s bat will get him to the big leagues, but Bell’s been particularly impressed with the strides Alonso made elsewhere.
“The other parts of his game have really improved,” Bell said. “He’s made improvements in all parts of the game. It’s been great for him to get the experience out here. He’s playing better defense, his base-running is better. To me, those are last pieces to getting ready. He’s getting closer and closer.”
Alonoso is going to play Winter Ball in Puerto Rico after the AFL finishes up.

Season.
Progressive Field is a short walk from most of Cleveland's downtown garages and surface parking lots, and it is estimated that more than 30,000 parking spaces are available for most Ballpark events.
With an average of 2.5 persons per car, this means that the available spaces within a 15-minute walk are more than enough to accommodate all the fans attending simultaneous sellout events at Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena.
In order to avoid getting stuck in traffic created by vehicles and pedestrians near Progressive Field, choose an access route which avoids streets bordering the Ballpark (Ontario, East 9th, Carnegie, Huron and Prospect), find a parking garage or surface lot a few blocks away, and walk.
The Regional Transit Authority also offers convenient, affordable service to Progressive Field. The Rapid Transit provides direct service to Tower City, only a short 10 minute walk from Progressive Field through RTA's Walkway to Gateway. For more information, visit RTA's website at.

The Best (and Worst) of 2012
Best movie: The Dark Knight Rises
(2. Killer Joe 3. Looper 4. Prometheus 5. Silver Linings Playbook 6. Lincoln 7. Argo 8. The Cabin in the Woods 9. The Perks of Being a Wallflower 10. Django Unchained)Christopher Nolan's masterful conclusion to The Dark Knight trilogy is not only a step up comparing to previous two movies, it's also one of the most epic and incredibly well made action/adventure films I've seen. Directed with much skill, done with great scope and featuring stellar performances from the cast, the movie has been my number 1 of the year for the last six months and though some films came close, not one of them managed to dethrone it. The film has one stand out performance - that delivered by Anne Hathaway as suave and clever Selina Kyle - but it doesn't have the biggest issue The Dark Knight had - the performance so fantastic it puts everyone in the shadow, making the film uneven. Lead by wonderful Christian Bale, the cast delivers earnest performances that are never overshadowed by the film's incredible action set pieces and breathtaking moments.

Ad for the 50th Street Cinema during its Avant Garde film stage.
a 1972 ad
View link?
The Kings Cinema has been demolished and replaced by a parking garage to serve the adjacent newly built tower block at 250 W.50th Street.
You can’t say it was never a real cinema because it was created from non-theatrical space, so was the Sutton and many other theatres. And as AlAlvarez above stated it did indeed show regular films.
This was never a real cinema, and was created from non-theatrical space to show pornographic movies and to provide a trysting place for male homosexuals. I am appalled to see it listed as a “Cinema Treasure,” since it undoubtedly contributed to the spread of veneral disease and to the start of the AIDS epidemic.
In 1967 as the 50th Street Cinema it showed Avant Garde films starting with the Shirley Clark Documentary PORTRAIT OF JASON.
What was this used for in 1967? Was it X?
The first c/o that I find for a movie theater at this address is dated November 14, 1967. It was an existing building. Seating was 136.

This paper reports on the experiences and challenges related to first exposure to Wiki in an institutional environment. It examines methods of encouraging contribution, installation, configuration and use of the tool. It elaborates on institutional changes and support needed to adopt the tool. BACKGROUND Although itʹs most publicized use is information distribution, the internet has long been an effective medium for project collaboration. Some of the most successful cases have been projects with volunteer members that are open to anyone with enough interest and understanding of the content to contribute. Amongst these projects, known as open source software projects, the Linux operating system is one of the more well-known examples, and Apache, the most used web server in the world, is another. In these instances, the relevant content of a project is organized using some software that facilitates networked collaboration, itʹs published to the internet, and visitors are able to view and join in contributing by virtue of their local internet connection.

If you’ve ever felt that your parents just don’t get what your life is about — or if you’re a parent convinced that your kids don’t appreciate what you’ve done for them — you need to check out Julia Cho’s new play Durango at the Cincinnati Playhouse this weekend. Not only is this a play about strife between generations of a Korean-American family. It’s also a more universal exploration of how parents from any culture yearn for the best for their children and how children need to follow their own paths. (See my review here.)
In the Lee family, proud father Boo-Seng has just lost his job, a fact he can’t bring himself to share with his sons, eager Jimmy and angry Isaac. But he does coax them into a road trip from their Arizona home to Durango in Colorado: Cooped up in a car for a long drive, they cannot contain their strong emotions, and there are many revelations that could lead to greater understanding. But don’t expect this play to wrap events and conflicts up neatly — it’s more like life. You can see the possibilities, but they don’t necessarily arrive in a timely manner. Still, there’s a kind of hope.
Cho is a promising playwright whose work is imaginatively staged in the Playhouse’s intimate Shelterhouse Theatre. You’ll come away from this story thinking about your own parents — or your kids. Get show times and tickets here.
— Rick Pender
A show that's likely to be considered one of the best of the 2009-2010 season is just about over. This weekend offers the final performances of Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati's production of 33 Variations. The intriguing play by Moisés Kaufman is about Katherine Brandt, a musicologist who tries to understand what motivated Beethoven to compose many variations on a simple waltz melody. The action moves back and forth between the 19th and the 21st centuries as the composer and the scholar both race against debilitating health — the onset of Beethoven's deafness and the physical deterioration of Brandt's body from Lou Gehrig's disease..
No bad luck for this Friday the 13th: The Showboat Majestic is presenting The Nerd, a great 1981 comedy by Larry Shue, who also wrote The Foreigner.
There’s a ton of theater this weekend, much of it certainly worth seeing. But if you want to be in the vanguard of theater fans who have seen fascinating work from around the world, you can do that at the Carnegie Visual and Performing Arts Center on Friday (7 p.m.) or Sunday (3 p.m.) when the Covington facility and Cincinnati World Cinema jointly present FELA! directly from the National Theatre in London.
I'm a regular blood donor, so I'm pleased to tell you that you can help out Hoxworth Blood Center and help yourself a little, too, thanks to Cincinnati Shakespeare Company. Starting next week, the company will do its part for Halloween when it presents Giles Davies in a creepy production of Dracula (Oct. 15 - Nov. 7). To set the mood, Cincy Shakes has arranged for a bloodmobile to do a collection in Piatt Park.
Kind of a lazy Saturday. The hustle and bustle around Manhattan’s theater district subsides somewhat on the weekends, at least on Saturday morning before the tourists wake up. Wandered down to 40th Street to browse in the Drama Book Shop, an historic hangout for actors and writers, but a wonderful store for anyone who loves theater. I bought a script for Tracy Letts’ Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, August Osage County, which is coming to southwestern Ohio in September when it will be co-produced by Dayton’s Human Race Theatre and Wright State University.
Other than that excursion, I had a double-header theater day with a matinee of David Mamet’s new play Race in the afternoon and an evening performance of the ’80s Arena Rock musical Rock of Ages in the evening.

Lev Grossman, The Magician King
A few years ago A.S. Byatt wrote a famous critique of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series, dismissing them as “jokey latency fantasies”. In it Byatt argued that unlike works such as Susan Cooper’s The Dark is Rising or Alan Garner’s troubling and often unsettling children’s books which demand children grapple with a world larger and stranger than they had previously imagined, Rowling’s books allow children to fulfil their infantile fantasies of unrecognized importance and power.
Whatever one makes of Byatt’s argument, it’s difficult not to wonder whether her essay played a part in the formation of Lev Grossman’s exuberantly entertaining 2009 novel, The Magicians. At once loving homage and deadly accurate deconstruction, it imagined a world where magic is real, and asked, with considerable sophistication, what it might mean if that particular fantasy came true. And in the process it created something at once strikingly original and deliberately subversive, not just a story about the loss of illusions and the beginnings of adulthood that was simultaneously an exercise in re-enchantment but a exploration of the manner in which power and trauma distort our inner selves.
The Magicians centres on Quentin Coldwater. “Sarcastic and spookily smart”, Quentin is also, as his friend Julia admits to herself at one point, “basically a kind person who just needed a ton of therapy and maybe some mood-altering drugs”. Lonely and isolated at high school, Quentin’s one solace (other than his hopeless passion for Julia) is his absorption in the Narnia-like Fillory novels. Yet when an alumni interview for Princeton turns into an exam for an ultra-secret, ultra-exclusive school for magicians called Brakebills, Quentin finds himself initiated into a world where his oddness is no longer a liability, and where, amazingly, Fillory is more than just a story.
Grossman’s follow-up, The Magician King, begins two years after the events at the end of The Magicians. Quentin is now one of the kings of Fillory. It’s a good life: populated by magical creatures and impossibly beautiful, Fillory is as close to perfection as any place could be. But as Quentin is beginning to realise it’s also a little bit boring. And so, when a carelessly arranged day in pursuit of an enchanted hare ends in tragedy, Quentin decides to embark on a quest. As quests go it’s no big thing, just a trip on a refitted sailing boat to an island in the Eastern Ocean to find out why the inhabitants haven’t been paying their taxes. But for the now-restless Quentin it seems enough just to have a purpose again.
These early chapters unspool with a brisk efficiency, but the novel only really kicks into gear when Quentin stumbles on a golden key, which when used does not transport him somewhere magical, but dumps him and his childhood friend and fellow tetrarch, Julia, back on Earth. Desperate to return, the two of them must navigate a hitherto unglimpsed magical underworld populated by self-trained wizards and witches, and utterly unlike the cosy prep school world of Brakebills, a process that gives Quentin his first glimpse of the price Julia, who was rejected by Brakebills, paid to acquire her powers. But as they discover on their return to Fillory, their experiences on Earth were only the prelude to a much larger and more perilous quest to save not just Fillory, but magic itself.
If much of the pleasure of The Magicians lay in its unfeigned delight in the books from which it drew its inspiration, much of its power lay in the tension between the magical elements drawn from C.S. Lewis and Harry Potter and elsewhere and the restless, dissatisfied and painfully human dramas of its protagonists. For all its playful energy it was ultimately a surprisingly dark book about loss, and failure.
Something similar is true of The Magician King. Once again the book riffs wickedly on the tradition it inhabits, managing to seem as comfortable invoking the secret lore of 1970s role-playing games and Neal Stephenson novels as it is gesturing to Le Guin and Tolkien. And once again it manages the not-inconsiderable feat of managing to be both extremely funny and utterly believable.
Yet it is also a more ambitious book than The Magicians. Moving beneath its surface are a series of deeply disquieting questions about the corrupting nature of power and the theological underpinnings of fantasy worlds such as Narnia. The gods Quentin and his friends glimpse are not benevolent, but cold and distant, while their expressions on Earth are not just capricious but actively malevolent. Certainly it’s safe to say that you’ll never look at Aslan the same way again.
Despite the achievements of writers such as Guy Gavriel Kay and Neil Gaiman Fantasy is a genre that has long struggled to be taken seriously, often treated as faintly ridiculous or an embarrassing overhang from childhood. In The Magician King Lev Grossman demonstrates it is neither, producing a book that does not simply crackle with energy and ideas, but which manages to be at once an inquiry into the underpinnings of the tradition it occupies and a brilliantly eloquent demonstration of its possibilities. The Magician King is not a book for children, or even a book about the stories of childhood for grown-ups. It is quite simply one of the smartest, funniest, most exciting novels you’re likely to read this year.

Charest comes back to laud Bergman at JGH
MONTREAL — Former premier Jean Charest made his first official public appearance since losing the Sept. 4 Quebec election to pay tribute to his former colleague Lawrence Bergman at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH).
The JGH presented the D’Arcy McGee MNA with its highest honour, the Distinguished Service Award, at its 78th annual general meeting.
President Rick Dubrovsky described Bergman as being a tireless supporter of the JGH ever since he was first elected in 1994.
In particular, Bergman was instrumental in obtaining government approval and funding for the major expansion the JGH is currently undergoing.
Last year, the government announced that it is contributing $300 million toward the largest ever addition to the JGH’s patient-care facilities.
Construction continues on the new Pavilion K, a six-storey building that will house emergency and critical-care departments and more general-care beds, among other services. Altogether, the JGH is slated to grow by 40 per cent when work is completed, which is expected to be the end of 2014.
Charest affirmed that Bergman’s intervention was key in persuading him and then-health minister Yves Bolduc and finance minister Raymond Bachand to give the project the green light.
“Those who have had the privilege of working with Lawrence know how determined he can be, how persistent,” said Charest. “But he never raised his voice, he didn’t need to. He was very persuasive.”
Charest, who is expected to practise law in Montreal, said his government’s investment in the JGH “represented the trust we had in him and your community,” and recognition of the exceptional care provided at the JGH.
Charest said he is a JGH patient himself, quickly adding that he’s in fine health.
He also noted that his father-in-law, Philippe Dion, who was a surgeon in Sherbrooke for many years, died at the JGH just over a year ago at age 90. Charest said the family is grateful for the compassion shown to him in his final days.
Also present was the Liberal interim leader Jean-Marc Fournier and National Assembly Speaker Jacques Chagnon. Charest joked that the evening was actually a Liberal party fundraiser.
Bergman said he was overwhelmed by the tribute and that he was proud to have helped the JGH, which he lauded for having been open to every Quebecer since the beginning.
“The JGH represents the finest values of the Jewish people, that of benevolence… Succeeding generations have maintained that tradition, and the JGH is an indelible part of the Montreal landscape,” he said.
The JGH will have to get its finances in order.
Treasurer Gary Wechsler reported that the JGH spent $326.9 million in the current year, leaving it with a deficit of $24.7 million.
The provincial government requires the JGH to balance its budget within two years, Wechsler said, and a plan has been submitted, but no response has been received yet.
Executive director Hartley Stern said the expenditure overrun can partly be attributed to the JGH being “the victim of its own success.”
He said the emergency department is being used by many people who do not live anywhere near the JGH. Polls show that they come there because they think they will get better treatment, he said.

Obama to visit Israel
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will make his first visit to Israel as president in the spring, a White House official said.. have accumulated much evidence that such a weapon is in the development stages.
Kerry said during his confirmation hearings that one of his priorities would be reviving moribund Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and suggested that whatever Israeli government emerged after the Jan. 22 elections would be more amenable to such talks than its predecessor.
Netanyahu, who led the last government, is currently in talks to set up a new one, and has indicated he would prefer a centrist coalition likelier to engage in peace talks than his last government.

It has been a while since I've attended school and it is refreshing to be back in the solace of pen, paper and homework. I have to admit that everything is vastly different from the kind of school I am accustomed to, not just beacause it is an adult school but things work differently from the Philippines. Back in my home country school starts at 7 in the morning and ends half past 4 in the afternoon, which is clearly not the same case here in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The structures and buildings are different too, it is more modern and well built, which is a nice environment for learning. Truthfully I was nervous during the first day of class. I was anxious to meet my classmates but they are a nice lot and now I found myself comfortable around them. I imagined my teacher to be strict and and someone who plays by the book but upon meeting Jody I honestly thinking that she is cool and very helpful. So far the lessons that we have covered got the gears in my head turning again. The topics are considered to be refreshers since those were already taught in high school. I am looking forward for more writing assignments, especially the the lyrical one stated in the course outline.
One must be determined in order to pass. I will set my priorities straight and focus. I must attend every class so that I won't miss anything and by not missing anything I won't have a hard time in catching up. I will pay attention to the lessons and actively participate in class, that way the piece of information will be retained in my mind. Taking down notes is helpful and will save me the trouble when studying alone. It will also keep things organized. I shall change my ways and never procrastinate. If a task is given I should carefully go through it and don't waste my time in idle thinking. Completing homework and making sure it is done before it is due is a good practice as well. Hopefully I'll follow through the things I have listed and acquire enough credits and be a successful student. It is better late than never.

My first immpressions of this class was how diverse it was. It's a big change than from what I am used to from highschool but I knew what to expect. The school is very small but I like it in a way. Its easier to get to know people and easier to learn. So far I find the work we are doing in class rather easy. Probably becuase english is one of my stonger subjects and I have already completed a grade 12 english course. So far the course outline seems to be intersting. I am looking forward to the research project mostly.
This semester I plan to come to every class to ensure that I succeed. My biggest problem in the past was attendence. Also, handing in all of my homework and assignments to ensure I receive the highest marks possible. The higher my marks the better chances I have for being accepted into the University Of Winnipeg.

Having been in and out of school for 10 years I would have to say my best experience so far has been with RETSD. I didn't know what to expect on my first day of school. I like that it's small so you don't have to compete too much for help. I especially like the fact that the teachers actually help you. At JobWorks the English teacher didn't help me much. English certainly isn't my strong point. I enjoy writing but I have a hard time puttung pen to paper. Attending class four mornings a week instead of two I've noticed the class moves at a faster pace. Hopefully I can get most of my assignments completed before the end of the course.
There are always bumps along the road to success. In the past I have given up my studies because of work or illness due to my pregnancy. This year I plan to strive to achieve my diploma in June. With finances being tough and having a little one to care for at home that hasn't detered me from completing my assignments. Yes, they may be late but they will be handed in.

My first impression of this, I thought "yay!! the computer room!!" I say that because we can have our own space in a way instead of awkardly starring at each other, plus we can go on the computer...of course. I was surprised there was actually alot of students despite there was barely any last year when I attended here at the Center. My classmates ALL seem to be nice and smart! I know this because Jody had us in group discussions so that gave a me a better chance to get to know them. And as for Jody, she`s a great teacher just how most of her old students told me she was. I like the way she teaches. So far we learned about editing and revising our work, writing variables and reading strategies. Though this course is very fast paced I feel like at the same time I've learned alot.
For me to succeed in this class, I think attendance is important and most importantly is to understand what is being taught to us so it makes are assignments and homework easier to do.

My first impreshion was that this was not your average school, classroom and bathroom location. The first day went really well though, all the other students seem really nise and all have a common goal to better their lifes.
In order for me to be a succesful student I will have to apply myself and complete all assingments. Also I will have to do a better job of completing my blogs!

My first impression of of the class is being very quiet. I was worried of being judged, because I was worried that I was not smart enough. My concern was that the classmates might make fun of me. My other impressions were how many students were and what ages groups there were . I wondered if the other students were nervous and excited like myself. I noticed a few other students sitting at the front with me on the first day.

I like this class. I find it's a very easy going envoriment,we go at a good pace. I like my classmates luckily they're all easy going and a funny group. I like that class kind of down sized because it's eaiser for us to get one on one. Our teachers cool and easy going. I am not worried when i have to ask her for en extention on my work. she also makes sure that everyones in the same spot or close to,which makes it easier not to fall behind. I am trying my hardest to keep up with the work and handing things in on time. I think if i just show up and do my best I'll be successful in this class. I've learned to ask for help or ask questions if I am not understanding something.

Part one - My first impression was that I thought that it would be easier then math. I guess I was wrong! The way I see it now being back in school these passed few weeks is that there is much more thinking involved. The room and building is easier to settle into due to the small classes. My classmates are very entertaining for the most part,They also can be alittle distracting when I am quietly working and deep in though. I like that the teachers they are more hands on help. While i was in high school i didn't get the kind of support and help that I do get here.I am very grateful for that.Helps me understand more of what I am learning.
Part 2 - I will try my best to attend my classes and do all the work that is being asked to do. I will ask for help when and if I need to. I will be more of a class participant. I hope to work on my social skills and not shy away from involving myself in class discussions.

This being my first time here, I was pleasantly surprised. The building is smaller and very comfortable with up to date equipment. The smaller classes makes for more one on one help with the teachers. Since I have been out of school for so long, I'm finding it a complete change of pace. With having only two subjects at this time, I'm not being over whelmed. The other students are so much younger but nice and understanding of someone so much older than them trying to learn the same stuff they are. I enjoy the comments and joking around they do to lighten the mood when needed. The teachers are very understanding and helpful with all the questions being asked.. Since I want my Gr.12 diploma I am going to try to do everything required of me and learn. I will try to show up for every class, on time and be prepared with assignments completed to the best of my ability.

When I walked in I knew it was gonna be different than highschool. The other school I went to was like this but it was indepandent. I like how you have more class time to do an assignment and the smaller classes. This is the most fun and worry free for school that i have been. I like that the location of the building is close and is in Transcona. I enjoy the work that we do its very easy. The teachers are awsome my favorite to be honest would be english its more relaxed.
This semester I'm going to attend school everyday unless there is an emergancy. I will do my work and hand it in. I have a tendacy of forgetting to hand in my work so I'll have to be reminded. I will do my assignments to the best of abilty that I can.

I like the way adult classes are conducted as oppose to how high school was. This is my second time here except I didn't go past a week the first time. The work seems pretty straight forward so far and I can only expect the work to be building on the skills. I like that the teachers aren't too anal about the assignments and are understanding towards outside variables & the fact that not everyone goes at the same pace. The smaller building makes it much easier to find your way around which is always nice, KE was very confusing and Miles Mac was untill I went there for a while. My class seems good so far, everyone is nice and friendly which makes going back to school easier. I just have to force myself to stick to it, try not to miss any classes and not get behind in work and I think I'll be able to succeed.

This is the first time I have taken classes at this school, and the first time I have been an adult student. I was really surprised when I showed up to our English class for the first time a few weeks ago; I couldn’t believe how big our classroom was. I remember years ago when this school was an elementary school and did not except the building to be the way it is. A few days ago I was actually talking with mom about the building because I was wondering if there was a gym here and where would it be? At first I’ll admit that I was not looking forward to doing blogs one bit, none of my other teachers that I’ve had throughout my life have ever done anything like this. After the test blog we did I’m a lot more open to the concept. This semester I will try my best to not fall behind in the assignments given. In high school it was too easy to fall behind and not care enough to get caught back up. I chose to be an adult student, so I know because it’s my choice I will put much more effort into the course. So far I really like the teacher style that Jody has and the twists she has on here assignments. For example our last assignment we were able to choose the article we wanted to work with rather than given one that might not interest us. I continue to look forward to the rest of the course and the work included.

Alright, well my honest first impression of this class (and I’m going to be brutally honest here) was that I hate it. I, with a burning passion hate English because of the amount of writing. Worst of all opinion writing, I’ve always thought “why should I write about my opinion when my opinion doesn’t matter?” Lucky for Jody, who my first impression was that she looks incredibly cool for an English teacher, my first opinion of the English class was wrong. Everyone in the class seems like decent people who are there with honest intentions which I greatly appreciate and the work isn’t immensely difficult. Writing is by far not a skill I possess and I truly miss novel studies but my gut tells me I can accomplish this. I can succeed in the subject that I’ve failed a number of times. It’s quite baffling to me that only two years of being out of school has made such a difference in moral when it comes to education. I’m not sitting in this class because I have to, I want to be here. This time will be different from the other three times I’ve attempted to get my diploma; yes three times I have dropped out. No more of that however, I’m going to complete this class if it kills me. Even if I have to cut my hours at work, I will prioritize my education and respect what it can do for my future. My ass will be in that chair every class, and assignments will be completed. They may not be on time but that something I have to work on. This is a goal I am determined to accomplish, and ill do anything to achieve it.

^ That isn’t a question, it’s an imperative statement. Sometimes, first impressions lead to misconceptions.
Anyway.
1) ‘Tis been nearly half a decade since I last set foot in a classroom, and I’m genuinely happy to be back. I suppose that speaks volumes of my altered state of mind. If you study the principles of learning, which interest me (along with the psychological concept of “flow”), you’ll find that one must be inclined to learn in order to do so. Now, you’re probably thinking, “nah, ya think?” It’s like saying, “you have to want to make a purchase before you fist over the cash.” Granted, this is all rather eye-rollingly obvious, but my point is, it explains the innumerable droves of tykes in schools today who are blatantly uninterested in anything but recess, how fast a clock’s hands move, and the looming weekend’s sleepover. Like them, I once saw little to no value in being all but forced into congregating like sheep in a room with bad chairs and appalling decor to be educated in things I knew I’d never remember anyway, things I didn’t give a hoot about. Thus, any attempts anyone made at teaching me in this frame of mind were utterly fruitless, and so I was simply wasting everyone’s time and money, including my own, which, to be honest, I think is pretty funny, although I’m aware that I shouldn’t, but I don’t care. You can easily guess what ended up happening. There is a time for departure, even when there is no certain place to go, but I basically vanished from the scholastic milieu on a whim. Um, well, it was more like the expedient path to spare my sanity… Okay, now, that’s cryptic, but it’s a sleep-inducing tale I’m sure you’ve no interest in whatsoever. Since then, I’ve come to realise that the pursuit of knowledge is an unabashed declaration of ignorance, which the spirit of inquiry haunts. In other words, because I venture a guess that you have no idea what the hell I’m talking about at this point, I’m much more interested in learning these days because of my seemingly insatiable, mostly selfish, desire for knowledge.
This school’s environment seems far more hospitable than... uh, other...ones. Haha, don’t wanna go naming names now. In particular, the people, lack of stairs and eyeball-explodingly aggravating dissonance are things I really like. The small yet efficient space and horseshoe construction in which everything is just a walk around the corner away is great. I used to loathe how getting from one class to another in-between periods in high school was like a flippin’ hiker’s commute. Also, those touch screen Smart Board thingies in, like, every room are pretty damn swish. More money to spend due to the smaller space? I dunno. I think my peers are actually pretty cool people, and given my general dislike of humanity, you can take that as a compliment. :3 I’ve always felt that the best teachers would be people who didn’t like school in their youth, because they’d know what I couldn’t care less about, and be able to teach us, y’know, right; Jody is a living example of this, and I’m happy to know teachers like her even exist. In my experience, you’d either get some snooty cur who took themselves too seriously, or a cloudcuckoolander who was completely out of touch with reality. Here we have a teacher who likes Coca-Cola and omggoodmusic (:’D) who apparently didn’t blacklist me after I wrote her an entire paragraph about how I feel like one of the Angry Birds when dealing with people I deem stupid. So she’s obviously got a good sense of humour. Which I think more teachers need. Desperately. Speaking of the autobiography, it was slightly challenging for me to write, because, well, I’m not a narcissist. I obviously enjoy writing, just... not about myself. EVER.
There’s great irony in the fact that we’ve all decided to be here ourselves, and thus are more focused, determined, and motivated than we ever were in our teens, and yet, the most laid-back, easy going mellow vibe permeates our days. That’s probably one of the best things about being here, really.
2) You need something in order to gain something. I require nothing to succeed except my strong desire to do so. I don’t have time to be defeated.

This is my first time here at Mcleod education center. I went to Transcona for about a month when I was 19. This school is a pretty good size, the classrooms are kind of small for the amount of students they have in them. Mostly everybody is friendly. Jody is a good teacher she explains things very well so that I think everybody understands. I’m not to fond of the work we have done or are going to do but English is not my favourite subject. My first impressions of this class was man I don’t like English but its not as bad as I remember. To ensure I succeed as an adult student I’m going to try and make it to every class so I know whats going on. I’m going to apply myself to my work especially English as that is my weakest subject. I will ask questions when I need help instead of being quiet. Most importantly though im just going to succeed because its something I want to do for myself.

Yesterday I did some research of little Thomas Naughton. He was born in 1892 and died in 1893. I found the family still living in North Braddock PA. Although the mothers name listed on the death certificate entry was listed as Norah Thornton, on the 1900 census it was listed as Katie. At that time she had listed five children and one deceased. They were Maggie, Bartley, Matt, Marie and possible Eduora (?) The parents are 36 and 35 at that time.
In the 1910 mothers name is Katharine, then Margaret, Bartley, Matthew, Marie, Helen and John. John is the youngest and 9 years old. Appears that Eduora is Helen.
I have not found them in the 1920 census, as of this time. I did do a search in 1930 for Bartley, being an unusual name and found him married and living with his wife an children in Michigan. The parents and all children were born in PA. More research to be done. I have to get up my butt and send for the documents of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.
I found them in the 1920 census. The girl name in that one is Helinora, I suspect it is Ellenora.....just a thought. Bartley is married with one child and living in Wilkinsburg PA, which is near North Braddock. In the 1930 census it appears that the father Patrick has died and Katie and a few of the adult children are living still in North Braddock.
North Braddock is a economically depressed town now, I have not found any Historical Society and the local library does not seem to have any information. They have old newspapers but their microfilm reader is broken and they do not have the money to repair it. That is really sad.

In the 1910 census I found a woman named Theresia Rauscher living with Charles and Barbara Stick living in Millvale PA. Barbara was the daughter of Anton Sperl and Katharina Rauscher Sperl. I have been puzzled by Theresa for a few years. I was sure she was related, but how???
Yesterday I searched Ancestry for Theresa Rauscher and came up with a few surprises. In 1902 I found a Baltimore Passenger List, dated 2 May 1902. The main person was Elizabeth Rauscher, age 58 from Rosshaupt, Bohemia. Next was Johann 32, Anna 29, Theresa 10, Antonia and Margaretha both 4, and Anna age 2. Elizabeth is listed as a widow, but I can not read the information for Johann and Anna. But my theory is that Johann is the son of Elizabeth and Anna his wife and the children are theirs.
The interesting part is they are from the same town as Anton Sperl and his wife Katharina Rauscher. The destination lists Millvale PA and the relationship of brother in law with the name Sprool.
Searching more in Millvale I came across a listing for Frank Rauscher b. 1833 in Austria and his daughter Anna. There are two conflicting reports about the daughter Anna. In the 1910 census it lists her as age 10, but underneath is appears that she is 50. That age would fit in with her fathers age of 72. Frank emigrated in 1900 and I did not find him on the 1900 census. On the Mira code index of 1910 it lists Frank and Anna age 50.
Katharina’s death certificate Frank Rauscher is given as her father with mother unknown. This information was given by John Sperl her son and my husbands grandfather. My theory on this is that after Franks wife died he and his daughter emigrated to Millvale PA USA. Did John know his grandfather? I have not found a death date for Frank or Anna.
Is Anna Rauscher, Katharina Rauscher Sperl Nosseck sister. Anna would have been born about 1860 and Katharina was born in 1864. My best bet would be the family cemetery, St Anthony’s in Shaler Township, PA except for the fact that the cemeteries records were all destroyed in a fire and the only records they have are from the names on the tombstones.
Katharina’s middle initial is T, could that be Theresa and is it the name of her mother?
This comment has been removed by the author.
I had to amend my previous post. I theorize that Anna could be Katharina's sister and Elizabeth could be Katharina's sister in law.
Happy Hunting, you have a lot of information...Mary

In today's market, where in certain areas, there could be several listings in the same condo complex or subdivision, a seller will need to make his property "stand out" from the others. This is especially important if ou really want to sell your property quickly. First impressions of a property are often lasting impressions for a buyer.
All sellers want their property to show well. If your vacant property has been on the market awhile and has had few showings, you might want to consider doing a little "staging." Vacant properties do not always give the buyer a true feeling of what the home could be. Staging is becoming popular as more sellers are recognizing that buyers sometimes prefer to see what the property will look like after they move in. Due in part to the Internet, buyers have more opportunities to "look" at a property before they call their Realtor to schedule a showing. They are relying more and more on photos and virtual tours to narrow their choices of what properties they will actually want to see.
Most people would rather walk through a furnished home than wander through empty rooms. Often they have difficulty trying to picture how their furniture would look in each room. Keep in mind, there is a difference between touring a furnished property and viewing a home that has too many personal items in it, making the buyer feel like they are intruding. Clutter is never good! Remove most of your family photos, your children's artwork and your teacup collection. Leaving a few items will help a buyer to visualize living there.
Some sellers will want to hire a professional to "set the stage" for the potential sale of their home. Others will want to do it themselves. Either way, with a little creativity, some furniture and accessories, you can create a first and lasting impression of your property that could result in the purchase offer you've been waiting for!

Dynamic new outfield has Braves feeling chipper
Torch being passed from Jones to Upton brothers, Heyward
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- When the 2012 season concluded, Braves fans regretfully watched Chipper Jones disappear into the horizon and begin his life in retirement.
Over the course of the four months that followed, they saw their team's future brightened by the creation of an outfield trio that could energize Atlanta and the baseball world for at least the next three seasons.
Braves general manager Frank Wren progressed through the early portion of the offseason determined to pursue free agent B.J. Upton and interested in the D-backs possibly trading Justin Upton. Adding one of these five-tool outfielders alongside budding superstar Jason Heyward seemed quite attractive.
Adding both seemed to be unrealistic. If nothing else, it was just something fun to talk about after the Braves signed B.J. Upton to a franchise-record $75.25 million contract in November. But as it turned out, that was just the start of the fun for Wren, whose patience and aggression proved beneficial when he landed Justin Upton in a seven-player trade with the D-backs on Jan. 24.
Wren entered the offseason looking for two outfielders and exited with three superstar-caliber outfielders who can frustrate opponents with their rare speed-power combination on a nightly basis.
"These guys are up there, talent-wise, with anybody I've ever seen," former Braves outfielder Ron Gant said. " To have all three outfielders who can possibly drive in 100, possibly hit 30 [home runs] and possibly steal 30 [bases], you don't see that very often. I think these three guys can do that. The potential is there."
There is tremendous potential as the Braves enter the 2013 season with three outfielders who are 28-and-under. At the same time, there are questions about whether each of them will live up to the expectations they face.
B.J. Upton, the oldest member of this trio, has hit .242 with a .316 on-base percentage over the course of the past four seasons. The athletic center fielder has also increased his home run total and recorded at least 30 stolen bases each of the past four seasons.
Even while hitting .246 with a .298 on-base percentage for the Rays this past year, B.J. Upton finished two homers shy of notching just the 61st 30-30 season in Major League history.
"The potential is enormous," former Braves first baseman and Tampa resident Fred McGriff said. "It's just a matter of, if [Braves hitting coach] Greg Walker and others can get it out of him. He could easily be a .280-.290 hitter. He shouldn't strike out 160 times or so. It's just a matter of, if he's going to continue to make adjustments. His last month and a half last year, he was awesome. If you get it all out of him, you've got a great ballplayer."
At this point last year, Justin Upton was considered a MVP-caliber player. But the optimism he created while hitting a career-best 31 homers with 21 stolen bases in 2011 was dampened as he battled a thumb injury and hit .280 with 17 home runs this past season. The .785 OPS he compiled during this "career-worst" season ranked as the 15th-best among qualifying National League outfielders.
Heyward began living up to his tremendous expectations as he hit .269 with 27 home runs, an .814 OPS and 21 stolen bases this past season. Still just 23, the Gold Glove right fielder has seemingly positioned himself to rise to the elite class of outfielders.
"You've got three outfielders here, if they put up the years they are capable of, you could possibly have three 30-30 guys in your outfield," Braves first-base coach and former National League MVP Terry Pendleton said. "That would be the first time ever. They've got that type of talent. Just thinking about that is crazy."
There is no precedent that each will hit at least 30 homers and steal 30 bases next year. Only twice have two players from the same team recorded a 30-30 season in the same year -- Dante Bichette and Ellis Burks (1996 Rockies) and Howard Johnson and Darryl Strawberry (1987 Mets).
There have been just four 30-30 seasons in Braves history, and Gant (1990 and '91) is responsible for two. Dale Murphy (1983) and Hank Aaron (1963) notched the others.
"They all three can beat you in a lot of ways," Walker said. "They all three hit with power. All three can run. It's not just with stealing bases. They can also score from first on a double. But at this point, just like everybody else, I'm just sitting back and watching and getting to know them."
Along with their potential offense, the trio has the kind of range that will make opposing pitchers envious of Atlanta's pitching staff.
"Communication is going to be key," Justin Upton said. "Everybody out there can move pretty well and cover some ground. It's going to be interesting. We're going to have to position ourselves well and communicate when we go get the ball. I think it's special to have that kind of athleticism in the outfield. It's more of a luxury than a problem."
From an offensive standpoint, this appears to be the most powerful outfield trio the Braves have possessed since Gary Sheffield, Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones combined for 102 home runs in 2003. But they combined for just 24 stolen bases, with Sheffield accounting for 18 of those.
"Some of those old Braves teams had some unbelievable power in the outfield," Braves Chairman and CEO Terry McGuirk said. "But to have three guys with five tools who have the upside ability with many of those five tools, it's pretty impressive. Age and talent, you put it all together, this machine is really primed to be here for a while."

“Oh no,” she said flatly, when asked if she would buy any lots in the cemetery. “I don’t know, really (in which cemetery she would buy lots). It’s something I’ve got to look into.”
For the second time in about six months, body fluids have leaked from her grandmother’s crypt in the mausoleum.
Attorney Jim Logan said Monday he settled on an oral agreement that deficiencies would be corrected. This time, he will pursue litigation similar to the civil action taken against Fort Hill Cemetery owner Louisville Land Company.
“I’ve contacted Assistant District Attorney Stephen Hatchett and will be giving him the necessary petitions requesting that office to engage in prosecution of the violations,” Logan said. “It took us what, seven years to get (drainage) tiles installed.”
Dale Lawrence of the Lawrence Group of Dallas, Ga., did not respond to requests for an interview left at the cemetery sales office.
Sunset Memorial Gardens, located north of Cleveland on North Lee Highway, was the subject of complaints in 2011. The complaints focused then on heavy equipment used to dig new graves. The equipment leaves ruts in graves and knocks down vases, and outriggers used to stabilize the backhoe crack headstones.
Then, in late July 2012, the crypts leaked body fluids.
“The smell is just horrendous. I think what angers me so much now is we were assured this was resolved six months ago,” Andies said. “They gave their apologies. [They said] the front of her tomb had been removed and sealed correctly; here we are six months later and clearly, it wasn’t done. Clearly, their apologies were insincere.”
Long before a large stain on the carpet can be seen, the smell is overpowering. It is a stench that clings to clothing and penetrates nostrils and sinus cavities. The noxious odor continues to assault the senses long after leaving the cemetery and leaves one feeling nauseous.
“A sickening smell. It’s just horrible,” she said. “It’s a disgrace, not only to the immediate family, but all the family members who are represented here, inside the mausoleum, the grounds throughout the cemetery. This isn’t the first and probably won’t be the last issue we’ve had with them about not keeping the grounds here.”
Ralph Buckner Jr.,. The lights were burned out or broken, a single window air-conditioning unit was broken and the only ventilation came from two box fans. Also, the roof leaked, there was a broken window and the interior was generally dirty.
“Here we are again,” Andies said. “It’s very disheartening. It’s sad so much disrespect is shown to our loved ones,” she said. “When we bury them, we like to think we can visit them and have a sense of peace, and it’s anything but that.”
Logan said about 25 people have contacted his office with various complaints. He said there has been a little work to cover up some of the mold, but the mold is still there.
“We had entered into an oral agreement with the Lawrence Group,” he said. “I tried to get them to enter into a written contract. They have done some of the things they were supposed to do. They did clean what was found about six months ago. It was atrocious. It was very, very, very, very despicable.”
Logan said no ventilation system has been installed, the rear of the building where people park is still unsightly and the crypts were not sealed with plexiglass.
“The violations of those standards applicable to the operation of the mausoleum make it necessary for us to proceed (with litigation). We had high hopes that not only complaints here, but in Hilcrest Cemetery would be resolved long before now,” he said. “There are some things that have been done, but they are minor in terms of the things that need to be done.”.

Tipping Their Hand
As the “Little Injuns that Could” continue to chug their way up the mountain despite the smoking engine and the dings and dents throughout their body, the Indians made a surprising move yesterday when they needed to make room for Jeanmar Gomez’s start against Oakland. While the idea that the Indians would either send Choo off to the DL (he’s out for a while with this side issue) or send the likes of Shelley Duncan or Jerad Head back down I-71 with the idea that either would return in 10 days, after the September 1st roster expansion date and after either had spent enough time in AAA in order to be recalled, the Indians instead sent their Opening Day 1B Matt MaTola off to Columbus.
While the move is entirely justified in terms of LaPorta’s performance, the timing of it is more than a little surprising as the Indians’ current offense resembles that of a AAA team as injuries have laid waste to the Tribe’s position players. At a time when it would seem that the Indians would need any able-bodied position player to be standing at the ready, they sent down LaPorta, who (not all that long ago) was a Top 30 prospect in all of baseball and was (as if you needed to be reminded of this) the BIG bat that came over in the CC deal from the Cream City.
Regardless of that pedigree and his inclusion in the Sabathia deal, there’s little question that LaPorta has “earned” this demotion, as I wrote this three weeks ago, suggesting as much:.
Since that was written, Kipnis, Hafner, and Brantley all hit the DL (and that’s just on the offensive side of things, not to mention Choo, who is out for a couple of weeks with this side injury), with the Indians improbably absorbing these “punches” to stay relevant into September. My suggestion from the piece was to play Santana at 1B every day and for Marson to assume the full-time C duties and that looks to be the direction that the Tribe will take going forward.
If you want to continue with the “since that was written” tract, LaPorta has posted a .603 OPS in the 13 games “since that was written”, striking out 12 times in 41 plate appearance, actually striking out (not just making an out) more often than he got on base since August 10th. Maybe some of this is still injury-related and the argument can be made that he probably should have gone to Columbus on a rehab assignment after the ankle injury (I think I made that argument at one time) as since he has returned from the DL, he’s posted a .231 BA / .256 OBP / .372 SLG / .628 OPS line in 129 PA, striking out 32 times in those 129 PA…or about ¼ of the times he strode to the plate.
If you’ll remember, when LaPorta came off of the DL, the team was short-handed at the time back then and his return allowed some level of normalcy to set in for a team in need of an offensive spark. Certainly, LaPorta didn’t provide that spark (as you look at those numbers above again), and what’s striking about this demotion is that LaPorta heads down to Columbus when the team is even MORE short-handed offensively than they were when he came off of the DL in June, which brings us to this overwhelming feeling about this move, in that it would certainly seem to suggest that the Indians are not counting on Matt MaTola for much of anything, this year or beyond.
Maybe the argument can be made that the Indians are trying to send LaPorta a message, that nobody on the roster (regardless of prospect pedigree or what trade you were involved in) is above being demoted, but in light of their unprecedented need for offense right now and the fact that the Indians are…you know, IN A PENNANT RACE, his demotion speaks volumes about the faith that the have in LaPorta right now and how much (or how little) hope that they might have for LaPorta going forward.
Though LaPorta’s been under the microscope than probably any other current Indian in this space, you want a stunning fact?
Matt LaPorta’s career OPS coming into 2011 was .694 in 623 plate appearances.
In 349 plate appearances in 2011, he has a…yep, .694 OPS.
Lest you forget, MaTola turns 27 in January and now has a fairly consistent track record of posting a sub-.700 OPS (.694, to be exact) over 972 plate appearances in MLB. Those days of thinking that LaPorta was the “answer” at 1B (much less an upgrade over Garko and Broussard) seem like they were long, long ago.
For some perspective on where LaPorta has fallen in terms of standing within the organization, let’s remember again that when the Indians needed to send someone to Columbus for 10 days, they kept Jerad Head and Shelley Duncan on the team over Matt LaPorta. For all intents and purposes, they could have sent Lonnie Chisenhall down for 10 days given the way Hannahan is playing, but instead they dispatched LaPorta. Yes, the Indians need OF and LaPorta hasn’t played LF since he broke his toe in Fenway last year (which may be why he’s not playing LF anymore), but the fact that Head and Duncan – who are both older than LaPorta and are non-prospects (even if Duncan is a useful piece) and have options – start to bring into clearer focus how damning this move is in terms of the long-term future for LaPorta in Cleveland.
Even more than LaPorta going down instead of Head and Duncan is the idea that LaPorta would be sent down in the midst of a pennant race for this team, which has been making moves to maximize this roster for 2011 since they called up Alex White months ago. Seriously, if you think about the moves that the Tribe has made to make a push for 2011 (White’s call-up, Chiz and Kipnis call-up, Kosuke, the Ubaldo deal, Thome) all season long, you start to really get the idea of how much they consider LaPorta to be “helpful” to this team at this point. That said, nearly all of the moves that they’ve made all season have been just as much about the future as the present as they’ve started the adjustment period for guys like Kipnis and Chisenhall and added a top-of-the-rotation starter that helps today and tomorrow.
That brings us back to the idea of the “tomorrow” of Matt LaPorta as, to say this move brings more cloudiness to the horizon of his career as an Indian would be an understatement. His plate discipline is bad and getting worse and his reputation as a “mistake-pitch” hitter (and almost that exclusively) was being cemented as his offensive production looked to be more in line with a Futility Infielder than that of a Future Cornerstone. Though it is true that there is the possibility that injuries played a role and LaPorta just needs to get healthy, e hasn’t been able to stay healthy since he arrived to the organization, so why is there a belief that he’ll suddenly find a full season of health and productivity in 2012?
The short answer is that there isn’t any reason to think that, and I can’t think that LaPorta is being counted on to be the de facto 1B next year for the Tribe at this point, regardless of what trade he was involved in or how high hopes may have been for him at one time. At this point, the Indians (quite suddenly, at least publicly) look to be turning away from LaPorta as a viable option at 1B as, if he’s not going to be trusted to help THIS team (beset by injuries), what incarnation of the future Indians is he going to contribute mightily to?
The answer to that came with his demotion and it’s led to the speculating about the future of certain players that we’re used to doing this time of year…we’re just not used to doing it in the middle of a pennant race.
As for that speculation, one thought that immediately comes to mind in terms of exploring external options for 1B next year is that the “Thome money” earned at the gate that has started to come in (and figures to continue) could perhaps give the Indians some financial flexibility to add a 1B in the off-season. Whether or not the Indians will continue to draw at the level that they have recently (hence the “Thome money”), let’s remember what Terry Pluto wrote last weekend when he passed on that, “the Indians projected 1.3 million at the start of this season”. Right now, they’d be on pace to see between 1.7 million and 1.8 million people come through the turnstiles, with that number perhaps even going higher if the Thome Love Fest keeps playing and if the Indians can draw the casual fan down in the month of September in a pennant race…which seems odd to even write.
Let’s say that they draw 1.75 million by the end of the season (and that’s being pretty cautious) and realize that 1.75 million in attendance is about a 35% increase from their expected gate revenue. While I’m not saying that there’s your “found” Prince Fielder money (just forget that), what it might do is first-and-foremost allow the Indians to be pro-active in locking up their own players (that have proven themselves this year), then have additional funds to perhaps attempt to fill an organizational hole…and 1B certainly looks to be a hole.
Does that mean that you should go out and order a custom jersey with a “PUJOLS 5” or a “FIELDER 28” Tribe jersey for next year? Of course not, but remember how the Tribe really has $17.7M actually committed in payroll next year with decisions on Grady’s option (and I think they pick it up and try to get creative to add more years at lower money by picking up the option) and with arbitration coming for Choo, Perez, and Cabrera (again) as well as Masterson’s first year of arbitration eligibility?
Well, there’s a possibility. By locking those two up (and making the cursory call to Scott Boras…just to see what’s what), the Indians can lock down more of their new, burgeoning “core” for the foreseeable future.
However, it’s still worth noting that if they do agree to a long-term deal with Asdrubal or Masterson (or both…or more), the dollar amounts in those contracts generally ramp up as the years pass, meaning that the Indians still could have some financial flexibility for 2012 and 2013 to explore external options for 1B. In terms of those options, it’s a pretty top-heavy list and the 1B FA pickings start to thin out after Pujols and Fielder in terms of “sure things”, although the switch-hitting Lance Berkman is certainly intriguing, as are Mike Cuddyer and Carlos Pena, although those 1B will have no shortage of suitors.
Of course, the Indians have always been reticent to get into bidding wars with teams that have the ability to simply write off their mistake contracts and given that “reticence” in the FA market (although, remember this organization did add Millwood for 2005 for $7M), maybe they could go the trade route to add a 1B, even if it seems as if the Tribe fired off most of their trade ammunition. Perhaps they could move Rafael Perez and Cord Phelps for something moderately useful as for as much talk as there may be about how CHRIS Perez is about to get more expensive in arbitration, RAFAEL is actually further along in his arbitration years and is about to get more expensive…probably more expensive than he is actually worth. With Hagadone knocking on the door as another LH reliever to go with Sipp, Rafael would probably win the “Perez Most Likely to be Traded” contest for the off-season and Phelps certainly looks to be blocked in a couple of different ways in the organization.
Then again, I’m just spitballing here and wouldn’t expect any kind of “1B of the Future” to come from a trade centered around Rafael Perez and Cord Phelps and it’s worth mentioning that this is all worrying about tomorrow - something Tribe fans are used to in September - when today is more pressing and compelling in the form of a pennant race…which is certainly something Cleveland hasn’t become used to in the last decade.
For now, LaPorta is out of the Indians’ imminent plans in a move that could provide some insight as to what they plan on doing in the off-season. But the off-season is still a month (or hopefully more) away and things are getting exciting again on The Reservation, with thoughts that Grady may be returning and with the Indians doing to the Royals and A’s what they should have done to the Mariners. It is worth noting that after the A’s leave town, the Indians have 28 games left. Fourteen of those games come against the White Sox (8) and the Tigers (6), meaning that there could be some serious movement in the AL Central as all of these teams control their own destiny in their hands.
Lest anyone forget, the Tigers arrive on Monday and there’s still baseball left to be played as September is nearly upon us and a pennant race has remained on the North Coast. Regardless of what 1B in 2012 is going to look like, what’s happening in the here-and-now is unquestionably fun and the fun figures to continue with the hope that this is still only the opening act…

Just to save you guys some reading on irrelevant posts, I wondered about the connection of Hafner and LaPorta getting beaned (in the face and head, respectively) to their drop off in production.
Hafner came back strong for a year and a half, while LaPorta put up good numbers in AAA after taking one off his noggin in Beijing.
Apparently, he just can't hit major league pitching. Hopefully, he gets his confidence back in Columbus.
Great insights Paul! Would love to hear more speculation on possible 1st basemen via trade...
The similarities between LaPorta and Andy Marte (check out Marte's numbers in 2009 and 2010) would be hilarious if they were happening to some other team.
We're getting closer to being able to close the books on the big trades of '08 and '09: 1 win (Martinez--especially since his replacement was already in the high minors) and 2 losses (Sabathia and Lee). For an organization that doesn't spend and traditionally hasn't drafted all that well, that percentage isn't nearly good enough.
MaTola just doesn't look like an MLB-caliber hitter at the plate. He may turn out to be one of the countless players over the years who were superb up through AAA ball and couldn't make the jump to the majors.
At the moment when Jeanmar Gomez had his high performance , some bad Online pharmacy reviews destroyed his career!?

Announcement from Monday, 17 December 2012
The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) is pleased to announce the launch of three new knowledgebases for sustainable development policy makers:
Land Policy & Practice()
Forests Policy & Practice()
Chemicals and Wastes Policy & Practice()
These knowledgebases are part of our suite of knowledge management projects tracking international activities addressing sustainable development issues. Each knowledgebase is managed by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) Reporting Services. Funding for Land Policy & Practice, Forests Policy & Practice and Chemicals and Wastes Policy & Practice has been provided by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
Knowledgebase content is researched and written by our team of thematic experts.
Features of each knowledgebase include:
IISD manages and is fully responsible for the content posted on Land Policy & Practice, Forests Policy & Practice, and Chemicals and Wastes Policy & Practice. Information on United Nations activities is provided in cooperation with the UN system agencies, funds and programmes through the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB).
Land Policy & Practice, Forests Policy & Practice, and Chemicals and Wastes Policy & Practice join IISD's other knowledge management tools:
In early 2008, during preparations for the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, IISD Reporting Services launched its first knowledge management site, Climate Change Policy & Practice. This knowledgebase supported efforts by the sustainable development community to track the various activities undertaken by international actors addressing climate change. Our work on our flagship publication, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, positioned us to make this transition into monitoring the implementation of international multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). Our teams, which attend the MEA negotiations, track the decisions that the international community has taken and understand the wide variety of actors involved in each arena. As 2012 comes to a close, we are pleased to bring you the latest additions to our knowledge management work, and to expand our efforts to track implementation of the agreements that we have reported on for the past 20 years.
For further information on our knowledge management activities, please contact Lynn Wagner, Senior Manager, Knowledge Management Projects (lynn@iisd.org). To provide us with information about your land or forests related activities, please contact Lauren Anderson, Content Editor (lauren@iisd.org). To provide us with information about your chemicals and wastes activities, please contact Faye Leone, Content Editor (faye@iisd.org).

Join the call for all college & university presidents to divest from fossil fuels and move to 100% clean energy.
Right now our movement has some serious momentum. Last weekend 50,000 of us converged on the National Mall to demand we move Forward On Climate.
And this weekend, momentum will continue to build at Swarthmore College.
On Friday hundreds of students from 77 campuses are coming together for the first-ever fossil fuel divestment convergence just as Swarthmore’s Board of Managers meets to consider divesting fossil fuels.
While we can’t bring 50,000 of us there, it’s a huge opportunity to bring that beautiful spirit of solidarity we felt last weekend.
Join the call for divestment! Call on Swarthmore and all colleges & universities to divest from fossil fuels and move to 100% clean energy.
It’s in this spirit of solidarity that we relaunched the Campus Climate Challenge. Youth and student leaders across the country are demanding bold action on climate from their campuses — and together we can support one another and take collective action to win our campaigns.

- How to Read a Study Record
This is a multicenter, single arm, 48-week open-label study of FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF [Stribild] in acute HIV infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection Study Consortium. Participants will be enrolled for 96 weeks. Clinical care and study drug (ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF) will be provided for the first 48 weeks. After week 48, clinical care but not study drug will be provided through week 96. A study participant suppressed at week 48 can continue on FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF.
The primary hypothesis is that once daily fixed-dose combination elvitegravir (ELV), cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) will rapidly reduce viral replication to <50 copies RNA/ml in participants with acute HIV infection. The secondary hypotheses to be considered are 1) virologic response rates as measured by plasma HIV RNA levels will be non-inferior or superior to a historical group of participants from the PHI cohort treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, 2) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, plasma HIV RNA will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF, 3) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, immune activation as measured by the proportion CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CD38+ will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF, 4)in a subset of participants samples will be obtained from compartments such as the gastrointestinal tract, and lymphoid tissues to assess changes over time in parameters such as HIV-1 RNA, immunologic responses to HIV, and tissue and anatomic reservoirs. We hypothesize that treatment with the ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will demonstrate improved viral clearance in these compartments as compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. 5) in a subset of participants who remain suppressed on therapy, resting CD4 cells with replication-competent HIV-1 (latent reservoir) will be quantitated and compared to similar measurements in PHI participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. In addition, we will compare these results to those measured in HIV-1 infected participants treated and 6) ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will be well tolerated, and the proportion of participants who require treatment modification will be less than that observed in participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF.
- viral load measurement of <200 copies/mL at week 24 [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]
- virologic efficacy of the fixed dose combination (FDC) ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF given once daily to participants with acute HIV infection as determined by the proportion of treated participants with HIV-1 RNA to <50 copies/mL at week 48 [ Time Frame: 48 weeks ] [ Designated as safety issue: Yes ]
- rate of virologic decline in the first 24 weeks of treatment comparing FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF to FDC EFV/FTC/TDF [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]

Pediatric HIV Disclosure Intervention
- Full Text View

- How to Read a Study Record
With increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved care, increasing numbers of perinatally infected children are surviving into adolescence. While HIV care and treatment programs are expanding, growing challenge faced by health providers and caregivers is diagnosis disclosure to HIV infected children.
The investigators propose a 4 year project to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural intervention that the investigators have designed to support developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV infected children by their caregiver.
The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to increased disclosure rates and will over time improve health and mental health outcomes among caregivers and children in the intervention group compared to those receiving standard care. The findings of the study will inform Ugandan and other countries' national policies on pediatric HIV care and treatment.
- Disclosure to child of child's HIV-positive status [ Time Frame: 24 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]
- HIV related morbidity [ Time Frame: 24 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]For all children and HIV-infected caregivers, information on WHO stage of HIV infection, treatment status, opportunistic infections, CD4 counts will be abstracted from medical records.
- Child antiretroviral medication adherence [ Time Frame: 24 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]
- Cost and Cost-effectiveness [ Time Frame: 24 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]
- Caregiver depression/anxiety [ Time Frame: 24 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]
- Child behavior checklist [ Time Frame: 24 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]captures depression, anxiety and behavior using the child behavior checklist
Detailed Description:
At the end of 2009, there were an estimated 2.1 million children < 15 years living with HIV, with almost 90% residing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In Uganda alone there are an estimated 150,000 HIV-infected children. Although disclosing to a child that he or she is infected with HIV is an important and integral part of providing comprehensive HIV medical care, studies conducted in SSA have indicated that only 2% to 37.8% of HIV-infected children < 15 years know their HIV status. Studies by the investigators' team and others have revealed a high demand by both caregivers and children for health provider-facilitated communication about HIV and disclosure to HIV-infected children. In Uganda despite the rapid expansion of HIV services for children, very few health providers receive formal training in how to support disclosure of an HIV diagnosis to an infected child. Despite the existence of international and national recommendations for disclosure there are no tested models for supporting caregivers and HIV-infected children in SSA through the process of disclosure.
This study proposes to test the effectiveness of an innovative cognitive-behavioural intervention designed to support developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV-infected children by their caregiver. The proposed intervention builds on the investigators' team's prior research is informed by a cognitive behavioral perspective, as well as the Disclosure Processes Model. The investigators will also adapt components of a multi-faceted program for caregivers of HIV-infected children, developed by members of the investigators' team with funding support from the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
Specific aims:
- To determine the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavior intervention for increasing disclosure of children's HIV diagnosis by caregivers to their HIV-infected children age 7-12 years old in Uganda.
- To determine the effect of disclosure on immediate and longer-term caregiver and child mental health, and child behavioral and clinical outcomes, and whether the intervention modifies these effects
- To assess the incremental cost, health impact, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention
Inclusion criteria:
- children of age 7 to 12 years;
- confirmed HIV-infected;
- unaware of their HIV status, according to caregiver report;
- principal caregiver, age 18 years or older, of the eligible study child is able and willing to participate in their regular treatment program (monthly visits) and data collection visits at the study clinic at 6-month intervals for 24 months;
- agreement to participate in 3 group sessions with other caregivers over a 6 week period, and 3 counseling session with the eligible child(ren), scheduled at the same time as usual clinic visits;
- resides within a 30km radius around the study clinic, and not planning on moving during the study period; caregiver and child must both consent / assent for participation.
Exclusion criteria:
- caregivers and children who are unable to consent or assent to participation in the study due to cognitive impairment or illness;
- for children, medical history of serious birth complications, severe malnutrition, bacterial meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral malaria, or other known brain injury or disorder requiring hospitalization or continued evidence of seizure or other neurological disability;
- for caregivers, severe mental illness or developmental disability.

Speaking of Veterans: The Bonus Army March, 1932
Today is officially Veterans Day in the United States, though much commemoration occurred yesterday, November 11th. This holiday coincides with remembrance of the end of the First World War eighty-nine years ago. A recent article in Street Sense about homelessness among veterans today made me think of the Bonus Army March on Washington in 1932. What was it about their experience in the Great War and Great Depression that made so many veterans coalesce into such a powerful movement?
MacArthur put down the protest violently and the veterans never received an early payout of their promised bonuses. Still, did their movement achieve something? Did it prepare officials and public opinion to treat the next generation of veterans more honorably? It would seem so, though I am not sure about the generations that came after the Second World War. Short memories. Today the public receives its most recent vets with open arms, because it remembers how poorly it treated Vietnam vets, but to what extent is this rhetoric being matched by government programs?

5 Former Athletes Who Flamed Out on TV
entertainment world:
The Not-So Magic Hour
The charismatic Lakers’ legend couldn’t make it work as a late-night talk-show host in 1998 — he was canceled after eight weeks. The show was marked by Johnson’s lack of comfort and chemistry with those around him, and it’s widely considered one of the great TV experiments gone bad of recent years. Johnson has been able to stick around largely as a basketball analyst for ESPN where producers let him be himself. Guess the late-night audience just didn’t want as much Magic in their lives.
Here Today, Gone Tomorrow
If his TV career didn’t go down the toilet fast enough during his stint as a correspondent with NBC’s ‘Today,’ Barber only further embarrassed himself when he was caught cheating on his wife with a 23-year-old NBC intern, whom Barber later married. His broadcasting career should have been a natural fit for the running back. But he never quite crossed over into the mainstream non-sports stories he was assigned, and NBC management grew impatient. In May 2010, the network cut him.
Keeping Up With Bruce’s Face
The Olympian for the decathlon has landed in a bizarre second life as an awkward step-father on ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians.’ Jenner has been ridiculed for his looks and his behavior since the show’s inception in 2007, and has appeared on the show’s spinoff series, ‘Khloe & Lamar.’ Jenner fell into the family when he married his wife, Kris, who was previously married to lawyer Robert Kardashian.
You Can’t Be serious MCENROE
McEnroe hosted ‘The Chair’ on ABC in January 2002, but it was his failed CNBC show, ‘McEnroe,’ that got him really riled up. Twice during its six-month lifespan the show received a 0.0 Nielsen rating. Nobody could save the show, as much as they tried. It turned out that people didn’t wish to turn to a former irritable tennis player for financial wisdom. When McEnroe has stayed more within the lines, and has cameoed as himself in several movies, he’s found a more winning recipe.
FOREMAN’s Sitcom Gets Grilled
He’s made a name for himself as both a boxer and a chef so it’s easy to forget Foreman’s conquest into the CBS sitcom family in 1993. His show, ‘George,’ was panned and is considered by many to be one of the worst sitcoms ever to air. That experience making just nine episodes of the flop must have scared Foreman straight as his few movie appearances afterward have cast Foreman as a boxing commentator.

,’ he performed with two back up singers and dancers who flanked him on either side. He was wearing sunglasses and sparkly leather. The singer took the shades off mid-song and tucked them in the inside pocket of his jacket and even zipped it up. Those must be some special specs if he took such care with ‘em. Turns out he busted them out later in the ep, as part of a Will Ferrell skit.
Usher then appeared in said skit with host Ferrell, where they danced and sang in the 2012 Funkytown Debate. He looked faboo in a big, floppy, fur-covered hat.
The singer returned to the stage to rock his first ‘Looking 4 Myself’ single ‘Climax,’ sans the glasses. Usher made effective use of his time on the ‘SNL’ stage, playing both an uptempo song and one that was more laid back and chill. He ditched the black jacket during the performance to show off his toned and tattooed arms in front of blue laser lights. Anyone else notice that two-finger ring he’s sporting? That thing looks dangerous!
In any case, Ush was more emotional during ‘Climax,’ that’s for sure. One might say he was climaxing.

After silent with regard to the duty of staff to use the AED.
Recently, an appellate court in New York addressed the issue of whether the legislation that requires an AED on health club premises also creates a duty for the certified employee to apply the AED on a club member in distress. In Miglino v. Bally Total Fitness, the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division’s interpretation of New York State General Business Law 627-a created a duty to use the AED during an emergency situation despite the New York state legislature’s silence on the issue.
The Miglino case stems from an incident on March 26, 2007, when a member of a Bally Total Fitness club in Long Island, NY, collapsed as he played racquetball at the club. A club member informed the front desk about what happened, and a 911 emergency call was placed. A Bally employee, who was a personal trainer and had completed a certification course in the operation of an AED, responded to the scene along with a doctor who was a member. The club’s AED was brought to the scene but never used. An ambulance arrived about 8 minutes after 911 was called and took the club member to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
The estate of the club member brought an action against Bally seeking monetary damages for failing to use the AED as mandated by New York General Business Law Section 627-a[3] and for failing to use life-saving measures on the club member. Bally moved to dismiss the case arguing that the trained club employee had no duty to use the AED. Bally also argued that liability could not be imposed based upon New York’s Good Samaritan Law (New York Public Health Law Section 3000-a) that insulates a voluntary responder to an emergency situation from liability unless the volunteer acted with gross negligence. New York’s Appellate Court denied the motion to dismiss and held that New York law recognizes a cause of action if Bally can be found to have negligently failed to use its AED on the decedent.
In 2005, New York amended General Business Law Section 627-a requiring every health club in the state with more than 500 members to have an AED on the premises. The law further requires that during staffed business hours, the club must have an employee on the premises who is certified by a nationally recognized organization or association in the use of the device and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
In its decision, the court cited a 2002 article in the medical publication Circulation Journal of the American Heart Association entitled “Automated External Defibrillators in Health/Fitness Facilities” and recognized the importance of an AED being immediately available in an emergency cardiac situation at a health club given that there is a substantial risk of a cardiac arrest after strenuous exercise. In addition, the court cited the legislative history of the statute acknowledging the strong public policy of the enactment of the law to prevent deaths associated with cardiac arrests after exercise.
In support of its motion to dismiss the case, Bally cited New York’s Public Health Law Sections 3000-a and 3000-b. More commonly known as the Good Samaritan Law, this law provides that a person who voluntarily and without expectation of monetary compensation renders emergency treatment to an individual at the scene of an accident or other emergency situation outside of a hospital or other medical setting, shall not be liable for damages for any injuries or death as a result of the emergency treatment rendered unless it is established that the injuries or death were due to “gross negligence” on the part of the volunteer. This standard is much higher than needs to be established in comparison to the ordinary negligence standard otherwise imposed on a health care provider on treatment rendered in a non-emergent situation. The public policy underlying Good Samaritan Laws is clear in that the state, while certainly not mandating it, wants to encourage its citizens to assist each other in emergency situations when no licensed or certified emergency responder is available.
The New York Appellate Court held that the Good Samaritan Law did not prevent the club member’s estate from bringing an action against Bally for the failure to use the AED. While acknowledging that New York’s law mandating an AED at health clubs with greater than 500 members did not contain any specific provision imposing an affirmative duty to use the AED, the court held that it would be “illogical to conclude that no such duty exists.” The court went on to say that if it did not interpret the statute to impose a duty to use the AED, it would “eviscerate the very purpose for which the legislation was enacted… and would [render] the provision meaningless…” The court supported its rationale by questioning why the state would mandate a health club to provide the AED and a certified user if no simultaneous duty existed to use it.
While many states have taken steps to expand public access to AEDs, only 10 states have created legislation regarding the availability of AEDs in exercise facilities: Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island. In addition, the laws have similarly created a duty of the owners and operators of the facilities to have on the premises an employee who is trained in the use of the AED. As in New York, the users of the mandated AEDs in the other states are protected from liability with regard to the use of the AED through similar Good Samaritan Laws.
Most of the states noted above fail to make reference to the duty of the health clubs or their certified employees to use the AED in an emergency situation. In fact, with the exception of Michigan, the various statutes do not use the term “duty.” Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island all require that an AED be available on the premises and require that an employee be medically trained to use the device during business hours. Louisiana requires only that the AED is available on the premises. None of the states mentions a need to actually use the device. However, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island do offer protection from liability for the use or non-use of the device. It is apparent that if an affirmative duty is to be found, it will be in the hands of the courts to make that determination.
The current regulations likely will stir up debate about whether a duty to use the AED will attach along with the duty to provide the device and a certified trained employee.
Despite the protection from liability afforded to health club owners and their employees with regard to the use of AEDs, some courts will recognize a cause of action against health clubs if the club’s certified employee fails to use the device in emergency situations. This seems to contradict the legal protections afforded to voluntary responders under the various Good Samaritan Laws. It is up to health club owners and their employees to become aware of the additional responsibility to affirmatively act, apply the AED and determine if the AED is medically indicated under the circumstances. With the expanded availability of AEDs to the general public, the courts and the states likely will evaluate if a duty to apply the device attaches regardless of the location or the circumstances.

FOTD Friday: L’Oreal HIP’s Sculpted eyeshadow duo
>>IMAGE<<
Category: FOTD Friday
beautiful as always. u have a good weekend too!
I love this duo! Look very pretty on you!
Yes, I have that duo and love it.
Beautiful application. Love the blush on you. What blush is it?
love the duo
the makeup is gorgeous
I went crazy on a HiP BOGO sale at walgreens a few months ago and I have almost every color – except for some of the newer ones. This is one of my fav. next to wicked
I have this one and it's one of my faves. It makes a great smoky eye. I haven't tried it for daywear though. Check out mspurplekisses81 on youtube for tuts on hip duos. That girl is BAD! She should be a rep for L'Oreal because she works these duos like nobodies business. She can make the brightest duos wearable for everyday. She has a tut for almost all of them, and if she doesn't have one you want to see send her a request and she'll hook you up. I'm telling ya'll, she's the best. My YT name is staceface75 so if you stop by her channel let her know that I sent you her way with rave reviews!
That's a lovely duo. You look gorgeous!
I love the way the HIP duos look on you, but I just haven't got the hang of applying them.
And there's no such thing as blush overload. The more, the better.
a girl after my own heart! i agree, less is def more with shadows like that. i usually pack at least one hip duo with me when i go out of town. gotta luv it!
Another cute look B.
Good job and have a great weekend.\
PJD
The blush is pretty!
i love L'OREL's HIP cosmetic line! They put some bold colors together, BUT when put on they are Fantabulouse and they arent expensive at all!
"Windshield wiper motion"? You crack me up! BTW, I wanted to let you know that I gave you a Kreativ Blogger Award
Keep doing your thing!
C
I love "sculpted" on you! Funny thing, I wore it to work today. Your application is nice…Thanks for the post
This one is the best thus far…I'm loving the colors!!
I SO want that duo… so bad HIP is not sold here… but it´s a very pretty combination
I have this duo and Sassy(a teal and taupe one) and never wear them because I couldn't just "throw" them on and go…After seeing you work your magic with this duo…I think I was just applying the shades a little too heavy handed…I'll have to give them another try.
I love the way you toned down the metallics for the eye look. Nice!
The black with the purple glitter in this duo is a really good dupe for those of you who didn't get a chance to pick up MAC's young punk e/s from the style black collection. And the one thing that this black has over young punk is that you don't have all the fallout from the glitter in young punk.
Thank you, my darlings!
Hey Brittles, I love this look on you. I do have it and I love it. Def easy to apply.
How cute are you?! Love those glasses!
Thank you, chicas!
Loving IT!!!! xxx, GC
cute! looks like we all have sculpted on the brain. i just did a post about it too
I absolutely LOVE that blush…Beautiful!

The Global Search for Education
“There is no competitive advantage today to knowing more than the person sitting next to you.” — Tony Wagner
Is Your Child an Innovator
By C. M. Rubin with Harry Rubin and Michael Freeborn
“The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.” — President Barack Obama, January 25, 2011
Welcome..
“The competitive advantage for someone going out into the world is what they can do with what they know.” — Tony Wagner.
“What students need is practice in applying their learning to new situations, not just in the classroom, but in the community.” — Tony Wag.
For my new book I interviewed Joel Podolny, Vice President of Human Resources at Apple, who has taught at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, and he told me that to get into these kinds of schools you learn to play a game. A game of getting perfect scores, building a resume, etc. The problem is, if you have not learned how to collaborate, to take risks and learn from your mistakes, to create as opposed to consume — all the qualities that matter in the world of innovation — then companies like Apple will have no use for you.
“Instead of preaching that all students should be ‘college-ready,’ we should instead establish the goal of all students being ‘innovation-ready’.” — Tony Wagner
To what extent is innovation capability a function of family and external influences?
These days, young people become innovators in spite of their schooling, rather than because of it. In my research, I found both parenting and teaching practices that strengthen the capacity to innovate — emphasizing discovery-based play, limiting screen time, encouraging young people to find and pursue their passion, take risks and learn from mistakes, and instilling a sense of the importance of “giving back” — these were all things that parents and teachers of young innovators encouraged.
What overall rating do you give the US Public School system for training innovators
A grade of F. But it is not the teacher’s fault. They are not encouraged to innovate, and there is no funding for educational R&D. We must prepare teachers differently and develop lab schools for 21st century learning and teaching. Mostly importantly, we need to begin using much better assessments, like the College and Work Readiness Assessment and the Collegiate Learning Assessment. Assessment drives instruction, and having the wrong metric is worse than having none at all. Multiple choice, computer-scored test results tell us nothing about the quality of teaching or students’ college, career, and citizenship readiness. Every student should have a digital portfolio as a cumulative record of the development of his or her innovation skills. Finally, instead of preaching that all students should be “college-ready,” we should instead establish the goal of all students being “innovation-ready.” Young people don’t necessarily have to go to college to learn to innovate. Nearly half of Finland’s high school students choose a career and technical education track, rather than an academic track, and Finland has a higher innovation standing than the US.

U.S. finalizes loan aid for two solar plants
The U.S. Energy Department finalized loan guarantees for two major solar projects today, as the deadline loomed for the government's renewable-energy incentive program.
The government wrapped up deals that would back $737 million in financing for a solar thermal plant sponsored by privately held SolarReserve and $337 million in financing for a Sempra Energy photovoltaic solar project.
With funding for the government's loan program set to expire at the end of the week, investors have been watching to see what deals will be completed before time runs out.
The loan program has faced intense scrutiny after the high-profile collapse of Solyndra, a solar-panel maker that was the first company to receive funding under the program.
Republican lawmakers investigating the Solyndra loan guarantee have raised concerns that the Obama administration may rush to complete loans to meet the program's deadline.
SolarReserve Chief Executive Kevin Smith, however, said the government had conducted an extensive review of its application. … Read more

Coaching is bigger than a game
Fan voting will decide the top 15 coaches from each division who will qualify for our objective scoring model endorsed by the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame. The model will produce ten finalists from Division I-FBS and five finalist coaches from each of the three other divisions, based on the criteria below.
Sportsmanship
The best coaches conduct themselves in an honorable way on and off the field. By treating their players, opposing coaches and the media with respect, they set an example for everyone to follow.
Integrity
Integrity means knowing how to win the right way. The best coaches refuse to bend or break the rules to keep their teams on top and require the same from their players.
Responsibility
Coaches aren’t just leaders of their team, but also leaders in their community. They give back to their schools and communities that cheer on their teams every week.
Excellence
Wins and losses aren’t the only measure of excellence. It’s also about encouraging student-athletes to excel in the classroom so they be successful in anything they pursue when their playing days are done.
On the Field — Wins, penalties, and year-over-year improvements are among the measures of on-field excellence by the coach, his staff, and his team.
Off the Field — The coach’s commitment to education is measured by academic progress rate (APR) scores for the Division I schools and success at producing Academic All-Americans for Divisions II and III.

Gin: A Global History by Lesley Jacobs Solmonson
Freelance writer and co-founder of 12BottleBar.com, Lesley Jacobs Solmonson, takes on the topic of gin in The Edible Series, and this is no easy task. Possibly the most difficult distilled spirit to explain in terms of its history, gin is both beloved and notorious, and its stories are filled with buts, and thens, and colorful connotations that would have most writers baffled. Jacobs Solmonson does a wonderful job of helping us figure it all out.
I have read large volumes on the history of gin and with every one I have had to continually reference backward to follow the spirit's timeline. It is, I think, the most confusing history of a liquor and that is why I have such a great appreciation for this far more concise telling of events. She takes the reader on a trip with gin, from the Dutch jenever to the British takeover, the development of our beloved London dry to the experimental world of New American Gin. The tonic turned sophisticated tipple is worthy of note and appreciation, as are these tales written so clearly.

Rum: A Global History by Richard Foss
Food historian and journalist, Richard Foss, explores the often underrated, yet highly influential, history of rum in this small book. As he acknowledges in the introduction, rum has influenced culture, commerce, and society in a variety of ways over the years, making it, historically speaking, one of the most important distilled spirits.
Another finely written volume, Foss has delved into rum's storied past and attempts to look into the spirit's future in an entertaining read. Not as in depth as some other rum compendiums such as Wayne Curtis' And A Bottle of Rum, and yet not a historical snapshot either, this volume encompasses the major events of the liquor that has for years been taken, adapted, and produced throughout the world. From the Caribbean to the British Navy, colonial New England to today's ever expansive market, Foss details this story in a bright, respectful way that will have anyone sipping the sweet syrup before reaching the second chapter.

Vodka: A Global History by Patricia Herlihy
Vodka is not as simple as it is often described. No, the clear, tasteless, odorless grain spirit is far, far more complicated than that and in this volume of The Edible Series, Emmanuel College Professor, Patricia Herlihy, attempts to dispel the myths and explain the global phenomenon that is the vodka market. She has done an amazing job at covering the entire scope of what vodka was and is. I cannot place one aspect of vodka that has passed her attention in such a surprisingly short book.
Beyond the history and production of vodka, Herlihy gives due attention to the craziness of the business of making vodka and this is my favorite aspect of the book. She examines the many variations of vodka, from the various grains and other base distillates such as potato to the astounding variety of flavor infusions which never cease to amaze me in their choices. She also looks at the marketing side of vodka from its origins to today. Unlike many distilled spirits, this is a liquor that is all about sales, more sales, and finding the most innovative way to appeal to a certain subset consumers. Herlihy also takes a look at our personal preferences when it comes to vodka. How "our brand" defines us, how it is so easily abused, and why it finds its way into so many drinks. Neither overly technical nor cultural, this is one of the most interesting books on vodka I've seen yet, possibly because Herlihy makes it feel so much more personal, having no qualms about telling the story of vodka how it really is.

Whiskey: A Global History by Kevin R. Kosar
As Kevin R. Kosar, founder of AlcoholReviews.com, explains in the introduction, this is not a glorification of whiskey like so many other books on the subject. It is, instead, a look at the spirit from all sides: the good, the bad, all encompassing. In the book, Kosar examines the origins of whiskey, how it is made, its lineage, its harsh business, and its evolution into a modern marketing machine.
It is quite the fascinating read and Kosar's style of writing makes it one of those enjoyable historical accounts. He looks at whiskey as a whole and breaks it down into the various styles, including the distinctions within those often national styles: how one Scotch can have an entirely different profile from one produced down the road yet retain its signature Scotch-iness. He also takes a look at the downfalls of whiskey such as its toxic effects on society over the years, its mass marketing machine complete with celebrity endorsements and cure-all tonic adverts. Recipes and brands have come and gone (and sometimes returned); whiskey has evolved over the years while simultaneously remaining distinctly whiskey, and Kosar does a wonderful job of distilling all of this down into a handy little book.

Yea, you're right, Anonymous 8:21, but a better DVD label would not have put the amount of care and restoration, the gathering of all the bonus materials and the two audio commentaries included within.
Yes, a better DVD label would have just put it out as a bare bones disc with probably just the trailer as the only piece of bonus material.
Yes, a better DVD label could have put this out, Anon 8:21, but the superior DVD label called CODE RED is releasing Stunt Rock.

Carmen is one of my favorites and it is being performed, for FREE, in Tel Aviv, this summer!!
I am going!!
It is going to be hot, humid, and crowded as hell, but I am going!
It is going to be after a LONG chemo day (I will be getting both Doxil and Herceptin that day), but I am going!
It is going to wipe me out, but I am going!
As soon as I am done with chemo, I will gather my kids and take the train to Park HaYarkon. We will bring a picnic and and camp out until they let us in.
We will be hot. We will be sweaty. But we will be there!
You are welcome to join us!
Need I remind you? Admission is FREE!
When is this happening? Thursday, July 29th.
What time is the performance? 9:00 pm (that's 21:00, for you Israelis)
Officially, audience entrance begins at 7:00 pm, but maybe they'll let us in earlier....
How long is the performance? Approximately one hour and 45 minutes.
Where exactly is the performance? Ganei Yehoshua (Park Hayarkon) in Tel Aviv.
Park HaYarkon is MILES long. I have no idea where Ganei Yehoshua is. I imagine we will figure this out when we get off the train. Apparently, the train does stop right next to Park HaYarkon. I have no idea how close the train stop is to where we want to be.
Maybe you are wondering who is sponsoring this Opera in the Park?
The Municipality of Tel Aviv Yafo and the Israeli Opera continue the annual summer open air opera in the park tradition in Ganei Yehoshua. This summer's presentation is one of the most popular operas in the repertoire: Carmen, by Bizet, in a colorful and extravagant production.
Carmen, a free spirited gypsy, runs aways from prison, falls in love with the Toreador, and gets killed by her former lover.
This larger than life, open air production is based on Franco Zaffirelli's production at the Metropolitan Opera, New - York.Email me if:
1. you are interested in joining us
2. you have a chair I can sit on for the performance
3. you know if my disability card can get us in earlier
4. you know of a good place to hang out while we wait to get in
5. you can explain how to get to Ganei Yehoshua from the train stop at Park HaYarkon
6. you have any other great ideas
Do not email me to tell me that I am crazy. I already know that.
(For more information about Carmen in the Park, see below)
Please daven (or send happy, healing thoughts) for RivkA bat Teirtzel.

sounds awesome. I won't be in the country then though.
i went two years ago- it was a blast.
it is in ganei yehoshua. i can give you exact directions closer to the date.
you need to get there early if you want to sit close up - but i preferred being on top of the hill with ample view of the huge 2 screens on either side of the stage.
Enjoy! Can you ask your oncologist to have your infusion a day later so you won't be as tired from the chemo when you go to the opera? I know in the States I can make changes to my schedule within reason.
Jill
I'm not into opera, however did you see the youtube mob-flash TA opera at dizengoff center? awesome!
I am happy that you will be there! Hope you enjoy the show. :) Refuaa Shlema! Rinat Shaham (Carmen)
My father was very into opera and made us listen to Carmen all the time - among other things. Enjoy!
So happy for you, I know you will enjoy it.....hopfully you will be able to exchange chemo days so that you might not be so tired and you will be able to enjoy Carmen so much more.....:-) Hugs
I went there the last two years--so fun!!!
Unfortunately, I won't go this year because of my year of mourning. But you will have a blast.
G-d willing, I'll see you there next year!!!
Wow! I'd love to go. It's right after I get back from taking my father to AZ. Remind me that tuesday if you remember, please.
I just caught up on the last month and a half or so.
First - enjoy the opera. Sounds great!
disease progression - feh but, as you wrote, no surprise. I'm glad there are still drug options and I hope they're not too tough and that they keep this at bay.
your daughter's bat mitzvah and how amazing she was - Mazal TOV!!
the dress - troggezunt and enjoy!
I'm sure, like always, that I'm forgetting other things. Take care.
Leah G -- Have a great vacation! I'll see you when you get back!!
IsraLuv -- I thought I wanted to sit up close, but another friend also mentioned how much she enjoyed sitting on top of the hill. I have decided that I don't really care where I sit as long as I can sit in a CHAIR!
Jill -- Besides the time factor, and being tired after spending the day in the hospital, I'm not really worried about being treated on the same day as the opera. In Israel, the oncology day ward is closed on Fridays, so I do not really want to postpone treatment, 'cause that would mean postponing it by at least three days. Since this will only be my second dose of both Doxil and Herceptin, I do not want to delay treatment.
Mikimi -- I love opera and loved that video clip. I actually posted it on my blog, but now I see that the post is not up. I'll have to fix that...
Rinat -- thank you so much for visiting my blog!! how did you find it?? I look forward to hearing you sing Carmen in Tel Aviv!!
Jennifer in MamaLand -- my mother is the one who was into opera. I will forever be grateful to her for passing on that appreciation to me! My dad likes opera too, but, when he goes, he always falls asleep in the middle! Interestingly, my in-laws are also into opera, but my husband is not.
Bernie -- as long as I am not in pain, I will love Carmen, no matter how tired I am!!
Baila -- it's a date!
Batya -- I cannot be counted on to remind you. I suggest you write it in your calendar. That's what I do! Why are you taking your dad to AZ? Btw, my parents and brother live in Phoenix.
Miriam -- thanks!! your comments always make me smile!!
Sounds like a wonderful evening - maybe I'll see you there. Sitting on hill sounds much more comfortable than in the middle of the crowd, especially in muggy Tel Aviv.
As for being crazy, it's in a wonderful way that makes life more fun and colorful ;-)
1. you are interested in joining us
I am, but Rabbi Devra might veto it. the three weeks, I mean the fifty two weeks
2. you have a chair I can sit on for the performance
we have one, a folding one like this but I would gladly shlep something more comfortable for you even like this
3. you know if my disability card can get us in earlier
clueless, but will gladly call the suitable pakid to get the right answer
4. you know of a good place to hang out while we wait to get in
Umm, wouldn't you need to stay on line to keep your spot? Otherwise it is across from Ganei Hataarucha, there may be a free air conditioned taarucha going on there at the time, I can look into that too
5. you can explain how to get to Ganei Yehoshua from the train stop at Park HaYarkon
Working on it, loםks like a 5 minute walk, would you believe 10. depending exactly where the sitting spot is, between 300 and 800 meters from the train station

Guys, Thanks !I've been a lifetime FP user, and I eventually got a bit tired of the "chewy-ness" of my coffees. I wanted fresh, clean and flavorful. After reading this extensive 89 page discussion of the Brazen, This had to be the machine.All I can say is WOW.I got it yesterday from Roastmasters with a lb of Willoughby's House Blend. I used 1/2 cup (~40g) grind from an Capresso Infinity at a notch below mid Med for a 0.9L pot. I was surprised that this is exactly what I would use for the FP, except the water temp would be in the 190 range.Brew conditions : 1:30 Pre-soak @ 200 FTotal brew time for start ~10 min. Seriously, this is the best cup of coffee I've ever had. With a bit of creamer : Chocolate, caramel, great body and no bitterness. Best of all, no grounds in my cup.From set-up to brew, everything about this maker is easy. And I love the varibility of the Pre-soak to brew temp. You're guaranteed a perfect cup every time.I would never start my day at 5:30am to join a forum and post an opinion; just wanted to say Thanks.And perfect timing........ The kids have the day off of school, I'll have the Brazen running all day !Cheers - Mark

Mark: I'm sure that many who follow this topic, and contemplate purchasing the Brazen (as I do) would be interested in your observations with regard to the every day usability of this coffee maker, i.e. ease of pouring coffee from the carafe, condensation on and around the basket, the top of the Brazen, water left in the brew chamber, etc.I'm convinced that you can get a really good cup of coffee from this device, but I am apprehensive about the many negatives cited by those posting to this forum! Perhaps it would be wiser to wait for version 2.0??Many thanks!LIY
LIY, Great points. As others have pointed out, pouring from the carafe works best when the spout is almost directly vertical to the cup. I have no reasonable explanation for why having the carafe pouring in slightly tilted to the cup results in a little flow down the carafe....IMO, it's a non- issue. I place the spout vertical to the cup, then trigger the opening and I don't get any spillage. Any amount that would spill over, however, is minimal. Very little condensation is left in the brewing basket. When the brew is finished and I'm ready to clean out the basket, I rinse the basket and let it dry out in the sink. Another non-issue for me. I use a Capresso Infinity grinder set at mid-medium with the gold filter supplied with the brewer. The filter is fine so I could see how having a grind greater than med could cause poor drainage. There's not much room between the brew basket and the gold filter so I don't think there could be much water left over from there.Naturally, there's going to be some residual water left over in the brew basket as the coffee grounds cool and continue to drain, It's minimal. There's moisture left over in the water reservoir, which doesn't bother me since I just add to the reservoir marking lines. I've only made 6 cup - 0.9L brews, and the coffee brewed seem to be the appropriate amount, although I don't care to measure it accurately..... I'd rather drink it. It ended up between 800 and 900 ml in a non- scientifically graded bottle. Finally, I cleaned the brewer with a damp soapy cloth then followed with the calibration and 2 clean water passages. I don't taste or smell anything off, musty, medicinal, or plastic. So far, I've brewed 2 batches - Willoughby's House (2 day old) and Starbucks French (2 months old) both 40g at the same grind 1:30 Pre-soak and at 200F. Both amazing. Wife loves it too, which is most important ! And she's a real critic. Starbucks tasted better and fresher than from the store. I did't think this brew maker had a lot of negative comments. I bought it based on the comments on this forum.IMO.... On a forum like this with the owner of the company being a member, I expected negative comments or - critiques. The members of this forum took interest in this brew maker because it's unique. They are interested in helping the manufacture in making a better product. Yet, One comment did stand out - there's a lot of Brazens that have been sold, and the company is reporting less than 3% as having issues. Not everyone is going to provide positive feedback. If a product works as expected, why would you, unless your blown away with the results. But - negative issues are another matter. Members of this forum were just reporting their feedback.And although the brew maker is new to the market, I don't see how a version 2.0 could be better. For over ten years my FP poured funny and leaked with every brew, produced unpredictable tasting coffee and left me with a mouth full of grind. The Brazen is a pleasant step-up. But does the Brazen brew better than a cheaper maker ?, I couldn't tell you that..... It does make Starbucks French better than the local Starbucks store ! And is worlds better than the FP.I'm new to this machine, time will tell. It works perfectly out of the box and I love it. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask !- Mark

Juan Wauters: "Sanity"
Single (2013)
By Maura McAndrew | 4 March 2013
It’s been a while since I’ve had a chance to rave about Queens, NY trashcan pop band the Beets. After releasing two delightfully ramshackle, catchy records in 2011 (most notably the excellent Let the Poison Out), the Beets experienced a quiet 2012 playing sporadic local live shows—normal, perhaps, for other bands who don’t work at these guys’ typical breakneck pace. And though the lack of attention paid to this band by, well, anyone is vexing, I feel confident that someday the Beets will be appreciated. But right now they’re still a scrappy group of oddballs playing around in an un-hip borough, for which I salute them.
All this glorification is not in service of new Beets material per se, but close: frontman Juan Wauters, he of the Uruguayan accented voice that sounds like Jad Fair finally learned how to sing, has released a solo 7” entitled “Sanity.” Wauters’s fondness for simple early Beatles-style melodies is more apparent than ever here, from the strumming intro to the singalong chorus. Over three Beets records, Wauters has subtly strengthened his songwriting, reigning in a tendency to throw anything and everything at the wall, and that growth continues with “Sanity,” a short, concise burst of pop magic. The effortless feeling remains, but is accompanied by a sense of sharpness, from the traditional mid-song guitar solo to the perkily staccato chorus, “In my head / Don’t know whether there / Is sanity or not.”
Like Wauters’s work with the Beets, “Sanity” is not a song that begs for analysis. It’s rather the type of song with a knack for vanquishing motive or critical thought, and tricks one into simply listening, and pressing play again.

At some point between the hours of about 1 a.m. and 8 a.m., my blog reached 1,000,000 page views. By the time I went to bed, it was only about 50 hits away. I was sorely tempted to log out and visit my blog a few dozen times to push things along so I could witness the roll-over before going to sleep, but that just didn’t seem right. While there might have been a time in my life when I would have stayed up to watch it happen organically, this is not that time of my life. I went to bed. I awoke to the sound of the thumping of small children running around the house around quarter to 8. I reached for my iPad, and saw that the count was above a million. The roll-over was over. So I rolled over myself, and went back to sleep for a bit more. So much for fanfare. (Before 8 in the morning, I will invariably choose sleep over fanfare.)
I don’t remember the exact count at 7:45 this morning, but I think it was something around 1,000,016. So the roll-over probably happened around 6:30 or 7 in the morning, on Sunday, September 16th. So, Maria, your guess of the dieciseis was closest! (A few hours early, but it was around 16:00 somewhere in the world.) So, what fine prize will you choose?

Wow!
Thanks, Mom!
holy cow. i can only dream about those kinds of numbers. congrats!
Sarah, it’s not as exciting as it sounds. I wish I could dream of your number of appreciative readers! (And if only I were as good a writer as you!) I think a good 80% of my hits are people looking for something, usually a picture, and moving on. Most of what I post is seen or read by only a precious few. (And by “few,” I’m guessing I have around 100 people who visit my blog, either regularly or periodically. And by “precious,” I mean that I really appreciate those who actually do come back far more than the faceless thousands who come across my blog but don’t find it worth a return visit.)
oh, but don’t sell it short. i think it’s terrific! your photos are phenomenal.
Congratulations! :) I noticed it was getting close yesterday, rather earlier in the day.
Thanks, Sally! And thanks for all your encouragement along the way.
Well deserved. And a real landmark.
Thanks, Mary! I’m not sure how well it’s deserved, but it does feel like some sort of achievement.
Well, holy crap on a cracker! This is the most exciting thing that I’ve read all morning. Congrats.
Thanks, Ally Bean! And thanks for making me giggle with your colorful metaphorical language! I may well have to use that one. (If I may borrow it from you.)
Feel free to say it whenever it seems appropriate. I’ve found it to be a most useful turn of phrase when I don’t really quite know what to say! Fits many circumstances and seems to convey just the right amount of emotion.
Wooohooooooooo! Yay and yay! Or rather AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYYYYYYYY!
Also, this:
Congratulations, Maria! And can I just say that this is the first time I have, to my knowledge, found mariachi music in my comments? So, woohoo!
But.. Who was the millionth hit??
Sadly, I have no idea, and as far as I know, no way of ever finding out. I can only assume it was some dude in Saudi Arabia looking for a picture of a pink egg or some woman in Nepal looking to learn about Puerto Rican fruit. Or maybe just some insomniac from Nebraska looking to find an “etymological spider drawing.” (I’m not even sure what that would look like, but I don’t think they had any luck finding one here.)
Fabulous. You deserve a million more!
Thanks! Maybe in another 6-ish years I’ll get there!

Big Picture
One of the best things about Maryland are the living and learning programs. They make a University of over 30,000 undergrads seem like a small community. It makes it easier not to get lost in the shuffle. I would change the structure of the Student Government Association and how they allocate funds. The size of the school can be overwhelming at times but its great going to such a big university because there is always something to do, a new activity to get involved with, or meeting new people. College Park, despite the name is NOT a college town. There are about 5 bars on Rte. 1 and thats it. There also is some animosity between the university and the city of College Park. Crime is an issue here. The Administration (especially the Diversity Provost) is awesome. He's very accessible, easy to talk to and always willing to help with student initiatives. Biggest controversy--a noose was hung outside of the black student union in Fall 07 MD students have a ton of school spirit, which is one of my favorite things about Maryland. We're "terpaholics"
Academic Life
As an African American studies major I know my professors really well. I have a key to their office! But with the larger majors its much more difficult to make that kind of connection so students really need to make an effort to get noticed by their professors. Within my major (African American Studies) class participation is a fundamental component of the class Serious academic conversations happen all the time, especially within the activist community, world issues and other topics are frequent points of conversation. The African American Studies dept is really small and personal. I know all the staff and my advisor knows me really well. I have a really good relationship with the professors and I often talk to them about non class related things. I do think that the dept. is way under funded especially considering the caliber of the faculty within the dept. But Behavioral and Social Sciences in general is extremely under funded. Education here can be geared to learning to learn or to get a job it depends on the dept. and it depends on how the student takes the information given to them. The business school, criminal justice and the government and politics dept. definitely promotes just getting a job or going to law school. Only international development and conflict management seem to be interested in learning to learn. Smaller majors like American Studies, Sociology, Anthropology have students interested in learning for learnings sake.
Student Body
There is a place for everyone at Maryland. With such a large campus, it's easy to find people that you relate to. Class is really casual but it depends on the person, it ranges from pajamas to really stylish and well dressed, but no one cares what you're wearing either way. Some students are extremely politically aware but a great deal of students are really apathetic, which is unfortunate being so close to DC. I would say that most students are center/left,
The Best Things
opportunity to experience something new and different everyday because of our proximity to DC and the size of campus there is always something going on
The Worst Things
red tape and bureaucracy

Daniel Clowes is no stranger to the movies, with his GNs GHOST WORLD and ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL having been produced, and several screenplays under his belt. Now, it looks like his recent hit WILSON may be headed to the screen. Alexander Payne is set to direct with Josh Donen producing for Sam Raimi’s Stars Road shingle.
Payne, not much heard from since the multi-Oscar nominee SIDEWAYS, has a new movie coming out, THE DESCENDANTS, described as “A land baron tries to re-connect with his two daughters after his wife suffers a boating accident.” YOU may recall his other fine, fine films: ABOUT SCHMIDT, about a lonely older man who tries to connect with his daughter; and SIDEWAYS, about a lonely middle-aged man who tries to connect with someone.
WILSON, you might recall, is about an awkward, isolated middle-aged man who is desperate to connect with someone, anyone.
Perhaps Payne is just the perfect director for this sort of material.
And his movie, Election, about a lonely teacher trying not to connect with an ambitious high school student.
Payne’s movies usually have a dark comedy about them. I hope he films it in Omaha!
It should be interesting how they film this.
The art style varies in each of the strips. Plus the pacing itself is done in a interesting method of short one page strip vignettes. I found if fascinating how Clowes dropped a few twists by not showing you the story in-between those. There’s some stuff hidden in between the gutters and pages that surprise the reader. You really don’t get the full scope of what a creepy main character he is until reveals later on.
Also, I gotta brag that I got Clowes to sign my copy at an event in Harvard Square right after it came out. He’s a very nice guy and down to earth. Very odd to think of him involved with Hollywood films. Though certainly Wilson would make for one hell of an interesting one and this would surely (thankfully) be a smaller film. The book is already amazing on its own, of course, but it would certainly be a film that I hope would make an interestingly shaped dent in cinema.

WASHINGTON, August, 22, 2011 —In the span of a year, a lot can change for a relatively new band. Has the sound grown? Have they become more comfortable on stage? Seeing a band after a year, one wonders if anything is dramatically different about them?
The Silver Liners performing at the Rock and Roll Hotel provided a good opportunity to see how much this band has changed in the past year.
In the last year, the Silver Liners released their second EP. Their membership has changed slightly. A documentary film crew seems to be following them around. The band has clearly grown at least in terms of their personal scope. However, they are still a five piece pop/rock band from the DC area and their set is still filled with tight danceable rock songs.
One of the more unique things about the Silver Liners is even in their immediate infancy there was a certain kind of professionalism to the band, almost abnormally so. Despite none of the band members being much older than 25, they’ve always played with a clear goal in mind.
A lot of this stems from front man’s Jay Nemeyer’s drive. Aside from being the band’s lead singer, he’s also been the band’s unofficial mouth piece and by that distinction has been the sole interpreter of the band’s direction.
A year ago, his stage presence was obvious but there was also some stiffness to him. It felt like he was slightly too concerned with making sure the band’s presence was just right. This was balanced on stage by the casual nature of guitarist John Patton and fun energy of bassist Ray Remesch, so it never dominated how the band came off.
Nemeyer now seems more relaxed on stage but still with a certain level of intensity. The clear and diverse personalities of the band is in part what makes the band arresting on stage without settling on coordinated costumes, elaborate stage set-ups, or other garish gimmicks. Another aspect to their professionalism is just how tight they are during their performance. For such a young band, it’s a bit surprising to see them as on point with their songs as they are. There’s rarely any wasted time in songs. The band is in tune with each other enough that even some early technical troubles are virtually undetectable when the rest of the band fills in their roles.
Since the Silver Liners approach has been refined, it’s easy for them to throw interesting curve balls to the audience. At one point during the set, local rapper Dom-o was brought on stage unexpectedly to rap one of the band’s mainstays “Running Through My Head.”
It’s a quirk which keeps anyone familiar with the band on their toes and an open mind for anyone seeing the band for the first time.
The most obvious difference in the band wasn’t anything they played but the addition of new keyboardist Kenny Grim. Keyboard has always been a strong point of the Silver Liner’s sound and one would think it’ll continue to be, but they were largely absent during this show.
Being Grim’s first show with the band, it’s easy to understand he didn’t want to step on the rest of the band’s toes. As they move forward, Grim’s presence will be felt more.
The night closed with the rocker “Hold Your Hand” which is a song Nemeyer wrote before the band was formed. It’s noticeably faster and harder than their normal material. While it’s an older song, it might be a sign of the band’s willingness to push towards something outside of their current sound.
The Silver Liners have refined their sound to this point and it’s time for them to take the next step. Give the band another year and it’ll be interesting to see what new direction they go in..

posted in other group but figured i try here too..
my 5year old son has picked up a cursing and additude habit the past week or two.i first noticed when he told 8month DS "quit your shit" when he was trying to climb on him.i told him that shit is a bad word and i took away all his cars (which he loves) for a week.next was telling his bother he would "kick his ass" if he didnt get off his bike.that one bought him a spanking and no bike.but today was the big one. i took all three of my boys to the pool when they came home from school and i heard potty mouth say "oh shit" when he slipped.i spanked him for it and made him sit on the bench while his twin brother,me and his little brother continued playin in pool.after 30minutes i went to talk to him about this cursing issue of his and he screamed "i fucking hate you" in my face and took off running to our apartment door.once we all got home i brushed his teeth with *THICK* salt water paste i mixed up while he kicked and screamed.that was 2hours ago and he is still sitting dead center of his bed pouting (i really dont care) but im freaking out in my head as he has NEVER been a behavior problem other than being a bit stubborn and now all the sudden he doesnt want anyone talking to him or touching his stuff and he is sooo mean and hatefull im so scared its going to get worse and worse and also scared he may act out toward 8month LO... any advice is extremely welcomed
My first responce would be to ask who he hears these cuss words from. Then whomever it is should stop using these words within earshot of any of the kids. THAT alone will help. My son had one slip over the summer, we hadn't heard him use any bad words... well when I asked him WHO he heard the word from he said that Dad had called a guy that in his truck.(a-hole) So Dh had to then talk to Deagon and explain how he shouldn't have used the word. We did not do a timeout in this case because it was a 1-time thing and he actually asked "Should I call him an a-hole" My eyes about flew out of my head!!!!
I would continue to leave him in his room without any toys to think about what he is saying. I would want him to know how hurtful his words are, and there is no excuse for them. This would be best coming from the person he's heard the words from and he should see that this person also stops. I personally strongly dislike these words and cannot stand hearing them out of adults and teens. But when they come out of children I know it was a learned behavior and they are trying to get attention or they know nothing different.

Ugh..I can so sympathize with your situation. Both of my boys just started daycare in February and since then, they have BOTH been sick almost non freaking STOP! Every other week one is sick with a fever, coughing, throwing up, the runs, pink eye or an ear ache. I lost count of how many times the daycare has called me to come get them. It sucks because our daycare won't allow them to return until 24 hours has passed after their fever. My husband is in school and can only miss so many days so I'm normally the one who has to go get them. I know my supervisor is starting to probably think I'm using them as an excuse to miss so much work or they're getting frustrated but whatever I'm not lying about it have no reason to and even offered to bring them in doctor notes..thankfully though I'm active duty military so they can't fire my ass.
It is a major problem over here too as I had to fo through all my sick days before maternity disablilty kicked in. I can't wait to have some time off next year so this isn't such a big deal. I would start taking more vit D- we find it really helps. We take fermented cod liver oil. You can give it to baby and take it yourself.
I feel your pain on the daycare illness situation! This past winter, my LO has had gastroenteritis, RSV (thankfully, a mild case), and a succession of colds/sniffles, etc. Fortunately, she's only had to stay home twice (for 3 days each time) since starting daycare.
Since being laid off, my husband has been in school part-time, job-hunting and doing temporary jobs here-and-there, so his schedule is a lot more flexible than mine. Luckily, he was able to stay home with our daughter when she was too ill to go to daycare.
@ OP: Have you looked into the possibility of back-up childcare for your LO when she has to stay home sick from daycare? You didn't say in your post what kind of daycare center your LO goes to. A lot of corporate daycare centers offer backup child care (including sick baby care) if your LO is too sick to go to the center. They send someone to your home to care for your ill baby, and you have the reassurance that it's someone who's already been pre-screened by the child care center. Some companies also offer backup child care as an employee benefit. You might try looking into either of these options for backup or emergency child care.

Ashley, Thanks so much! I was just saying that about her name today. That it sounds like an old lady name but she totally rocks it! She could be noone else! I got so much shit for it when I was pregnant that I was bound and determained that it would be her name!
I never answered the sleep talking question.. NOPE dh sleeps like the dead! He does this twitching thing though that used to drive me nuts. Now I would miss it if he wasnt there twitching away.

I'd like to join! This is my first month trying to conceive number 2. It took us 3 cycles for our daughter and I have long cycle, anywhere from 31-35 days. This one seems extra long as im CD22 with no positive OPK yet. I had signs of O from CD13-16 and now again from CD18 until today but still no positive OPK. I have a feeling this won't be my month so next month I want to try soy isoflavones to bring up my O date.
Good luck to everyone. I'd LOVE a summer baby as my daughter was born in winter... and I'd love to walk this new baby outside all summer!
The other reason that summer babies are great is maternity leave is in the summer! LOL. I got preg just a little too soon, otherwise, I would have loved to have a June/July/Aug!
Hoping for a June baby. I'm a teacher and would love to be able to take the whole year off and include two summers as well. Whether or not I can afford it is a whole other story!
I too am hoping for a summer baby -- I was born in july myself so it would be great bday present but I am hoping for summer baby since my 1st child was born in OCT I experienced the horrid heat months in FL while being in my 2nd an 3 tri
not fun! but i will be content with any date/month I can get second time around.

That's normal for my LO - she's been going 4 hours between nursing sessions for a couple months. I'm back at work now, but we nurse at 7:30am before we leave the house, 11:30am over my lunch, 3:30pm LO gets a bottle of bm at daycare, and 6:30pm before bedtime. She's been steadily gaining weight and wetting diapers. LO usually take two long naps a day and sometimes a cat nap about two hours before bedtime.

Yes, we can add them there. But it can get long quickly, and a lot of groups start strong but die quickly. Until you know a group is going to stick around, its usually best to leave them off that list.
Good idea in theory, but what's going to happen when this is no longer the sticky? People won't bump it for long. Then we get new people asking about other groups (or aboout all the Glitter siggys, not realizing it's a group)- their post will be locked, which will cause another thread asking why it's been locked- which will be locked, which will cause another thread about why everyone is so mean- which will be locked.
But in the meantime, won't this just make us discuss breastfeeding, circumcision, and vaccination sooner than normal? Because those threads never get out of hand.
Seems to me like that would cause more work for the GO's?
When the new GOs are elected, they can handle spin-off groups in any way they'd like. Until then, this is how we (IKRAMV and I) have decided to handle it. But thanks for thinking about us and how overworked we are.

I feel like switching our services for internet/cable/phone may have been a mistake...I am sure it will be good once everything is worked out, but right now none of the 3 services is working exactly as they should. Today is going to be spent getting that all fixed.
To-Do:
- Fix Phone/cable/internet
- Finish setting up PVR
- Vacuum
- Call school about stage rental
- Set up new credit card billing system for studio
Tara - GREAT JOB! WOW! I wish I had time to do stuff like that. There are many areas of my hosue that accumulate like that. Currently, my dresser is one (though it's mostly stacked with maternity clothes I have no tote for yet), and my ironing board. Joey's dresser often has a pile as well. Sigh. I haven't worked int eh basement in over a week. I was going to last night, but decided to finish the burp cloths I made for my SIL. I'm the queen of unfinished projects, so I'm glad I finished them. The next 3 weekends are going to be busy too. Bleh!!! Maybe Joey will be happy sitting down there with me for a bit. We'll see.
Mandee - I hope that all gets sorted/fixed!
DHW - I hope DD starts to eat something soon!
LZA - That cake is going to be cute :) Good luck with the baby shower!
Hmm, I know I missed stuff.
Today's to-do's:
- empty dishwasher
- put away laundry
- 15 minutes in master closet (it needs WAY more than that, but I can start at least)
- jewelry & make-up (BAM challenge)
Just popping in to say I'm still alive! I was going to head to the bedroom days ago to take pics, do the mission, and then more pics...well, I never made it to the challenge. I'm swamped with work. I've been neglecting myself though and it stinks. I haven't showered in a few days or changed out of the same PJs. I feel gross. My house is falling apart. But my work is great lol. I need to take this weekend to regroup.
I'm going to do the master bathroom no matter what, just probably over the weekend. I'll still take pics! I'm so embarrassed. Put it this way... I have no clean clothes. You can't see my bedroom floor. Eek!
Jackie - I am soooo sorry to hear about your friend. Did they catch it early? I hope so. I went through breast cancer with my mom (unfortunately they didn't catch it early with her though).

Same experience here. My dd has been potty trained during the day for about a year, nap-time trained for a few months, and we have been experimenting with removing her pull-up at night for the last 10 days (at her request). She is totally not ready for going the whole night without a forced trip to the bathroom (and yes: she still drinks milk for her bedtime routine). One night she was able to wake up at the first sign of wetness, but all the other times she has soaked her bed if I don't go in and take her to the toilet in the middle of the night. I think we'll keep going on this route, as long as she is happy with it (she feels grown-up without a nappy at night :), unless we get to a point where the forced wake-up disturbs her sleep. So far, she has been able to easily go back to sleep after that.
Good to know, DS has been potty trained since August, and just the last few weeks has been nap trained. Wakes up dry occasionally from night, occasionally will come downstairs in the night to potty, but still usually feels like he has wet about once, occasionally it feels like several wets.
Thanks for posting! I came on here just to research nighttime wetting. My son has been daytime and naptime potty trained almost for a year now but is still soaking a pullup at night. It's getting frustrating because his mattress (which was brand new) now smells like urine, even though we have a mattress pad on it.

Seriously then, what should we do? As a nation? should we rename ourselves and start a new history from this year forward, so that slavery isn't part of our history? a public time of mourning for what happened?
I'm not being snarky or nasty. This topic has been bothering me for several days and I can't figure out how to word a post to discuss it, so here's my long ramble :)
It's easy to say, well I never owned a slave, my parents never owned a slave, neither did my grandparents. I'm probably even safe with the next generation, but I flat out know that I'm descended from slave owners in one branch. Not to mention my norse heritage, which has a long history of slavery that seems to be acceptable I've also never known someone that was a slave, or their parents or grandparents were slaves. So why is it still a problem? But, the more I read here, the more that feels like a cop out.
I'm truly at a loss though. I can't see that an apology from me, for something my ancestors did would be meaningful. I'm sure my dad said something stupid to his siblings at some point, but my apologizing would mean nothing to them.
Realistically, would you prefer that we not celebrate the 4th? what about Thanksgiving? after all, we turned around and eliminated the native people that helped us survive those early years. And why is it that no one screams at the Normans for invading Briton, and basically eliminating the Pict's? Is it disrespectful to celebrate?
All over the world, throughout history, civilizations have been enslaved and eliminated by others. Yet, it seems to me that the only one standing with any blame is the good old US of A.
We, as a nation, take a lot of grief for Columbus. I've never understood this. He was employed by the Spanish Crown. Why isn't Spain on the block for destroying the natives?
I guess my question is why do we seem to be the only nation held responsible for actions that were common in others? and for how long will we be held accountable for them?
What would need to be done, to while acknowledge that they happened, let it be history and not current events?
I truly wish that we could start over.... Erase history and begin new. I think that every year that slavery, racism, etc., is discussed, it just perpetuates the cycle.
If it were all erased and the nation started fresh, eventually, as our childrens children grew to be adults, it would be all forgotten and we could move forward.
I am black, but I am not one that is caught up on slavery, separatism, etc. I don't teach my son that he is any different because he is black. I feel no need to discuss slavery, etc. with him, as it is not his current reality. I don't feel the need to go out and buy "black children's books" or take him to the "black circus" or do special "black" things. I feel this will only cause him to be one of the people that won't let "it" die.
Yes, racism still exists, but, the only reason why is becasue of history.
People will continue to bring it up forever. Why? I'm not exactly sure. Dwelling on it will not make it go away. You can't change the past - only the future, yet we seem to be "stuck" in the past.
It is not MY fault what my ancestors may or may not have done. (i honestly don't know if any of them were slave owners) I feel terrible that people were abused and treated like that, but I should not personally have to apologize for something I had no control over.
ETA:
I don't think its possible to "start over" because there are people out there that don't want to move on. They want people to remember how things were - and I agree that education is necessary and that people need to know what happened in the past to get us where we are today. There is just so much emotion involved that its difficult to "remember" without projecting the emotions and all that comes with it into today's world.
I don't disagree with any of your points. My husband and his family descended from slaves but 4 generations ago. He is American and celebrates all American holidays as does his whole family. If they can celebrate life and liberty that is present in our society, why can't everyone else?
i'm only 3rd generation American on one side and Native American on another and i no way feel that i am owed anything because of horrible things that happened to my ancestors. nor, do i feel it my responibility to apologize for horrible atrocities that happend to someone elses ancestors that my lineage have absolutely nothing to do with. i think there is a time where you remember, because nobody should EVER foget, but you start to heal and move on
What would need to be done, to while acknowledge that they happened, let it be history and not current events?
If it were actually JUST history I guess it could be that easy . But in all actuality there are still injustices, intolerance and prejudices against people of color to this day. It hasn't ended. It has just gotten better.
I do not feel like I am owed anything. I hold no grudges. I live my life for TODAY. What happened in the past stays in the past for ME. But I can see how some people still feel bitter and can't/won't let it go!
I am African American, Natice American, and White. (my great-great grandfatehr was a general in the Confederate Army.) That is who I am. I can't be filled with hate towards anybody. I dislike when people allow the past (that they didn't even live in) to consume them.
I honestly do not expect the white people of today to apologize for what their ancestors may or may not have done. It is ridiculous. I deal with today.
I think the reason why it is so difficult for some to let go is because Racism still exists. Jews were persecuted. they were disliked and hated. Now, for the most part, the racism toward Jews is not as prevalent as it is towards African Americans.
I have to disagree with one bit of your post.
I guess my question is why do we seem to be the only nation held responsible for actions that were common in others?
Graet Britain has been going through this for years. think about Ireland and Scotland.
I think this is probably fairly common in most countries. We just hear about America more because we are so good at making asses of ourselves in the press.
My husband and his family descended from slaves but 4 generations ago. He is American and celebrates all American holidays as does his whole family. If they can celebrate life and liberty that is present in our society, why can't everyone else?
ITA!
If it were actually JUST history I guess it could be that easy . But in all actuality there are still injustices, intolerance and prejudices against people of color to this day. It hasn't ended. It has just gotten better.
Either way, your (general) prejudices do not and should not affect me. If we all stopped calling attention to racist remarks, comments and behavior (except in criminal cases), maybe racism wouldn't be so prevalent. Why draw attention to negativity?
sure Great Britain has been going through it, but it seems when it's time to "point fingers" the quickest direction is here.

'''Story and photos by Sgt. Brendan Mackie Combined Taskforce Viper PAO'''
COMBAT OUTPOST LAKARAY, Afghanistan - Afghan Border Police and
International Security Assistance Force members participated in
Operation Southern Strike II in the Spin Boldak district, June 2 to June
16.
The operation, led by the 3rd Kandak of the ABP, focused on
interacting with the local populous as well as disrupting enemy
formations in the vicinity of major passes in the area.
"The major areas of focus were the Ganjitsu Pass, then the P'sha
Pass and obviously the Wonake or Enjergay Pass," said Capt. Sean Nolan,
commander of Company C, 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 2nd
Infantry Division. "These are the major passes in our area that the
enemy uses to push supplies and equipment and men through to support
their fight both in the Spin Boldak area and in Afghanistan proper."
During the operation, 17 insurgents were killed, four suspects were
detained and numerous caches of explosives and weapons were discovered.
Among the recovered contraband includes more than 1,400 lbs of
explosives, 19 personnel mines, 12 pressure plates, four rifles, two
rocket launchers, two directional fragmentation charges, one pistol and
numerous rounds of ammunition.
Miscellaneous components of improvised explosive devices also recovered
include 12 cell phones, 13 power sources, eight blasting caps, eight
motorcycles, 18 feet of detonation cord and 50 feet of lamp cord.
Although these statistics are important, the biggest accomplishment
resides in the performance by the ABP, said Nolan.
"This was our first major operation with them and we were unsure how
things would go at a larger level," he continued. "It was just
impressive on all ends."
During the operation the ABP was able to provide a continuous level of
support to include providing themselves with water, food, fuel as well
as the ability to perform at a tactical and strategic level not seen
before in this district.
"I was very impressed by them," he continued. "What was really exciting
to see, as the operation commenced, [was when] they took more and more
of a lead role."
Early in the operation, the ABP and ISAF forces exploited areas that
were identified through intelligence sources. In those villages, locals
were able to provide the ABP with valuable information about the enemy
and their movements.
"By midway to the end they [ABP] were pointing out objectives," Nolan
added. "They were taking the lead and telling us, 'we need to go here
and do this and that,' to the point where we were actually having to
hold them back to coordinate assets. It was very impressive to see them
really take leadership and ownership within their own area."
Looking forward, the biggest thing to understand is how ready the
Afghans are in taking over the mission, said Nolan.
"They're just looking for us to enable them to win," he said.
"It's no longer the old days of us having to drag them to the objective
and show them what right looks like. They want to go. They know where to
go. They know what to do when they get there."
Although this was the first operation between Nolan's company and the
local ABP, he looks forward to the next installment.
"It excites me for the remainder of my tenure here, and our tenure here
as a company, knowing that we have partners who are just chomping at the
bit, and all we've got to do is enable their success, and that's really
where we want to be."

Phasing out BBCode and going for all-HTML down the road is a good thing, it just needs to work correctly.
People get all sorts of annoyed when they go to edit a post and some new behind the scenes change which they don't care about totally messes it up and causes a load of work for them. Also in general, most users hate changes and it discourages them from posting because they don't want to bother getting to grips with something new.
The most important thing though, and it's been said by everyone here, is it needs to have total backwards compatibility. Parsing some BBCode into HTML but they might not turn out exactly how the BBCode displayed things? Then don't parse them and save it that way, you need to save the original so that the content as it was intended to be displayed isn't lost because of some screw up made in conversion.
I always love to upgrade our forums and get the latest features, but the biggest worry for me is always that some change that has been made (just like this) might cause our users to dislike the forum and thus posting will go downhill. It's also not IPS that takes the blame when this happens, our users hold us responsible and we suffer for it as well.

Hi everyone.
Not sure where to post this one.
During the cashback redemption process for the purchase of N360E i found a little
typo in a part of the form.
I think it should say- What security were you using before. Not where.
I hope that info helps to fix a typo error.
Cheers
Solved! Go to Solution.

Hi smithy, could you check to make sure it's fixed? Thanks.
07-30-2012 08:10 PM
Hi Tony
I have tried to check the spelling to see if it has been corrected, but
to get to that step of the redemption process i first require a product
key to use that has not already been processed with the redemption
process. I have already used mine.
The offer finishes today the 31-07-2012.
Unless you can provide me with a product key for N360E i am unable
to check on it for you.:-(
If i can assist anymore let me know.
Cheers.
07-31-2012 10:54 AM
Ahh I see. It should be OK, I just wanted to know if you were able to see it. Our team has confirmed the fix. Thanks for letting us know about it.

Hi Snooze, just wandering wether you've had any feed back from microsoft on theiir progress?
Nothing yet. I am looking forward to it though! As soon as I do I will post here.
Thankyou for taking the time to get back to me. Yep I know that feeling! (-:
Just over a month and no correspondence yet.
Jason,
I understand what you're saying but I think we need to show a wee bit more of a sense of urgency to fix something that plenty of evidence suggests is broken.
Jason,
I find your comment to be a little insulting. Have you not followed this thread and my attempts to the options that we have invented?
Also, I was unaware that there were "releases" to the software. I thought that because everything was web based that updates and changes to an existing platform would be able to be made whenever they were needed.
Snooze,
Good point - enhancements can wait for "releases" - fixing things that are known to not work properly can't. All this requires is removing 7 characters from the code the slideshow script outputs: <p></p>
Why do people have to wait for that?
Well said, this issue has clearly gone on to long with no resolve. I have also put in a service request for this issue, I have received response back from them and although it is a relief to actually be dealing with a human being over the phone and not just representatives who seem not to have read the queries properly or reply with irrelavant, impartial or some times utterly useless information! (If you have read all my previous discussions on the forums you will understand my frustration) The issue is still not resolved.
I must say though, although unable to resolve the issue as yet the chaps I have dealt with in more recent communication since the service request have been very good and dispite having not yet come to a conclusion are still taking steps to help and have been a pleasure to deal with.
If the fault is with the programming in effect this is false advertising is it not? Perhaps a case for Trading standards, if not for the issue itself then with the level of customer service! Certainly prior to submitting a service request. (Not being overly technical minded, certainly with programming! I do not wish to be trying to re-write programs for Microsoft and don't feel we should have to even attempt it, particually as potential mis-haps are not covered, however I have tried everything else possible).
Does anyone else also have have the privacy problem that when, say a potential client enters our website into their browser, along with the website results in the listings are my conversations on these forums. This is both very unprofessional and embarrasing, surely they should only be viewable to paying customers who are logged in to Microsoft 365 and not the entire world?!
I do apologise for the essay I could go on, however this problem has been ridiculously time consuming enough not to mention stressful.
Dear Snooze,
Have you had any luck resolving this issue?
Kind regards,
Janine.
I have not and it seems that the admins have forced this issue to be ANSWERED? Umm.. no.
I don’t mean to be rude, but YES.... Microsoft has the issue in hand and has quizzed multiple people on the issue to verify its existence as well as troubleshoot potential work arounds described in this thread. NO the questions and concerns have NOT been answered.
Watch, that problem will not be fixed, for in a few months Office 365 is being replaced with Office 365 / 2013.
Everything
is going to change. From team
site to online storage and website editor.

Harold Austin: always a new idea
Seattle Times staff reporter
Harold Turner Austin, a machinist who helped invent dozens of aircraft-enhancing parts in his 40 years with Boeing - including a ridged nose wheel that revolves in the wind to soften landings - didn't cap the creative juices when he went home for the day.
Instead, he'd head for his welding shop and work on private projects, such as a portable gurney with pop-down wheels that still is used in ambulances and hospitals.
Mr. Austin died Tuesday (Feb. 8) of heart failure. He was 85.
He liked to buy and tinker with aluminum, tin and other surplus materials after World War II.
"In addition to his work at Boeing, he was always chasing his dreams," said his son Alvan Austin of Puyallup. "His imagination (was) endless, and then there is his support of `causes' - the environment, politics, humanity."
To delight his son, Mr. Austin once welded together two oil cans and mounted them on a beam bolted to a hub, thus creating a prototype for what became the Jet Plane carnival ride.
In the late 1940s, he and several other Boeing employees developed the finished product, which starts vertically like a Ferris wheel and rotates to the horizontal while planes orbit the center. He also created other carnival rides.
"He was very industrious and inventive," said a former colleague, John McFarland. "He was always entertaining us with his ideas."
Mr. Austin recently invented a plow that makes cup-like furrows to hold water and thwart erosion. He also pioneered a motorized wheelbarrow with a clawed wheel that climbs trees and banks.
"Harold was right on the fringe of greatness," said McFarland. "We used to say, `If we're so smart, how come we're not rich?' Truth was, he was an idea man, not a marketing or business man. But he was happy and led a good life."
Born in Midland, N.C., Mr. Austin moved as a teen to California. In the mid-1930s, he worked in Seattle as a logger. He got the idea for the broaster while watching a steam donkey as he gnawed a dry steak sandwich for lunch. He quit his job and put together an oven that blows pressurized hot air into meat to cook it in seconds, retaining its juices.
According to McFarland, Mr. Austin sold the idea to Col. Harlan Sanders, who worked in a Seattle restaurant in the 1940s before founding his fried-chicken empire.
Mr. Austin became a Boeing machinist in 1940, doing his own work on the side. He retired in 1980.
Also surviving are children Harold Austin, Marion, Ohio; Mary Ann Spies, East Wenatchee; and Robert Austin, Seattle; sister, Anita Brooks, Midland, N.C.; 10 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, Marie Austin, died in 1999. His daughter Karon Barton died in 1996.
Services are at 1 p.m. Sunday at Yarington's Funeral Home, 10708 16th Ave. S.W., Se<<

I believe kids are ok!
Hi Eithne,
I'm not sure the age of your children, but if 16 and above is the age for participants due to safety reason. If they are old enough, please bring them and let me know.
See you on Friday!

A student admitted to Barnard with fewer than 24 points of credit is considered a first-year student and is subject to all requirements for first-year students, including First-Year Seminar and two semesters of Physical Education. A student admitted with 24 credits or more is considered a transfer student. To receive the A.B. degree at Barnard, a transfer student must be enrolled at Barnard (Morningside Heights, Reid Hall, Kyoto, Beijing, or the Berlin Consortium) for at least four full-time regular academic terms during which she must complete at least 60 points, including at least six courses in the major field (and three in the minor field, if a minor is elected). Additional major (and minor) courses, as well as general education requirements, may be satisfied by transfer courses. Transfer students are eligible for general honors when both overall and Barnard averages meet the required academic standards.
Courses completed at other accredited colleges and universities which are similar in content and depth to Barnard courses may be submitted for transfer credit. Transfer courses are evaluated after a complete official transcript is received in the Office of the Registrar. Students are asked to submit course descriptions with their requests for transfer credit to the Admissions Office.
Credit for approved work at another institution is applied to Barnard’s graduation requirement with a maximum of 16 points per term. Credit is exception to this ruling.
Transfer students who entered Barnard in or after Autumn 2003 with fewer than 24 points need 122 points to graduate, and one of those points is for PE, either at the previous school or here. Those entering with 24 or more points must complete 121 points for the Barnard degree, and 1 of those points is for PE (1 is both the minimum and the maximum).
Transfer students may apply for credit for previous summer courses under the regulations governing summer study.
First-year students with a record of prior course work taken as non-matriculants at an accredited college in the United States may request up to 15 points of transfer credit (the courses must be intended primarily for college students and taught at the college by members of its faculty, and must be in excess of the courses required for the high school diploma). Such work will be evaluated after the student has completed 12 points at Barnard. Grades for this course work are included in the overall average.

DOS and Windows, despite being harder to use than the Apple Mac, soundly defeated the Mac in sales in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, the competition was over. Microsoft had won. And it is still dominant today.
The paradox is not why the techies did not use the Mac (I used DOS because it had a command-line). The paradox is why ordinary corporate and home users did not buy the Mac, which would have made their lives easier.
David Gelernter has an interesting theory in The Aesthetics of Computing, 1998 (Ch.2, "The Paradox of Beauty"). He suggests that Windows won because the Mac was too easy to use, at a time when computers were meant to be hard to use.
He makes the comparison with cars, where every advance in ease-of-use, such as electric starters and even closed tops, was resisted by the "macho" car culture, which preferred cars to be hard to use. We see this even today, where computerised control in cars is resisted by Europeans, who prefer to do by hand many tedious jobs - such as managing the clutch and engine speeds - that could be handled by a computer.
For me, UNIX is easier to use than either the Mac or DOS/Windows because of its powerful programmable command-line. I didn't actually find the Mac easy to use, since it didn't allow me write short command-line scripts.
This leads to another reason why the Mac may have failed: It was too extremist in having (until Mac OS X) no command-line at all, and forcing you to use windows and menus instead of just having it as an option. The Mac had an extremist philosophy, whereas DOS/Windows and UNIX were more tolerant of multiple different styles of interface. I say that the Mac is a better user interface, but of course I'm saying (patronisingly) that it's a better interface for other people. I don't really believe it's a better interface for me.
So maybe the Mac lost because it lost the power users (programmers, sysadmins), who preferred UNIX and DOS throughout the 1980s-90s. Not because they were being macho, but because no-command-line really isn't a good interface for power users.
But why did ordinary users follow the power users?
Because the OS is so fundamental to all applications, there).

You might agree, but that's not the point. The point is that YouTube has massive and unaccountable power to decide what people can see.

Connecticut College News
Professor of the Week: David Canton - Ben Eagle ´0902/16/2009
David Canton, Assistant Professor of History at Connecticut College, was chosen for The College Voice´s inaugural "Professor Profile." Canton, who completed his undergraduate degree at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Ga., specializes in the civil rights movement and urban history. He is currently teaching "The History of Hip Hop Music and Culture in Post Industrial America 1973-Present" and a seminar in "The Black Freedom Struggle 1946-1968." Voice: When did you realize you wanted to pursue a career in the academic realm? David Canton: I wanted to become a history professor during my senior year in college. I was a biology major and wanted to become a doctor, but my passion was history. Professor Joseph Windham was my professor at Morehouse and he was a young professor who had just completed his Ph.D. at Howard University. We talked about academia and after that I was hooked. He said it was pro family and you get to shape young minds. I have made the right decision. Voice: You joined the Connecticut College faculty in 2003, how do you think the school has changed since then? Canton: The school has increased its commitment to diversity. There are a number of new programs, such as the POSSE program and Men´s Diversity Leadership Network. In addition, the college is hiring a number of faculty of color for next year. The school has added the Women´s Center and the LGBTQ. The future is bright for Connecticut College. Voice: For underclassmen who haven´t declared their major yet, can you give three reasons that they should become history majors? Canton: History improves your reading, writing, and thinking skills. When one goes to the doctor, they ask for your medical history in order for them to make an accurate diagnosis. If a problem occurs at work, one must understand the history of the dispute. If you are a businessperson, one must be able to understand the history of a particular stock. A psychologist must understand a person´s social history in order to assess its impact on their patient. Voice: You received your Masters degree from Ohio State University. How do you feel about Michigan? Canton: I root for Ohio State, but as a graduate student I was not as involved with Ohio State football. Voice: You are currently teaching a course in the history of hip hop. Have developments in technology (YouTube, iTunes) made teaching contemporary history courses like this easier? Canton: I can access any video on YouTube or song on iTunes. It makes it easier; however, I have to find the balance between showing videos and having discussions in class. At the very least, I can tell students to watch the videos in their dorm. Voice: In the same course, you ask your students to write a rap. What is the best line you´ve ever received for that assignment? Canton: That is an excellent question. I was concerned with the quality of rhymes when I gave the assignment, but the students did an excellent job. Some gave battle rhymes and others wrote about their hometown. Voice: According to the College website, your most recent article appears in Pennsylvania History, Volume 75. Can you tell me what that article is about? Canton: This article examined a school desegregation case in Berywn, Pa., in 1934. Raymond Pace Alexander, a black attorney from Philadelphia filed law suit against the Berwyn school district. In 1932, the school district built a brand new school but did not allow black students to use it. The black parents boycotted the school for two years and eventually the school district desegregated. Segregation was not only a southern problem, but a national one as well. Voice: I know professors are supposed to spend all their time reading and researching, but do you have any favorite TV shows? Canton: Some of my favorite TV shows are Entourage, The Shield, Nip/Tuck, ER, Book TV, and Everybody Hates Chris. Voice: And lastly, for those that aren´t in your history of hip hop class, who´s an essential artist for any hip hop collection? Canton: Rakim, KRS One, and A Tribe Called Quest

"My point is, that the inmates are calling the shots,"
Hagar, don't be naive, of course they are calling the shots.
Jail is different but in prison, the inmates rule.
Nothing will change that, not more money, not more guards.
All we can do is make it as safe as possible for the legal citizens working inside.
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be convicts.
Size matters.
But we have bigger beer! Quit yer whining!
The sky is falling.......again
I've read several different scenarios of what happened that day and Dman722b, what you are reading here is barely a mention. Don't judge the victim by what was reported in The News. I guess The News should receive kudos for their random act of journalism, albeit way too late.
If your tax return is audited, the state will make you pay the taxes. The auditor will look at your bank account detail, to see purchases made out of state using your debit card, they will do the same with your credit card statements. They can do it. But they have to catch you. Who wants to take the chance? $40 on $1,000 purchase, what's the problem? Pay it, we need the money
Rolando, get you some new friends or next you may be the white outline on the murder map.
Grow up and act right before its too late.

If the citizens of Alabama want this scourge gone, they should find a way to make it happen.
If he changed his life, why is he still wearing his thug costume--- big white shirt to cover up what he might be carrying in his waistband and I bet he's sagging. His life is a long way from being changed. Keep working on that Good Enough Diploma

Most violent?? He killed 2 old, defensive women, how bad do you have to be?? He needs to be in the basement with the rats and cockroaches. They'll make short work of him. He's getting way more attention than he deserves.
Why don't they put on their billboard "ok thugs, time to man up and be a role model"
Mr Young must have p.o'd the godfather to get sent to this cesspool. I bet his family stays in NJ
For the ones who want to know how the Collins' family benefits?

Alabama is like a crack/meth head. When you run out of drugs and money (revenue), you resort to doing something illegal, like stealing (slot machines). I'm sorry, that's not a plan.
Vote for either or neither, the real power is in the Legislature. I want to see Kay Ivey tear into Foghorn Leghorn Folsom--- now that's a debate.
delete "Koran"
insert "county commission"
all others >>> do not pass GO
Most of the convicts in Draper have been convicted of a violent crime, many of them multiple violent crimes. They didn't behave on the outside, what makes you think they will behave in the inside? Same with Holman. The baddest of the bad go to those 2 prisons. They are not in there beause they won a spelling bee. I don't think we should over-react.

The County needed a whole lot of fat trimmed from its budgets. A meat cleaver is a good start. Unfortunately, for many laid off county employees they felt the blade first. Now, let's trim the administration and legal departments who await like the fated calf.
Illegal aliens are afforded protection under the US laws. However, where many go astray, like the amnesty group or perhaps the writer above, is these illegal aliens do not have all of the RIGHTS of legal citizens - therefore their designation as Illegal Aliens and not citizens.
To carry the writers statement to its conclusion, why have citizenship at all if all you have to do is sneak into America.
Crime and criminals are becoming the victims now days with the press and other groups portraying Americans citizens as the enemy of decency and poor people. Nothing could be farther from the truth. America is a country of laws and the rest of the world needs to follow OUR laws if they intend on coming here or living here.
This story is in keeping with continued the liberal bent of Da Snooze. Also, in this light, Mary, you need to bone up on your facts if you are going to attempt to lie and mislead citizens. Thankfully, the internet provides thousands of examples of how illegal aliens are stealing tens of billions of dollars in services from the USA.....annually.
Take the blinders off. See the illegal alien situation for what it really is. I know that Da Snooze has little use for the facts, it's really more about your little liberal feelings than anything else.
Maybe Mary you will be able to find a job writing books of fiction...like this so called story.
Commend the county AFTER they hold the meeting NOT before. When the last commissioners convened the public bankruptcy hearings many citizens were humiliated by some of the commissioners. Some of the commissioners had already made up their minds on the matter and were talking on cell phones and not paying attention.
Now, let's see if these new commissioners will really listen to the public of NO INCREASED SEWER RATES>
A forlorn lover pours his heart out to his lover.....a blind and deaf old prostitute who takes her comfort from anyone promising money. So, the saga continues and the circle is unbroken.
Sorry John, but if you are gonna print only 3 days a week you have to do better than that.
YIKES!!! The County has been "sapped" by the financial crisis. LOL
Am I the only one asking "Why NOW?" all of these little things are just now creeping up? They have an agenda at the county commission and that is to make US as miserable as possible so we all will rise up and beg Montgomery to give these morons home rule.
Not on a cold day in Hades. Keep'em all poor until the last one runs out of the commission chambers door going home for good.
Joey, your Alabama bashing and name calling of the state's residents is repugnant and boorish.
OK, so YOU have a left wing agenda. Go sell that in New York or California. It is falling on deaf ears in a conservative state and it appears that YOU have cost your newspaper enough readership that they have had to downsize to printing Da Snooze 3 days a week. Whatever will I do to line my puppy kennel floor on the days Da Snooze is not printed?
The illegal immigrants cost Alabama citizens tens of millions of dollars annually in health, food, social services and educational services. However, your zeal has blinded you to these facts and led many previous readers of the news to abandon it for the internet - thus costing jobs at your employer - another cost of the illegal alien rant of yours.
Anytime you bring 40,000 - 80,000 illegal aliens into a system that they are totally unprepared for, such as language, education, housing, child services and on and on, these people are going to add a tremendous cost to that system. And they have added huge amounts of costs regardless of your blind nay sayings.
The Alabama law, while not perfect because none truly are, is a start. Like all laws they will be refined and remade into the image of newly elected representatives as time goes on. Until such time as all people see the law as rational and worthwhile.
And to paraphrase your words above, YOU should not be so hardheaded that YOU can't understand this.
Name calling has never been the best approach. However, YOU have taken it to a new high by slighting the very people you wish to buy your newspaper. Not a good marketing program that!
My son is a combat wounded Iraq/Afghanistan veteran with multiple injuries. When we went to the VA to sign him up for medical coverage the lady stated to him "this is NOT the DOD. This is the VA and our rules are totally different." Several months later he is still trying to get his benefits and all he gets is excuses. I overheard several veterans complaining about the "attitude" of the staff and the service offered. However, many have only VA insurance and they have to live with this "attitude" of we will get to you when we can make time for you.
It is a national shame the way our veterans are treated. Many have wounds that will never heal and yet they are treated to surly intake people, months of waiting for someone to decide if their wounds were actually received in a war and other stalling tactics, and lame excuses that "we are backed up", you will just have to wait.
These brave men and women placed their lives on the line for everyone of us. They deserve a medical delivery system that is more courteous, respectful and a damned sitre faster in giving them their due benefits.
“I never thought it would be that much.”
It is easy living when all you have to do is borrow the money. And this guy wants us to believe that he never knew his loan was going to be this expensive?? Come on.
It took me 10 years but I paid back every penny of my student loan. These young people need to be real inventive, as I did, to make a living.
The school board and it's administrative employees have always been "patronage" jobs for the mayor.
Education in Birmingham has always been about the jobs never the children. Look at all of the "programs" that have been developed over the years to supposedly address the needs of underperforming students and you will see those programs stuffed with political appointees and others.
Now, consider the dropout rate, 53%, and you can see where your money has been wasted.
Good article John.
The web site is an unmitigated disaster. Whoever thought up that one needs to be tossed from the the top of the News building. Da Snooze has been relegated to "rag" from "fish wrapper" which means it is not relevant. Ergo, printed 3 days a week.
Da Snooze has been asleep at the wheel for some time now. It seems like most of their writers cater to left wing ideology and subscriber bashing. That is one sure way to ruin your business model......step on your readers and offend your advertisers.............which destroys your revenues.
Joey, could it be that YOU are out of touch with the general public?? Here is a quote from the AP from 5-28-2012:
" Poll after poll shows public support for same-sex marriage steadily increasing, to the point where it's now a majority viewpoint. Yet in all 32 states where gay marriage has been on the ballot, voters have rejected it."
People may tell you they favor gay marriage but in the 32 states where it has been put to a vote - the voters have overwhelmingly rejected it and will continue to do so. Why is it you have such a hard time understanding this? People are not born gay. It is a choice.
Yet, you castigate people who are against your position on this issue. Who set you up as the arbiter of all that is right for Alabama?
"One of the law's unintended and embarrassing consequences was the arrest of a Mercedes-Benz official from Germany visiting the company's plant near Tuscaloosa. He wasn't carrying proper papers."
This guy would have been held anyway - he simply didn't have ANY documents and he was released later.
."
You guys need to get your line of BS straight. The long lines at Jefferson County courthouses was due to employee cut backs NOT illegal aliens.
Its a wonder Da Snooze can get published even 3 days a week.
Well, it looks like the commissioners have been working overtime to try and come up with new ways to take our money.
Spurned on the employment tax, they now turn to raising sewer rates 8.2% a year for 3 years.
Any of you readers getting pay increases like that? I didn't think so.
John, some bard wrote "Change is inevitable." Since the birth of the personal computer and the internet, the world, as many of us know it, has changed drastically. Most for the good. Some of it not so good.
Early in this century the printed newspapers held sway over people on a daily basis because they were the only game in town. Later, computers and a connection to the internet placed the news of the world instantly at your fingertips thus relegating the newspaper to reporting "history" or events that had happened literally hours ago. Change had come to the print news business.
No matter how we obtain our news in the future, there will always be a need for clear, concise and cogent writing by an unbiased source willing to dig for the truth.
Keep on keeping on. It's a brave new world!!
If this teacher is found guilty he should be jailed for life. This is so sick!
The SPLC is now a quoted "source"?
Anyway you look at it, the law is not perfect. It never will be as it affects too many people in this state. BUT, it is the law now. It is a start for Alabama, at least, to start to gain control of illegal immigration within our borders.
Common Sense has left the building!!! (along with Elvis)
JeffCo is too top heavy in management personnel with ridculous salary and benefit packages. PLUS, when you consider that the County Attorney rakes in $375,000 a year - just think of the salaries he is paying his staff attorneys - who in turn hire all of their law school buddies to do the real work.
Consider all of the "administrative assistants" ( read political appointments) wandering around with all of the department heads and you have millions of dollars a year in overhead you could trim.
JeffCo has the money. There is just zero will to get rid of the real non-performers and political appointees that pile on costs for the taxpayers to absorb.
And yes, I agree, JeffCo has no business being in any sort of medical business.
The nitwits on the county commission had to blame someone!! I mean they are all geniuses, right??
JeffCo is going to have to finds it's own way out of this financial labyrinth and it won't be through increased taxing of county residents.
I have lived in and around Birmingham and Jefferson County for over 6 decades and I, for one, could not sleep at night knowing that the Jefferson County Commissioners held taxing authority. One only has to look at the way they mishandled the sewer construction which ballooned from $1 Billion to over $3 Billion and all of the graft and corruption that accompanied it to know that these people are no more adept at being good stewards of our public money than Washington is.
I would rather leave it in the (in) capable hands of the few in Montgomery than have hundreds of new taxing authorities throughout the state with thousands of additional greedy hands wanting to steal our money.

By Anne Collier
It's arresting to think about what Stewart Wolf, M.D. – discovered and presented at medical conferences, as told by Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers – in the context of social media and online safety today. Back in the 1950s, he found a community in Pennsylvania statistically very free of the No. 1 medical concern of the time, heart disease, and looked into what was going on there. When Wolf presented his research, he found that his skeptical colleagues "weren't thinking about health in terms of community [emphasis Gladwell's]." Now sub in (online) "safety" for "health": "Wolf and [his co-researcher, sociologist John]...."
Now add the online piece A child's (anybody's) safety and wellbeing have a lot to do with his community offline and online, since the research shows that our online social networks are largely our offline ones.
Almost echoing Dr. Wolf, USATODAY reports that, "for the most part, being part of a social network is good for you....." And the co-authors of a new book, Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives, report that so much of what we think of as individual, e.g., body shape, politics, happiness, are really "collective phenomena."
About peer groups, not technology The USATODAY piece is balanced, pointing to author and Iowa State University prof. Michael Bugeja's concern that we're not looking at online social networks enough from a computer-science perspective. But what we're addressing in the field of youth online safety is much more about young people's interests, social groups, and home and school environments than about computer science – as pointed out in last year's Internet Safety Technical Task Force review of Net-safety research through last year.
The studies in the USATODAY article that look at community are more helpful to moving the youth-risk discussion forward, suggesting that we consider three things: the impact of an individual's community (online and offline) on his or her well-being; how the individual affects the community; and how the community functions and addresses problems for its members (as a group of people, not a site or technology).
The guild effect On that third item, author and USC media professor Henry Jenkins made the point at our Online Safety & Technology Task Force meeting in Washington this month that online communities themselves tend to shape members' behavior to protective effect, e.g., through social norming or influencing, behavior modeling, and peer pressure or ostracism. Educators who play World of Warcraft tell me this community self-regulation certainly happens in the "guilds" of that massively multiplayer online game.
So when we work in the field of youth online safety, it might be helpful to think about young people, its intended beneficiaries, in context – as participants in their online/offline communities rather than potential victims, as we have so much in the past. As for those communities: there may be times when outside intervention (from, say, friends, parents, or Customer Service) is necessary but other times when a little time is needed to allow the community itself to sort out how to deal with antisocial behavior. The other piece that needs more consideration is how to encourage youth to develop a "guild effect" in their online environments, so they're invested in the wellbeing of the community and fellow members, as well as themselves.
From interest-driven to friendship-driven Not that they aren't already doing this. "Kids play socially.... We're growing a bunch of people who see what they do as social and collaborative and as part of joining communities," said author and Arizona State University literacy studies professor James Paul Gee in an interview with PBS Frontline for "Digital Nation." He talks about how young people quite naturally function in "teams," where "everybody is an expert in something but they know how to integrate their expertise with everybody else's; they know how to understand the other person's expertise so they can pull off an action together in a complicated world."
What this suggests to me is that "the guild effect" (safe, civil behavior as a social norm) kicks in quite naturally in "interest-driven" social networking, one of the two forms of social networking described in last year's study from the Digital Youth Project (see "*Serious* informal learning"). The question is, how can the guild effect be just as effective in "friendship-driven" social networking and across the entire social Web, fixed and mobile? I think this may be the central question for online safety going forward.

Economic wages
From Conservapedia
Economic wages are payments for the worker's opportunity cost of time.
For example, if the best job Charles can find is to earn $7 per hour working for a dry cleaners, then those wages are payments for his opportunity cost of time. He could be working somewhere else making less money. The market rate of $7 implies that his time is worth that much at this stage in his life for his level of experience and education.

Professional wrestling
From Conservapedia
Professional wrestling is a violent form of entertainment, in which entertainers appear to be having an athletic contest. In actuality, they are performing a script, and the bout nearly always reaches an agreed-upon outcome. It is not a real contest in the manner of sports such as boxing or amateur wrestling, but many bouts take a gruelling toll on the participants' bodies nonetheless.
For most of the twentieth century, professional wrestling was portrayed to the viewing public as 'real', often despite featuring laughably outlandish characters and obvious fakery; in this form it could be seen as deceitful and thus inconsistent with Christian values. However, in the present day the overwhelming majority of fans are 'in' on the secret, but still watch in appreciation of the entertainment value, athletic prowess and sometimes humor on display.
History
Professional wrestling got its start on the county fair circuits, where collegiate wrestlers used to put on fights for paying audiences. Eventually, the trade began to develop into a profitable business. With stars now worth millions of dollars, the violence and danger was slowly replaced with theatrical combat, allowing wrestlers to appear multiple times a day and perform several times a week without suffering serious injury.

Talk:Biology and creation
From Conservapedia
Surely we need to qualify young earth and old earth creationists here? Because young earth creationists cannot agree with the biology of mutation rates, unless somehow suggesting that mutation rates were far higher, and constantly more beneficial just after the flood? Old earth creationists can perhaps accept all the same science as an evolutionist, except that of abiogenesis, but I suspect more often than not they believe that the animals have been design, and the hand of god has guided evolution, which is not a belief held by evolutionists.
I'm positive there are many other aspects of biology that young earth creationists would disagree upon.Raggs 12:45, 9 April 2008 (EDT)
- Sorry, I don't understand. What is the "biology of mutation rates"? And why is that relevant to the article? --Ed Poor Talk 12:51, 9 April 2008 (EDT)
- I assume Raggs means the rate at which mutations occur, and that would be relevant if there have only been a few thousand years since the flood. But I came here to say something a little different - surely it cannot be true that "Creationist biologists accept all the biology that an evolutionist accepts" - given that evolution plays such a central part in modern biology, as an underpinning theory and an observed fact. The article almost seems to be saying "Creationist biologists accept all the biology that an evolutionist accepts, except for the biology"! Humblpi 12:59, 9 April 2008 (EDT)
- To answer your question on my usertalk (may as well state it here), I've got a zoology degree, have worked in the field of prosimians and am planning on starting a phd soon (hell I hope to become a professor one day, so perhaps I'm not worth listening to ;)). Also I've discussed this and these topics a fair old bit. Humblpi has basically got it. Mutation rates are pretty damn constant, not just in mammals but bacteria as well, the reason they evolve so much faster is their amazingly rapid generation time compared to ours. In short, if you're dealing with a 4000 year time period, mutation rates must have been through the roof (not only a very tiny population to work with, but also a hell of a lot to diversify to), and somehow avoid negative mutations (which are far more dangerous in small populations than large ones). YEC would have a lot of problems with biology (all related to evolutionary concepts, but there are a few). OEC can indeed accept every part of biology unscathed (depending of course on their beliefs). It just seems like a very short article, containing barely any information, and that which is contained needs to be qualified in many places.Raggs 14:01, 9 April 2008 (EDT)
Creationist biologists accept all the biology that an evolutionist accepts, but disagrees on how living things came about. That is, they agree on the observable facts, not on the unobserved history.
- But the claim that "evolution plays such a central part in modern biology, as an underpinning theory" is simply rhetoric, with little basis in fact. See here for more. And (molecules to man) evolution is not an "observed fact". Nobody has ever seen a creature evolved into a different kind of creature.
- I'm curious about Raggs' claim of bacteria evolving fast: What have we seen bacteria evolving into (i.e. becoming something other than bacteria)? The point is, despite the rapid generation time, we have not seen them evolve (i.e. change into something else), yet if evolution were true, surely that's exactly what we would expect. In effect, it's a prediction of evolution that has been falsified.
- I don't understand the comment about mutation rates being through the roof if you're dealing with a 4,000-year time period. It seems to be suggesting that creationists believe that everything evolved from the first living thing, just as evolutionists claim, but over a period of 4,000 years. If this is what Raggs is saying, he is just showing his gross ignorance of the idea that he so readily tries to point out problems with. YECs don't believe in (molecules to man) evolution at all.
- Philip J. Rayment 22:51, 9 April 2008 (EDT)
- Come now, stop trying to make me out to be ignorant and merely land yourself there instead. We have seen bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics, they don't need to become anything other than bacteria, and they have still evolved. Evolution doesn't have to lead to bacteria becoming anything else (or even multicelluar), you are using a misconceived definition of evolution I'm afraid.
- As Humbli stated, and as I would have thought to be obvious, the 4000 year figure comes from the flood. We have pairs of animals, now unless you claim noah manage to fit two (or seven or fourteen of some animals), of every species that exists today, then he must have taken two of every "kind" (at whatever point creationists decide to define as a kind at the time). Now if we only have two to start with, and a lot of species to get to, then we need a lot of mutation to achieve the species variety in such a short time, and even more so because we are dealing with tiny populations. So if you are willing to state creationist biologists believe in everything evolutionists believe in, except molecules to man, then they would also accept mutation rates, however they cannot agree with biologists on these things due to the reasons I've just stated. Mutation is an observable event. Mutation rates are observable. The mechanism of replication is observable. So unless the replication systems have changed a great deal in the past few thousands years (in order to slow down speciation (more comfortable a word for you as opposed to evolution?)), then YEC biologists must argue mutation rates.
- And to be honest, I'd like to go back to when mutation was extremely fast, and apparently almost never bad. Because that's another important thing you have to consider, with a large population and slow mutation you have a good buffer to survive negative mutations (doesn't matter if some animals just don't make it), when dealing with a very small population, in which almost every animal has some serious mutations, then you're facing big trouble.Raggs 02:16, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- Your comments show that you don't know the basics of creationist arguments, so "ignorant" is quite appropriate. The whole point of evolution is that all living things evolved from the first living thing, the evolutionary "family tree". If that were true, then given the generation rates of bacteria, you should, as I said, expect to see bacteria evolved into something else. Yet you don't, as you now admit.
- To put that in more precise terms, the first living cells would not have had the genetic information for hair, blood, and lungs, to pick just three examples. So between bacteria and humans (etc.) evolution has to add enormous amounts of new genetic information. The question is, can we identify mechanisms that can produce this information?
- First, the simply answer is "no". Mutations either have no informational effect, or they destroy information. This has been observed over and over. In other words, a key prediction of evolution is falsified.
- Second, bacteria having resistance to antibiotics does not involve the generation of new genetic information. In many cases, a few members of the population already had the resistance. The antibiotic wiped out the ones without the resistance, and only the ones with the resistance were able to reproduce, so now a large part of the population are resistant to the antibiotic. But there was no new information generated. So it is not "molecules to man" evolution.
- Third, when two creatures mate and produce offspring, each of the offspring inherit half the genetic information from each parent. None of the offspring have a full complement of the genetic information of their parents. If environmental pressures wipe out individuals with certain characteristics (such as short fur in a cold environment), the genetic information that is not in the ones that survive is lost. So if two populations of creatures that started out together end up in different environments with different selection pressures, each population ends up being a little (or not so little) different to the other. Depending on how different, we might classify them as different species. But in all this process of speciation, no new genetic information has been generated, and no mutations were involved.
- Mutations do occur, however, and could also affect the above process, causing even further genetic information to be lost than just that lost from selection pressure on inherited subsets of the information. But again, this is a loss of information, not a gain, and cannot explain the evolutionary family tree from the first living thing to humans, birds, and pomegranates.
- So the various species that exist today are indeed descended from the fewer kinds that were on the ark, but not from a process that can explain the evolutionary family tree, and much of it not from mutations. Mutations, and mutations rates, both of which have been observed, are not the issue. The issue is whether or not mutations can produce the evolutionary family tree. That is the (claimed) history, and has not been observed.
- Again, this is pretty basic YEC creationism, and if you're not aware of that, you really don't have a clue about the idea that you are attempting to refute.
- Philip J. Rayment 06:42, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- I think this reinforces the point I made near the top of this discussion. The beliefs of creationists and mainstream biologists/evolutionists are so far apart that it is simply not true to say that "Creationist biologists accept all the biology that an evolutionist accepts, but disagree on how living things came about." I am not here to argue about who is right, just to point out the size of the gap. I think that gap is so large that the thesis of the article is simply nonsense. [[User:|Humblpi]] 07:12, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- That can only be true if evolution makes up a large part of biology. I addressed that above with a link. Here are further examples.[1][2] The claim that evolution is a large part of biology is simply not true. Philip J. Rayment 07:21, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- Humblpi, We weren't talking about their beliefs, if by that you mean their own philosophical speculations about the history of life on earth (see Origins debate).
- "Creationist biologists accept all the biology that an evolutionist accepts, but disagree on how living things came about."
- Leaving aside what the article says to leave aside (wink), the article asserts that there is no other area of disagreement between biologists who accept and reject evolution. Since this is not a debate page, let us confine our discussion to ways in which we can improve this article.
- If you are aware of an aspect of biology other than the historical question of how living things came about originally, on which there is disagreement between pro- and anti-evolution biologists, then you are duty bound to add it to the article. Or at least mention it here. --Ed Poor Talk 07:27, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
Reading up: given that evolution plays such a central part in modern biology
What part does evolution play in modern biology? In your answer, please be sure to give an example of a biologist invoking the theory of evolution in his work because leaving it out wouldn't make sense. Don't forget to show what percent of biology papers (in peer reviewed journals) refer to evolution.
In case you can't answer this - and I was pretty sure you couldn't when I posed it - it means that biologists might give lip service to evolution, or keep silent about the claim that "nothing makes sense without it". But in fact, everything but the question of how forms of life originated makes perfect sense without any mention of evolution, positive or negative.
In case I'm wrong, I'll check back later to see if you have bothered to reply. --Ed Poor Talk 07:15, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- Apologies if I have offended or transgressed. Please don't treat me like a child and set me "homework". I am only trying to help, and I was trying to say that the article looks pretty thin in terms of content - but I don't think it's up to me to add to it, because I think the underlying premise is flawed, and if it were up to me I'd simply delete it. In answer to your other point, yes, evolutionary processes are indeed a core part of much of modern biology. I'll give just a couple of examples, with sample reasonably accessible references, one from the field and one from the lab: (1) Research on predator-prey relationships assumes a parallel set of evolutionary driving forces, acting on predator and prey, and without a basic understanding of how the changes occur from generation to generation it makes no sense (e.g. Reznick DN, Ghalambor CK, Crooks K. Experimental studies of evolution in guppies: a model for understanding the evolutionary consequences of predator removal in natural communities. Mol Ecol. 2008 Jan;17(1):97-107. Epub 2008 Aug 23. [PMID 17725576]). (2) Research on bacteriophages demonstrates evolution in action, and in fact most of what is currently going on in this field is concerned with evolutionary changes (e.g. Kropinski AM. Phage Therapy - Everything Old is New Again. Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol. 2006 Sep;17(5):297-306. [PMID 18382643]). Good enough, or would you like more examples? They are endless. Humblpi 08:08, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- In the right ball park, but so far you're striking out. Neither example addresses my concern.
- Taking the second example first, AFAIK there are no disagreements between pro- and anti-evolution biologists about bacteria mutating. If you don't know about this area of science, perhaps I should ask Philip, but I haven't heard of a single "Christian biologist" saying that mutations never occur. The 4-winged fruit fly is fairly well known, even among us laymen.
- The first example is unclear. Granted that they assume evolutionary driving forces, how does this affect their analysis? What does it have to do with anything they've observed? (Surely you're not saying that leopards and gazelles have evolved during the lifetime of the ethologists observing them.) --Ed Poor Talk 08:28, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- I have just seen your addition to Ecology: "Here at Conservapedia, we use "evolution" only to mean the emergence of a new species." Ah, well now... If you are using that incorrect definition, then I think we'll just have to agree to disagree. End of discussion. Humblpi 08:34, 10 April 2008 (EDT)
- I agree that the definition in Ecology is incorrect, but not that incorrect. See Definition of evolution for more. Otherwise, I agree with Ed Poor's comments above. Philip J. Rayment 09:25, 10 April 2008 (EDT)

Chip writes:
I fly twice a week for business exclusively on Southwest Airlines. In the last year I have probably flown 50-60 times on Southwest. I am about as loyal a Southwest customer as could be expected.
So imagine my surprise last Monday when I went to board my 12:40pm flight from Las Vegas (where I live) to Omaha and was prevented from doing so an unruly the gate agent who thought just by looking at me, she could determine whether I was too big to fit in one seat and informed me that I needed to buy a 2nd ticket.
Now I am a big guy (6’1, a few extra pounds) but I’ve never been stopped, asked, suggested, or otherwise looked-at-funny that I should buy 2 seats, by Southwest or any other airline… so I initially shrugged it off as an honest mistake. But she wouldn’t budge! Nor would two of the supervisors who were called. They dug their heels in and I stood there arguing with them as my flight boarded and left without me. This was a business trip, so I ended up losing a day of work.
The worst part of the whole experience, when I told them I fly twice a week they didn’t believe me! I tried to get no less than four(4) Southwest staff to pull up my travel history, both to show them that I was a frequent traveler and my weight wasn’t an issue, and to show them I’m a LOYAL customer, but they wouldn’t do it. I was stunned at the lack of customer service.
The proverbial cherry on top of the whole ordeal was a backhanded apology by the final supervisor who said “he was sorry that I was never stopped before.” Now I was irate.
Defeated, I went home to reschedule my flight for the next day. I looked up their rules for ejecting “persons of size” and it turns out the true test for determining if someone is too big for one seat is the put them in the seat and see if the armrests go all the way down. These people didn’t even do that. They are clearly not allowed to just visually determine if someone is too big or not, that’s discrimination! Mind you, I didn’t get anywhere near the plane, this all happened at the top of the jetway where the tickets are collected.
It’s been one week and although I’ve sent this to Southwest executives, Southwest customer service, and Southwest’s twitter account, I have yet to receive any official response or apology from them other than the appalled customer service rep who’s job it is to constantly apologize to people like me. Would this be a good time to mention that their customer service line is constantly busy and the only time to get through to them is 7am in the morning?
I’m not looking for any free stuff, all I want are the two Southwest employees who denied me my flight (one gate agent, one supervisor) to be educated on what their policies actually are so this won’t happen again. As I said, I fly twice a week and I don’t want to be ejected again.
Thanks Consumerist. Keep fighting the good fight!
Chip also provided a blog entry where he details his communication with Southwest. A customer service rep has indeed apologized over the phone, but could not guarantee that Chip wouldn’t be randomly yanked from a flight in the future.
Here’s what he would like from the airline:
1. An official written apology/letter from Southwest management that I can carry with me so as to prevent this from happening again.
2. An acknowledgment that the gate agent and supervisor acted in the wrong.
3. That gate agent and supervisor are reprimanded or otherwise informed that they acted in the wrong, directed to the actual guidelines for “customers of size” so they will not arbitrarily yank someone off a flight again.
That’s all, no money, no free stuff, no lawsuit, no 6 o’clock news. Just an apology and some effort put into making sure this is not a repeat occurrence.
The policy as written is pretty clear, and Chip just wants it to be followed. That doesn’t sound like too much to ask from a guy who flies twice a week. What do you think?
Chip says his rebooked (single ticket) flight to Omaha progressed without incident.

The ruling seems idiotic. Our justice system at its finest.
Could be. Or it could be the law that’s idiotic and should be changed. Sales taxes are outdated in a service economy: goods and services should be taxed equally.
That’s fine: The law can be changed.
Neither the spirit *NOR* the letter of the law supports this ruling.
Really? Have you read Ohio’s sales tax laws?
Cable companies have to pay a licenses fee of some sort to the state. Satellite companies don’t. The sales tax was the state’s attempt to get a similar revenue stream from the satellite companies. It’s a bit convoluted, but the intent was to level the playing field, not destabilize it.
Me thinks some Ohio supreme court justices have cable, free cable.
My first thought as well.
Do the Courts have lobbyists? This seems like a payoff.
The decision notes that both the satellite companies and the cable companies had lobbyists in the legislature which wrote the law. Apparently, the cable companies had better lobbyists.
“As a result, the cable and satellite television industries retained lobbyists to protect their interests, and ultimately the legislature amended the bill to enact a sales tax on â€œsatellite broadcasting serviceâ€ alone.”
My exact thoughts.
By “better lobbyists” you mean ones with more money, right?
Most people would think Supreme Court justices are somehow above reproach and not subject to corruption. But as a resident of Corrupticut (er, Connecticut), which over the last 10 years has seen corrupt state treasurers, mayors, legislators, and even governors and their chiefs of staff all allocute to illegal activities, I do not for one moment believe that Justices cannot be bought. They can be. Without doubt. And this case does stink of bribery.
Let’s see… cable companies have infrastructure that makes use of public space and satellite companies have no ground presence in Ohio other than the dishes on each individual home.
I’m leaning towards thinking that those judges were bribed in some fashion.
I would ask what the rationale for the difference is; if the cable companies are not taxed because they are required to upgrade and maintain the publicly owned infrastructure, then it seems like a wash.
Cable subscribers already pay separate taxes on that service.
Licence fees, but yes. There are similar charges on the cable companies, they just aren’t termed taxes. This was intended to level out the industry a bit.
IANAL but what I got from TFA is that satellite companies do not operate as local businesses, so much as they operate as large corporations. Cable companies exploit some sort of loophole where they run as “local franchises” instead of large corporations. I guess “local businesses” are exempt from whatever tax this is.
I’m from Ohio and can vouch for the fact that all cable companies around here are “local” (ex: “NEOTWC” is “North East Ohio Time Warner Cable”… instead of just “Time Warner, Inc.”)… either way the ruling still seems unfair.
Not sure about Ohio, but I know in New York, Time Warner has been reincorporating, with “Ma Warner” absorbing the local branches back into the corporation, while they keep their local names to keep from confusing customers.
It sounds like from the information that I read on the case the initial briefs were not complete and basically a technicality did the satellite groups in. I think most of the telcom/cable rules need a major overhaul so there is fairness in taxation and pricining but I guess I can keep hoping.
The decision is not idiotic at all. The Ohio legislature decided to charge sales tax on satellite services, not cable services . The Court merely said that doing so is not unconstitutional. It’s not the Courts’ job to make the laws, but to interpret them.
The decision is available here:
Good point.
It’s amazing how completely and utterly irrelevant that statement is here.
I suppose the state can tax anything they darn well please. I mean the constitution doesn’t explicitly mention not being able to tax. They could tax our air and use the excuse that the money will be used to ensure plenty of clean air for the future. They already tax your water and its distribution, so why not tax the sales of entertainment? I believe the reason this went to court is because the industry being taxed doesn’t like it and is using the “fairness” argument against it. I think taxes are not fair at all, but this is not the subject.
Of course, businesses are not taxable entities: they don’t exist (they are only abstract ideas of people). Only people are taxed. When a “business” is taxed, it merely passes the overhead to the consumer (ie people).
Cable companies are pushing hard for these taxes, just as they pushed HOAs and local governments to ban satellitie dises a few years ago. (NOTE: The FCC now prohibits such restrictions on dishes under 1 meter and any terrestial (OTA) TV antennas:)
I have to agree with the chief Justices dissent. And worse yet, this decision sets a precident that others states can, and will, follow.
It’s all about the money. Even the courts are now in it for the money.
“We’ve taxed every ting we can think of. There’s only one thing left to tax.”
“You don’t mean…?”
“Yes. We’ll have to tax… You know, “THINGY”…”
“Tax Thingy??”
“YES. Of course, we’ll exempt ourselves…”
Sorry for the typos. I must have fat fingers today.
Your fingers are too fat. To obtain a special dialing wand, mash the keyboard with you palm, now.

One more reason why lobbying should be outlawed. Along with political parties. If you did those two things, people in positions of power might actually start doing the right thing…
Term Limits.
For all.
Even judges.
The founding fathers never intended for people to make a career in elected office.
Term limits for judges combined with an abolishment of judicial elections.
(I know some people think appointed judges seem undemocratic, but I don’t think judges should be beholden to campaign donors/supporters. Judges should be fair and impartial, and not have to campaign on their “record” either. Combine with strict term limits and I think appointed judges are a great idea.)
I wish we could stop framing the tax argument as it’s OK to tax denizens as long as the tax is “fair”. Put another way, it’s OK to cable/satellite as long as they are treated equally. How about local governments provide some kind of value and make revenue off of that. They do this in some places by providing water/sewer and even electricity. OK, so why not provide cable service? It seems that people are addicted to entertainment and have this entitlement attitude towards it. Therefore, wouldn’t it be in the public’s interest to have the town provide said service? I’ll go further and argue that towns could make money providing cable, internet and telephone. There! The technology is mature, there are plenty of local people capable of installing the infrastructure; there is no reason this wouldn’t work… except one: the cable industry would fight this idea make sure it never saw the light of day. But other than that!
Because then the cable/satellite/internet companies sue the town for unfair competition
Some actually Do. Kutztown, PA has thier own cable tv/internet service. It operates at small profit (money back to the borough) and costs about 20% LESS. It’s now, however, virtually impossible to start in a new town. You can thank verizon and comcast for the all the new regulations, laws, and fees if it’s attempted.
Cable providers pay a franchisee fee based upon projected sales/use/customers in most Cities/States. Basically the consumer is already paying a tax (built into the price).
Satellite providers don’t pay the franchisee fee, thus sales tax is applicable.
Yes, State tax laws are totally farked up.
If I build a product or service that is cheaper / better/ or avoids built in pitfalls of another competing business model, then the government should step in and tax my more efficient business to level the playing field, right?
I don’t care. DishNetwork is still 1000x better than Time Warner. (Yes, I live in Ohio.)
The truth is cable company’s have to pay franchise fees to every city they serve (sat does not pay these fees) also there are tariffs charged to the cable companies that sat does not pay either so in the end cable pays more taxes and fees in Ohio than the sales tax the sat companys pay. See or

Which new vehicles offer the most value? That's an interesting question, and one that insurer USAA set out to answer.
In particular, USAA looked at the leading vehicle in every category. The evaluation ended up with a Sweet 16. Models being tagged as "Best Value" take into account cost, safety and reliability, among other key factors.
There are nearly 80 cars, trucks and minivans that are currently designated as USAA Preferred vehicles, and the Best Value list represents the vehicles that rose to the top of each category, USAA says.
"The goal of the list is to help members identify vehicles that offer better safety ratings, lower insurance costs, higher fuel economy, better overall reliability and lower (price tag) compared to other vehicles in the same category," said Steve Thompson, an assistant vice president with USAA.
So what's on the list? Here are the model leaders

GM recalling 944,000 vehicles
General Motors Corp. said Friday it was recalling 944,000 vehicles because of a problem with a windshield wiper fluid system that could lead to a fire.
General Motors Corp. said Friday it was recalling 944,000 vehicles because of a problem with a windshield wiper fluid system that could lead to a fire.
Four Honda models, more than any other single automaker, topped the rankings for their vehicle segments in an annual J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey of U.S. drivers released Thursday.
General Motors said Friday that it is recalling about 900,000 pickups worldwide to fix problems with tailgate cables that can corrode and break when loads are placed on them.
Attitudes about buying American cars are changing in the Midwest, once easy pickings for domestic automakers. And that could spell trouble for Detroit.
Cadillac Escalade Ext
The government has upgraded its investigation into reports that tailgates can fall off some General Motors pickups. The NHTSA on Monday said it was reviewing tailgate support cables on some models of GMC Sonomas, Chevrolet S10s, Chevrolet Silverados and GMC Sierras.
The Nissan Maxima's fancy headlights have made it such a target for thieves that Maxima's rate of insurance theft claims has gone from inconsequential to second-highest among all vehicles, according to a report due Tuesday. But, Cadillac's Escalade EXT has the worst rate of theft claims, the report says.
When Cadillac launched a redesigned Escalade sport-utility vehicle two years ago, it scored a hit with rappers, athletes and hip-hop wannabes.

136 Three Score and Ten in Retrospect care of there too, but these could be a relief from the routine stresses and strains that never let up at the office. The Indians John's interest in Indians began with his boyhood days when he found arrowheads and pieces of pottery around his home. Perhaps this is one of the things John was referring to when he made the statement that "It's difficult to tell where an activity leaves off being a hobby and becomes an avocation, or even a vocation." His interest in Indians and collecting artifacts led to a significant part of his legal career. Another result of this fascination with the Indian people is that the whole family had a rich cultural experience in getting to know this enchanting segment of the population. Quoting again from the 1951Deseret News article: Mr. Boyden usually does his loafing with a steering wheel in his hand and a road beneath that leads himself and his family to colorful comers of America, usually among the Indians, who are perhaps his most engrossing hobby, many of them his personal friends. Besides being good camera bait, they are a source of many fascinating objects of art and craftsmanship to bring back to his den. The den itself is a hobby. Visitors usually want to see it and would rather spend an evening there than return to the beautiful but more formal living room upstairs. Interest begins at the foot of the stairs, where Mr. Boyden has burned in true brand fashion, all the brands of his home valley, North Summit, along with the legend of them, and branding rules in general. His own brand is featured prominently - the Lazy JB Connected, which was handed down from his father and grandfather. (A lazy letter in a brand is simply one that lies down.) Inside, the room, although furnished with strange objects, is warm and homey. The fireplace was built of stones from the Boyden yard and garden, with insets of Indian motifs on tile,

Why do you sell service and maintenance agreements to your customers? Because they make sense. Spending a little bit of money now to take care of the little things in a heating or air conditioning unit can head off the need to spend big money later in the event of a system breakdown.
To me, it’s not that difficult to transfer the logic behind service and maintenance agreements to the climate change debate. Here’s how:
What if the climate change deniers are right? They say there’s no such thing as climate change and it’s a waste of tax dollars to address a problem that doesn’t exist. “The planet is fine! Why do we need to spend money on it?”
Hmmm . . . that sounds suspiciously like the argument you might hear from a customer who doesn’t see the value of a service and maintenance agreement. “My furnace and air conditioner are running fine! Why do I need to spend money on them?”
On the other side of the coin, what if the climate change believers are right? They say we are risking a catastrophic — and incalculably expensive — breakdown of our planet’s heating and cooling system because we didn’t see the value of taking care of it along the way.
Picture the customer who listens to your explanation of your company’s service and maintenance agreement program and says, “OK, I understand that my comfort system is complex and valuable. I think spending a little bit every year to keep it in top shape is a great idea.”
Our planet is complex and valuable, too. We should support policies and behaviors that keep it in good shape. And that’s not even taking into account all the opportunities and jobs that environmentally conscious “green” programs — and, yes, regulations — have created in our industry.
It’s true that sometimes a furnace or air conditioner might run fine for years without any service or maintenance. But is that what you’d truly recommend to customers? Would you ever tell a customer, “Don’t worry about it and hope you get lucky”? No way.
There’s too much at stake. The wise move in both service agreements and climate policy is to spend a little along the way to reduce the chance of a catastrophic breakdown later.

Yup, pinterest here too ;) Thanks for the recipe.
Going to make it tonight for my hubs for breakfast, great recipe!
Just found this through Pinterest - MUST try now!!! Love it!! :)
Hi! Do you think I could mix this up the night before and bake it in the morning? Looks delish!
Coming from Pinterest and this looks scrumptious!
Totally have to try this. Looks soooo yummy! Oh, and I, too, found you on Pinterest.
I'm one of your newest followers because of this delicous(!)looking recipe that I happened upon at Pinterest. I'm more from "the South" so I'm hoping to find some more new recipe ideas here!
Blessings,
Leslie
This is breakfast food... right? Please say yes.
Just popped over from Pinterest! Going to make this recipe tomorrow! Thanks!
In the oven now!
DELICIOUS! Made it Friday and ate it Saturday morning. It was definitely the best right out of the oven, but still SO good in the morning! AND it really was SO easy! I had everything in my cupboards already! If you haven't made this, try it!
I saw the picture of these mouthwatering cinnamon buns on Pinterest and HAD to find the recipe. So glad I found your blog :)
Found you via Pinterest and cannot wait to try this recipe out. Looks delish.
got this off of pinterest...made the cake and it is so moist and flavorfull...i cheated on the icing and i opened a can of cream cheese whipped icing and melted it in microwave so i could drizzle it on top of cake...yummo
I, too, found this on pinterest! Looks amazing and I cannot wait to try it!
So amazing. We demolish a pan in a night at my house LOL. I am tempted to try cream cheese icing myself!
Making it now. Is that right- 3 sticks of butter? yikes!! Smells great!!
Oh my goodness, this was delicious! I just made it and it was fabulous! Guess 3 sticks of butter did the trick!
Found you on Pinterest as well. Just made the cake and it is DIVINE!!! Love how the house smells. I put a link on my fb page!
Pinterest guilty as well! This looks delicious! I'm thinking about making this as my husband's birthday "cake".
Should I use regular (all-purpose) flour, cake flour, or self-rising flour?
i'd like to know too if we can mix & refrig the night before & bake in the morning. I'd like to take to a teacher's meeting on monday.
Hi!
To answer a few questions....I used all purpose flour in the cake.
I have never tried making it ahead of time and baking it the next day, so I'm just not sure if that could be done or not!
Thanks!
Oy to the vey. DELICOUS!!! Found on Pinterest, and I am in LOVE!
This was VERY YUMMY! Thanks for sharing! I posted a link to it in my blog :)
(Oh, and I found it on Pinterest)
OMGosh!!! AMAZING is all I can say. If the cake tastes anything like the batter, then I can kiss this diet goodbye! ;) It is in the oven right now...I can't wait to try it. My husband and our daughter (3 years old) fought over who got to lick what.....the beater, the spatula, or the knife. Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I too found it on Pintrest.
I made this last night and it was AMAZING...so so good!!!! THANK YOU! I love pinterest! :)
It took me like 40 minutes to cook, now I'm just waiting for it to cool, it smells so good!
I wasn't looking for a recipe for our Labor Day picnic, but I found one anyway. I clicked over from Pinterest, btw. Thanks!
I just made this today and it was absolutely AMAZING!!!!! Melts in your mouth, buttery goodness!!! Thank you so much for sharing this!! :)
saw the pic on pinterest and had to try it! it's in the oven now! thanks!
This looks so good and I will give it a try VERY soon!
That was the best cake EVER!!! Loved it! Will be making again soon, to share this time. :)
Mine is in the oven! Also came from Pinterest!
Just pinned this from Pinterest. Judging from the comments, I MUST go into my kitchen this moment and put to together!!!! Thanks for sharing it.
Saw it on Pinterest and I am sitting here with a warm piece of the cake as I type! Mmmmmmmmm! If you've just read the recipe, I advise you to go straight into your kitchen and make it.
I've pinned over a hundred things on Pinterest now, but this is the first time I've hit the kitchen immediately after pinning it. Just waiting for it to cool off a bit before we dig in.
In the oven now! It smells sooooo good...I can't wait to taste it! I had everything in my pantry - it was perfect! Via Pinterest :)
Just found this on pinterest :) Gonna make it and blog soon! Thanks...
So yummy and easy to make from basic ingredients :)
I'm another one from Pinterest...just took them out of the oven, and they smell AMAZING!! Taking them to work tomorrow for a birthday!
It's in the oven now....smells so good. Can't wait to eat it. Found you on Pinterest. :)
This Southern girl thinks your "up north" cooking, especially this recipe, sounds good!

OOOh crazy Pinterest fire! Baking this right now. I am going to try a caramel sauce instead of a glaze. I know....I am naughty!
I too, got the recipe off Pinterest. It looked too good not to make. It's in the oven now. I thought the cake batter was quite thick for cake. I wonder if I did something wrong. I'm an experienced baker, and I followed the directions to a T. I will just have to see how it turned out when it comes out of the oven. I added 1/2 tsp. of baking soda and used buttermilk instead of the milk. I always substitute buttermilk for milk and haven't had a failure yet. Maybe that's what made the batter so thick? I found it hard to swirl the topping in. Any advice from those who have made it?
Just made this! Super excited to see how it tastes!
Hi. Another "Pinterest" visitor. Sounds YUM!!
Hooray for Pinterest! I can't wait to try this!!
Hi, I too am a Pinterest visitor. This recipe looks amazing... Going to try it soon. Thanks!!
This cake looks wonderful!
I've made this same recipe before a few times, but last time I used a third of the amount of butter called for in the cinnamon topping, and liked it better. Way too much, for me at least, the way it is written.
I do not even know what Pinterest is. But the recipe looked delicious so it is in the oven, and the batter is yummy. My topping wasn't swirlable either so maybe won't be as pretty but it should still taste great, eh? Thank you for the recipe.
Thank you!! This sounds wonderful!!
Found this recipe on Pinterest too! It looks delicious! I can't wait to try it.
just tried your recipe but with wholemeal flour and it tastes great. although I would put a little less of butter and suger in the topping. its a bit too much :)but of course its very tasty ;)
Just made this and yum! I decreased the butter in the topping per the reviews and it turned out well!
Another "found you on Pinterest" Wow! Just pulled this out of the oven and ate our first piece. SOOOO good!! Made it exactly as written and my husband is over the moon. So easy too!
This looks delicious! Thanks for the recipe!
Just made this, it turned out great!! As others did, I only used 1/2 stick of butter and 1 cup brown sugar for the topping. Thanks so much!!
Found on Pinterest! Hi! Love the recipe. But i made it and it was real think batter. And it was hard to swril the knife threw. Is that how it is supposed to be? I cooked it and it took alog time and it was real dark on top . I dont know what i did maybe the Altitude? I live in Idaho.? thanks it is still good :)
I made this and I added 1/2 block of cream cheese to the glaze... and it made the glaze a treat on it's on... soooo good.
Is this best the day of or just as good a day later? Plan to make it tonight or tomorrow for a friend's birthday - she loves cinnamon rolls.
I have just taken this out of the oven. Waiting for it to cool a little. Smells heavenly. I was just introduced to Pinterest. I will certainly keep coming back.
Found this on pinterest and I'm so excited! I have been looking for a cinnamon roll cake recipe b/c last Christmas a doctor friend of ours had a patient that made him one and he shared it with us! Holy cow, my husband and I couldn't get enough, we were hooked! So I have been trying to find one and as soon as I came across the picture I was totally freakin out! ;) I'm going to make it tomorrow!! Thanks for sharing!!
Found you on pinterest too. My dad has been a pinterest hater until today. He tried this recipe(which he found on pinterest) and we all LOVE it, including him!!! Thanks for bringing him over into the "dark side" of pinterest!
It is dangerous that I have everything in the house to make this RIGHT NOW!! :)
This is baking in the oven sa I type! I also saw the pic on Pinterest and knew I had to bake it as a pre-church surprise one Sunday morning!
Gotta love Pinterest!
Hello! This looks awesome!
I am typing this with one hand because my other hand is busy shoveling forkfuls of this into my mouth. Now, to find a smaller pan to transfer it into before my husband comes home... :)
Also - I added a quarter cup of chopped pecans to the topping. I thought I could count out some of the carbs by adding some protein. ;)
I tried this tonight and added a cup of packed pumpkin to the mix and it adds a great spin on this delectable cake!!
Mine is in the oven now!! I have already tested the batter and 'cinnamon swirl' it is AMAZING!! So the cake together should be astounding!!
Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I made this for a carry in for bosses day and everyone loved it so much that I almost didn't get a piece myself! So yummy, my family is now begging for me to make it again for them to eat!
this was so D-LISH, i'm so glad i got to taste it. I have a family of 3... my husband and daughter couldnt even wait for the glaze. They drizzeled the glaze after they served themselve. thank you for sharing
=)
This was so d-lish!!! i cant wait to make it again =) thank you for sharing.
This is soooo good. Found you through pinterest and made it for my husband instead of a regular birthday cake. It is quite the hit! Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe.
This looks delicious! Keep up the good work!
This looks amazing! I'm sure my boys will love these! yum!
This is awesome...I used a white cake mix then proceeded with the other two steps. Thank you.
I tried this today and it was delicious! The only thing is...when I put the topping on the cake mixture, I did it in dollops and then swirled it with the knife. Is this the way you recommend to do it?
can't wait to make this recipe. I am really loving pinterest. Glad to have found you!
Just saw you on Pinterest, gonna switch it to gluten free and enjoy!!
Just saw this on Pinterest too, and am now going to make this for my mother in law's bday dinner for tonight! Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I'm sure it will be a hit! :)
tried it and LOVED it!!!
Pure Yumminess. I followed it to a T.
thanks!
I just made these! They were amazing. Thanks for the recipe!! :)
Sounds great! And way quicker than making cinnamon rolls.
Heaven in a 9x13 pan! This is SO yummy! And since it is a "cinnamon roll" cake...can I eat it for breakfast?
This looks like one amazing cake! I'm off to try it now!
Made it gluten free and it was amazing! Oh, and no one noticed it was gluten free!
In the oven now. It is taking a little longer to bake than it called for but the only problem with that is a house full of hungry boys waiting to dig in! It was very easy to make and sells delicious!
I found this pan on sinful deliciousness on pinterest! I just made this and it left me and my family speechless! I am amazed that something as quick and easy to make is SO amazing! Thank you so much for sharing! This is so totally going to blow my diet! Heck, I am new to pinterest and everything that I have made is wonderful! My new addiction!
Made this cake yesterday and it's gone, gone, gone! It was delicious and fills the cinnamon roll craving without all the fuss! Thank you for putting this on Pinterest.
Just pulled this out of the oven...o...m...g...that is unreal. :) took about a half hour here and i only had margarine and that was fine too!!! Delicious and will be made again!!!
Found you as well on Pinterest...Had to make it the very next day and Oh my goodness it was so moist, rich and tasted just like a cinnamon bun. Even my son who doesn't usually like cake loved it!!! Thank you!
MMM this looks amazing. Will try it soon for sure.
Got this off of pinterest as well....mine didn't turn out at all :(
Yep...another pinterest stalker! My attempt is baking away right this minute! My husband used the last of our milk for cereal before I could make the glaze! TYPICAL MAN! So I'm having to use sour cream, fingers crossed!
made this today...so decadent!
made this today...so decadent!!
I will be making this! Thank you!
Terrific recipe. My friend shared this with me, and I got a call we were having unexpected company dropping in. Whipped this up and served it warm out of the oven. Believe me, it was a hit. Will definitely be making this often in the future. Nice quick, easy-to-follow recipe. My husband likes it warmed up with apple sauce drizzled over it!!
I'm making this today for company...I also found you on Pinterest, and I've wanted to try it for a while. Thanks!
I just made it. I baked it for the 30 mins it called for but the inside was still undercooked. Is it supposed to be gooey? I gave my boys a piece and put it back in the oven for a few more minutes. It does taste yummy. I am thinking of letting the boys have a piece for breakfast with milk and some fruit.
Amazing cake. I used less butter and icing sugar, but turned out divine! Thank you very much for my new favourite cake!
I am planning on making this cake next week, and I was wondering if anyone tried the "mix the ingredients the night before" method and bake the next day, and what the end result was?!
I made this cake for a women's Bible study this week, and it is fabulous! I know it's going to be a family favorite for years to come.
I made this a few days ago, and it is fabulous, a new family favorite for sure!
Pinned this on Pinterest a few weeks ago and just had time to make it, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! (added bonus the house smells amazing too!!)
In the oven right now. I should be doing homework. Should be ready in 5 minutes, I'm super duper excited. Found it on pinterest, btw.
It's in the oven right now. I came over here to see if anyone else still had a completely gooey middle after the recommended baking time? I wish I had thought to read the comments before I started - - I definitely would have cut back on the butter!
Another pinner here! Going to make this today for the family, looks delicious!
This looks SO amazing! Cinnamon rolls are my favorite, I can't wait to try!
i have made this recipe twice over the weekend. AWESOME! For the glaze i added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese and loved it.
i tried this recipe in a electric oven for the 28 minutes and turned out perfect. i then made it again a couple days later and baked it in my sisters oven (which is gas) and it was gooey in thr middle so i'm not sure if the gas stove has anything to do with the peoples that turned out gooey or not.
I had a really gooey center as well, but the edges were really brown. Did anyone else use a non-stick pan? I can't figure out what I did wrong
Have you ever mixed it up the night before (except the glaze) and refrigerated over-night? Then baked the next day? I love doing things like this for family holidays - if I can do most of the "work" the day/night before! Thanks!
Pintrist rules! I made this tonight for the whole family; everyone's visiting for Thanksgiving. What a hit! I had to cook it a bit longer though, about 45 minutes. But it was well worth the wait... plus the house smelled delicious! Thanks
Hi! I'll try to answer a few questions.
I have never tried making this ahead of time and baking it the next day...sorry! I'm not sure what would happen.
And I have no idea why some people are getting a gooey center. Sorry!
I think if you use the toothpick test it should work to tell if it is done or not. Everyones ovens and pans are different. Your oven may take longer than 30 minutes.
It is also important to stir in the melted butter SLOWLY, mixing well. Maybe cooling the butter slightly before mixing it in may help also.
Another thing to try would be to bake it in 2 smaller pans...maybe it would bake more evenly.
As for the amount of butter....hey I'm a Paula Deen fan...I can't get enough butter...and always look for rich recipes to make!!!!!
Thanks!
I'm a Pinaholic and just found this! I am going to try these on Thanksgiving morning. I usually make my own cinnamon rolls, but these look much easier! If they are as good as everyone says, I may be featuring them on my own blog for Christmas morning! (With your permission, of course!) Thanks for sharing! Monica@tiztheseason.wordpress.com
Looks so good! Can't wait to make it! :D
Found on pinterest, gonna make tomorrow for Thanksgiving!
Mine are in the oven as we speak. My 10 y/o helped to make it and is so excited to try it!! Love Pinterest!!! Thanks for sharing!!
This looks amazing! Will try it soon and will make it again for Christmas morning.
Got this from Pinterest. thanks!
This was delicious !!!!
Making it for the second time today! DELICIOUS!!!!
I pinned your cinnamon roll cake recipe...I made it!
We LOVE -LOVE -LOVED it!
1-5 stars we give it a 6! Thank you for a delicious breakfast that will be added to the family favorites!
Made this last night and it is deliscious :)
I halved the recipe and used gluten free AP flour and powdered egg replacer. Turned out wonderful! I was scared because at the end of cooking time it still looked like liquid, but after cooling it firmed up. Delicious! The BEST GF, DF, EF recipe for a "cinnamon roll" EVER!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you...and my 9 yr old son with multiple allergies thanks you.
Found this today on Pinterest! It was as fantastic as it sounded :) Thank you!!
This looks AMAZING! Such a great idea :D This is actually in my oven as I type this...Thank you!!
Ok...dumb question....plain or self rising flour?
This looks A.M.A.Z.I.N.G....oh, and mine just came out of the oven!!!
( Its even better tasting then it looks!! (possible??) )
Making it as we speak!! :)
This looked so good had to run out to the kitchen and make it. It is in teh oven right now....wanted something sweet and this certainly fits teh bill. Found on Pinterest!
My husband is a man of very little comment and even he said "Oh, that really looks good. You better make that."!! I'm making it this week for a family Christmas gathering this Saturday! Can't wait to try it. I might have to make two...one to eat here at home and one for the gathering! :o) Thank you for the recipe!!
I made this yesterday morning!!!I added chocolate chips... It was delicious!!!
I brought this to work this morning and it was a HUGE hit! I have an insulated carrier with hot packs in it, so still warm even after my 45 min commute! I'm my co-workers new best friend! I did everything last night except mix it up with the butters & liquid. Had all my dry ingredients ready in a mixing bowl, the topping mix ready, pan greased, etc. Made it easier for someone who is not a "morning person" by nature. Love it! This will be our Christmas morning meal. Along with candy from the Stockings! Calories don't count on Christmas morning!
Made this last night. Wife took it to work this morning for a focus group - they couldn't focus. So good.
My dream of hosting my own cooking show is becoming a reality today!! I'm a librarian at a high school in Oklahoma and the Foods Teacher has asked me to prepare something for her class. In searching for yummy recipes, I came across yours! Thank you for posting pictures. The kids are going to LOOOOVE this!!! Angel from Oklahoma
I was so exited to see this! My son loves cinnamon rolls, but usually isn't too crazy about cake. We haven't had too much luck with candles in the rolls. Glad I found this as his birthday is in 2 weeks!
Cinnamon Rolls are something we eat nearly every weekend for breakfast or snack. This recipe sounds so delicious I'm making it for us tonight for dessert. Maybe some will survive until breakfast....lol. I can hardly wait to taste it because the picture looks divine. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
Hi! Found via Pinterest, too.
One question....when I put the topping it goes down in the batter....is it correct? The cake is in teh oven right now but I'm afraid it wasn't done properly...maybe I will try again tomorrow...any suggestion greately appreciated ;-)
Um, hello? Where have you been all my life? This was AmAzInG! Thank you, Laurie, and thank you Pinterest.
found you on Pinterest and looks amazing!! Gonna try it!
Made this tonight for a Christmas party and it was such a huge hit!! I do believe next time I will reduce the butter in the topping. It seemed to make the bottom of the cake very greasy. But otherwise it came out perfect. I cooked it for 35 mins which was spot on. Thanks for the recipe!
Based on these comments, I must get up and go to the kitchen to make this cake!!
Also from Pinterest! So excited to try this, it looks AH-MAZE-ING! :)
loved this cake! THANK YOU! also found via pinterest. i halved the butter in the cake and in the streusel, and it turned out just fine.
next time, i'd add chopped nuts to the streusel, and more cinnamon. YUM!
it was so very delicious - thank you!
Just made it- and it is all its cracked up to be- great recipe! Thank you!
Made these this morning but turned them into muffins instead of 9x13 pan. They cooked in about 25 min. and I put approx. 1 heaping TBL of struesel in each muffin. I then topped them with the glaze and they're incredible! 24 muffins.
This sounds like perfect Christmas breakfast along with our traditional egg nog.
these look insanely wonderful! now following you and can't wait to continue reading your recipe posts! Happy Holidays!
Incredible! Changed it around a bit but was still delicious
Also found this one on Pinterest (but didn't we all?) and decided to make it today. It's in the oven right now, and after reading the comments, I am wayy too excited.
I loved this recipe but felt like there was way too much baking powder. Anyone else? How much could I cut out without ruining the cake?
I saw this on Pinterest, but I'm bookmarking it...so I can make it someday.Hope you still have it by the time I make it!
Just found this via Pinterest! SO excited to try this! :)
Making this for breakfast on Christmas morning - found you on Pinterest and added your blog to my Google Reader.
I can't wait to make this for Christmas morning! It looks heavenly!!!
Just made this for Christmas morning and can't wait to dive into it!
Wow....no one had dessert planned for Christmas dinner. I have everything in the pantry for this delicious looking cake and I know everyone will LOVE it!
last night my kids pointed out to me that I didn't buy our traditional cinn rolls to have for Christmas breakfast. I printed out this recipe (had wanted to try it). I mixed everything for the cake, except for the butter, put it in the fridge. I then mixed up the cinn. mixture, except for the butter, covered and left it on the counter. I then measured out the powdered sugar and sat it aside. This a.m. when I got up I stirred the batter, added the butter and poured into pan. I then added the butter to the cinn. mix. and added it to the batter. It did take about 40 min. for it to get done. I then added the rest to the glaze. It came out so good and I was glad I did most of the work last night. We just spooned on the glaze as we ate it (my dad prefers it w/o glaze). I will make this for sure to take to school one day.
Like most everyone else, I found the recipe on Pinterest. We made it to go along with our xmas morning stuff, and it was a HUGE hit. My mother in law requested the recipe, hahaha. Thanks for posting it! It's made the list for next year's xmas morning feast.
I just made this recipe, it is in the oven right now. It was super easy to make literally mixed it up in less than 10 minutes. I am interested to see how it tastes :) Smells delish!
I made this cake for a Christmas party with ladies from my church. I'm known for making good stuff and I ran out of time and ingredients for some of my usual recipes. I decided to check out Pinterest and saw the cake and decided I just had to do it. I wasn't disappointed and neither were any of the ladies! They all loved it and I shared the recipe. Thank you for some new yumminess!
Found this on Pinterest and wanted to try it but I have one small question first. I assume with adding the baking powder the flour would be all-purpose? I know this can be a big deal and just wanted to double check. Thanks :)
Yes...the flour is all purpose. Hope you enjoy!
I made this on Christmas Eve for us to enjoy on Christmas morning while we unwrapped our presents. It was so easy I thought I missed a step. It was also very very delicious. I will be making it again tonight to bring in to the office tomorrow for my co workers to enjoy. Thanks for the recipe!
Made this last night and it was soooo good!!! thank god for pinterest!!
Well, of course I found this on Pinterest and made it for 2 different Christmas gatherings. It was a hit at both....
I baked both at the same time; one in a metal pan and one in glass dish (both 9x13). The one in the metal pan was done in less time than required; the glass dish took approximately 40 minutes. Honestly, the glass dish cake was 'prettier' on top and more moist but both were excellent. In fact, I finished off the last piece from the metal pan this morning and it was STILL moist :) Two thumbs up.
Amazingly good. I actually didn't really want a 9x13 pan of this so I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 25 minutes. Came out perfectly! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
I made this for Christmas morning. It was wonderful! However, I found that my topping ended up at the bottom of the pan. Was I supposed to turn it out onto a platter before icing it? It was gooey and stuck to the bottom of the pan. I think that I will try turning it out next time. DELICIOUS though.
I have made this twice this week it is so good!!!
I've never found a recipe that I had to try right away until now. This is in the oven as I type. It's my reward for surviving oral surgery this week. Looks soft enough to eat without too much trouble.
I love cinnamon rolls and have since I was a kid, but they are too time consuming to make. This recipe looked delicious and simple enough to try. I just made it and OH MY GOODNESS! It's more delicious than any cinnamon roll I've ever had. Me and three kids ate half of it. Thank you for sharing!
Happy New Year to ME! LOVE this. My 10 year old son made it for treats tonight...even my food snob husband LOVED it...Thanks. (oh yeah, found it on Pinterest...now my hubby can't complain about the time I spend searching on it.)
I made these for a brunch on New Years day and everyone loved them. I took the rest to my daughter and she called after I left and said she ate one piece and before she knew it had eaten half of another. lol...Needless to say I will be making these again and again!
Looks AMAZING...trying to get the ingredients together (away from home) because I MUST try!
Cut the recipe in half and baked in a 9x9" pan. Can't wait to try it!!
Looks wonerful and easy for Sunday morning
Another new finder from Pinterest!
I just made this tonight after I saw it on Pinterest. It. Is. AMAZING! My boyfriend almost flipped. We ate some for dessert tonight--heated in the microwave with a scoop of Butter Pecan ice cream on top! Out of this world!
Saw on Pinterest and cannot wait to try!
Re-pinned this recipe to my pinterest site and I am now waiting for this scrumptious dessert to get out of the oven! Can't wait! Thanks so much!
I repinned this to my Pinterest page and am now waiting for this scrumptious dessert to get out of the oven. Can't wait to try it! Thanks so much!
My 1.5 yr old daughter & I had a messy good time making this wonderful treat!!!
Found on Pintrest!
Baking it now!
I will be posting this on our family recipe blog if thats ok (credits to you :)
Mmmm! Cant wait to eat it!!
Found this on Pinterest and made it this morning! It was AHmazing!!! I do thing I will try it with some buttercream or cream cheese icing next time!!! Thanks
I found this on Pinterest and am hoping to try this tomorrow.
Another pinterest find...I made this tonight and it is SO good! Thanks for sharing. :)
Lots of people asked...Can this recipe be made overnight and baked in the AM? I made the recipe yesterday afternoon, stuck it in the 'frige, and woke up this AM and baked it. I had to bake for 45 minutes. I even had the glaze made beforehand as well and had it chillin' in a separate bowl with the cake. It makes your whole house smell WONDERFUL as it bakes!! My hubby requested more glaze on it, so I'm gonna do a double batch of glaze next time I make this recipe. Hope that helps ya'll.
made this today, yummy. also from pintrest. I do wish I had read the reviews b/c I agree 100% cut the topping either in half or less butter in it, it was too 'runny' once cooking/melting and left big spots in the cake once all that butter was melted. Also, not swirlable. Still very Yummy, not pretty though.
Just found this today on Pinterest and making it now! Can't wait to eat it. I love all things cinnamon and I know this will be one of my new favorites!
I found this on pinterest and decided to make it for dessert, I must say this is fabulous! And so easy to make! Thank you!

IST Project Fact Sheet
Paradigm Unifying System Specification Environments for proven Electronic design (PUSSEE)
Funded under 5th FWP (Fifth Framework Programme)
Action Line: 2000-4.7.2 Subsystems
Project URL:/SLIF standard). The link of B with C, VHDL and System C, an IP encryptor for secure data transmission through internet and a network management module for automobiles.
Work description:
To satisfy a need for products of high reliability with short time-to-market, PUSSEE introduces two key aspects, reusability and formal proof of system properties.
Reusability, although popular in the software world, is not yet usual in the domain of embedded systems because few design methods can integrate reusable sub-systems. The PUSSEE approach allows the reuse of existing components at various levels of the design. UML system specifications provide reusable system models through concepts like inheritance. Then virtual components, as defined in VSI Alliance, address reusability during later development stages.
The second important innovation introduced by PUSSEE, is the use of the B language for proving the properties of embedded system on chips (SoC). The formality of B complements the lack of formal semantics, which is the major drawback of UML. The two languages, jointly used to develop complex systems formally proven from the earliest design stage, allow to discover mistakes, inconsistencies or inefficiencies early enough to be fixed at minimum cost. Moreover, the reusability of B abstract machines at any level of refinement, with preservation of the integrity of the proven system specification, introduces a breakthrough in the reusability practice and paves the way to interface based design "a la" VSIA/SLIF. A set of tools enabling a seamless use of the two languages will support the approach.
PUSSEE goals can be summarized as follows:
- Interface base design allowing sub-systems composition;
- Definition of a synergy between UML and B
- Tool support throughout all stages of the system specifications refinement;
- Elaboration of reusable components for both system specification (reusable UML and B models) and system development (reusable virtual components).
The selected applications from the automotive and telecommunication domains will materialize the expectations of the participating system companies whose role is:
- Transferring the know-how and current trends from two highly demanding design domains;
- Learning the use of formal languages required for proven and reliable system development;
- Contributing to integrate in the PUSSEE methodology their actual needs very accurately;
- Assessing the applicability of this methodology through real industry cases.
The PUSSEE research activities will be guided and constrained by their actual needs.
Milestones:
- A tool linking Rational Rose to Atelier-B by providing translations between UML diagrams and B;
- A prototype tool that translates B to system-C and VHDL;
- A study of how the B method can be complemented to better support specification, refinement and code generation of systems with real-time properties;
- A method with tool support for interface based design (VSIA/SLIF) and integration of legacy components;
- User guidelines and methodology assessment reports from industrial use cases.
Results will be commercialised and disseminated through conferences, courses and web pages.
- Record Control Number: 61051

Managing people can be your key to long-term growth.
I was traveling down the highway last month with my partner, Terry Jones, when he mentioned, "The greatest hindrance to growing my operation is getting and keeping good hired help." That's common and I hear it often.
We were returning from a northeastern Missouri road trip and stopped and talked to a lender I hadn't seen for awhile. I asked him what's the greatest challenge his producers face and he said, "people-management issues."
I've always had an interest in this area since I managed a large staff when I was with Farm Credit Services. We now help our clients in this area.
Having the right people in the right place at the right time with the right set of skills - and doing the right things - makes your job easy and fun. How do you do that?
The first thing I ask clients is, "Do your employees have answers to five basic questions?" I call it the management wheel (right).
The first question is at the center: "Why are we here?" That's what the management gurus call a mission. If your mission is to be the best soybean producer in the state, then your employees need to know it. That allows them to work for a bigger cause than just a job. Coincidentally, this is also the first step in developing a business plan. Many state soybean associations have training programs on developing a business plan.
The next question is, "Where are we going?" Most employees don't know the goals of the farming operation. The goals can be simple, but need to be specific and written. I saw one on a blackboard in a machine shed that said, "To beat last year's yield we need better stands and less weed pressure. And we're going to have harvest done by Oct 23."
Everybody knew what was expected. And do you know what? It happened. Remember the power of having written goals that I wrote about in the February issue a year ago?
The next question, "How am I doing?" is generally the biggest area where we all fall down. Most people don't know how they're doing until something goes wrong - and you know what happens then. It's no different with big corporations. The way to solve this is to post your progress.
One of our clients has written scouting reports of every field so everybody knows the status. People want to do a good job and will if they know the rules of the game and how the score is kept.
"What's in it for me?" is a natural question everyone has. Plus, paying bonuses is easier when everyone knows the rules and the score, and if the game gets won.
Last but not least is, "What happens when I need help?" If you answer the first four, your employees feel comfortable in coming to you with problems when there are yellow flags and before they become red flags. Another neat thing happens when everyone has answers to these questions - they start thinking like an owner.
One final point. These management tools work with family members and other owners, too. That's where I would start. The key to long-term sustainable growth for farming operations will be human capital, not financial or physical capital. Henry Ford understood this a century ago and it still applies.
<|endofexample|>
Even though specialty grains offer a price premium, those premiums are usually not enough for smaller producers — 500-600 acres or fewer — to make farming a full-time job. But organic grains, a form of specialty crop, might do the trick, says Purdue University ag economist Corinne Alexander.
“Experts are forecasting growth rates for organic products at 10-20% annually over the medium term,” Alexander points out. “One of the fastest growing markets is feed grains for organic dairies, meat and poultry producers.”
Alexander says Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania accounted for 40% of the organic milk production in recent years and substantial flocks of organic layer hens, broilers and turkeys. There also are organic layer hens in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. Organic grain growers in those states and nearby states have market potential, Alexander says.
Check with your state Extension Service or state Department of Agriculture for information on organic grain buyers or organic grower groups in your area.

Shhhhh....
don't tell Stanley that I
bought the rabbits some treats!
Pumpkin Chews!
Especially for small pets like rabbits.
Stanley is a bit of a 'spoil sport'
when it comes to feeding wild animals
like rabbits and gophers...
Oopsie doopsie!
Ummm... What? Huh? Hmmm...
Love you Stanley... :)

Oops, busted!!! Hope the rabbits enjoy their treats :-)
your handsome hubby has a wonderful smile. Just remember Men are from Mars and we are from Venus. i bet on Venus the women feed pumpkin chews to rabbits. LOL
Haha .Just say you want to loose some weight ,so they are yours
xxx Elisabeth
Lucky rabbit!!!
I just showed my husband your beautiful blog. The bunnies are so cute and we love the photos of the yellow birds.
Hehehe, the rabbits will have a banquet in your garden.
I'm glad to know you bought them the treats. :)
I hope Stanley will join them in doing the bunny hop!
Caught! Oh well, I bet he helps you feed those little cuties!
ha ha!
Whoops!
Maybe he can taste test them...If they're good, he can eat them all himself. LOL.
Hahaha!
Stanley doesn't look too cross though... I think he secretly loves the bunnies just as much as you!
Kay :)
Owwww you are such a sweet woman......do you see your husband ???....i am not...i only see a rabbit !!!....xxx...hahahahhaha!!
Hi Catherine I love the colors of your pumkin chews,sweet post again!!!
hugs......x
I have a feeling that Stanley is not the least bit surprised that you are feeding those cute bunnies! :)
I say give Stanley a beer and tell him they are snacks for those long golf games. :) Have a great rest of the week. Bunny hugs, Tammy
So busted!!! lol Have a great day and thanks for the comment. :)
Uh oh, you are so busted. That doesn't look like an angry face on Stanley though
I have to agree with other comments...he doesn't look too upset.
Plus as long as the bunnies eat the chews they won't be noshing on your garden, right?
Makes total sense to me, teehee!
BUSTED!! Well...uh...you can tell him that they are for the neighborhood hamsters---they are on the bag, right? ;)
Aw, Stanley doesn't look too mad!
OOPS.... At least, Stanley doesn't look too upset!!!!!! ha
I feed the birds and we do everything in our power NOT to feed the squirrels and chipmunks (who also love the bird food).
Hugs,
Betsy
Love the kitty statuary! so fun!
LOL! Your post is too cute...as always!
Love what Sandra had to say!
Those pumpkin chews look good enough to eat. Do the bunnies share?? XO
Complimenti, è una bellissima idea! felice giornata...ciao
Well I feed the birds so there is surely nothing wrong with the rabbits too... (as long as I've given up vegetable gardening).....
Tell him it's health food snacks:)
Dearest Catherine,
That was a very fun and colorful post! Love your house pet and your outdoor pets...
Enjoy your weekend.
Love,
Mariette
So cool that Stanley caught you and is still being so cute about it!! haha
I have a sneaking suspicion it's all an act with him. lol
Too funny..

On today’s arena vote
Posted: September 24th, 2012 under Councilmember Bagshaw.
Tags: Budget and Economic Development, Environment, Seattle Center, Sports Arena
I am pleased that after months of discussion, we are seriously considering a new arena for our SuperSonics and potentially an NHL team.
I have moved from “Really? Spend public money on yet another sports arena?” to a qualified, “Yes.” The proposed plan can work for the people and entities that concern me deeply: the City itself, our taxpayers, our workers, our neighborhoods, the Port, our Seattle Center, and yes, our sports fans.
I thought I would describe the trail I have walked because it has been a rocky one for me.
I have read every article I could get my hands on – pro and con – and listened to hundreds of people who will be affected by the arena decision. Emotions have been running high, and my inbox has been overflowing with very strongly worded opinions on various sides of Chris Hansen’s proposal.
After months of debate with interested parties and my Council colleagues, I have concluded that the arena deal CAN be a success, and that it will succeed if we work collaboratively to minimize potential collateral damage and maximize the benefits to the public.
Here is how I initially framed the needs of a public-private deal, and how I am looking at it now:
Financial Benefits
My fundamental bottom line has been that the financial benefits of the deal to the City, the taxpayers and to the region must be documentable and compelling.
The financial benefits of the new deal have been discussed at length and have been significantly improved since the deal was first shared with the Council. As now drafted, the City and County will be reimbursed for reasonable development costs; for the thirty years of the lease term, ArenaCo will lease the ground from the City; ArenaCo is responsible for owning, installing and maintaining all the amenities of a new arena; the City will be repaid the amount it issues in tax-exempt bonds through the arena’s tax revenues which include incremental property tax, sales tax, admission tax attributable to the new arena and more. The revenues are backed by reserve accounts, capital accounts, Chris Hansen (and his successor) person guarantee, and a first priority payment position for the City and County. And, at the end of the 30 years, the City can require ArenaCo to buy the arena so the City will not be stuck with an aging and costly facility.
Some people have asked me, “Why not issue bonds and invest the money instead in things we need like our roads and schools?” The answer is simple. We don’t have a new dedicated revenue stream to pay back hypothetical capital investments and our taxpayers would be responsible for paying additional property taxes. The arena is different. We WILL have a new dedicated source of money that will be repaid by users of the arena. This makes a difference to how I look at it.
I appreciate that Chris Hansen and his partners have negotiated in good faith with the City and County Councils and now agree to put enough money into escrow accounts that the public investment will be protected and repaid, and repayment will be guaranteed by the private investors. That’s progress.
Impacts to Port, Freight, Maritime and Aviation Industries
I started from the position that the maritime and aviation industries, and accompanying family-wage jobs, must not be negatively impacted by the addition of a professional sports arena in the industrial area. This remains of critical importance to me.
I have taken the concerns of the Port, Freight, Maritime, and Aviation industries very seriously. I have met with leaders from each of these industries and businesses. The fact that leaders from each of these industries have stepped forward and are now working with the City and County and Port of Seattle to collectively to address freight corridor needs is a positive development. Billions of dollars of exports and imports and thousands of family wage jobs depend on this corridor. Although the freight corridor improvements have renewed interest because of the Arena discussions, we can capitalize on this opportunity, work with our allies and reach out to the Port of Tacoma, to our trading partners around the state, to our state legislators for support. We must promote ourselves as a competitive region, and stop being competitors between one another.
Impacts to the Neighborhoods
The people who live and work in the immediate area of the proposed new arena must receive a tangible benefit. Pedestrians, business owners, residents, transit riders, drivers, bicycle riders must be assured of better connections and separated ped/bike network as a result of the proposed new arena.
We can build on the good ideas already generated by the neighborhood business and neighborhood coalitions to grow the healthy businesses, invite new businesses to the neighborhoods, and make the neighborhoods places where people want to be on game days and when games are not happening.
Wherever the Arena is ultimately sited, I want to bring leaders from affected neighborhoods to the table soon so they can help articulate their concerns and the City and ArenaCo can bring tools to solve the problems raised.
Traffic Congestion
Traffic congestion in the immediate and adjoining neighborhoods, including West Seattle, downtown and SODO-south must be carefully considered and addressed. Freight mobility to I-5 and I-90 must be enhanced.
This is one of the primary issues and discussions are already underway. Enough said for now.
Key Arena and Seattle Center
The decision to build a new stadium must take into consideration the impacts on Seattle Center and Key Arena and repurpose Key Arena as the anchor of Seattle Center.
This is the big one for me. As Tim Burgess recently said, “Seattle Center is part civic square, part arts and sports venue, part school, park and open space. It’s a safe place where people gather …and the world to play, reflect, learn, watch and cheer. It’s a prize of immense value.”
Amen.
Although a modest amount of funding has been included in the arena deal to reexamine the possibilities and vision for Key Arena and the Center as a whole, it’s not enough. Sure, we have required that an Environmental Impact Statement study the Seattle Center as a new arena site; however, if another site is chosen, we must decide how Seattle Center will thrive and the Key Arena can complement—not compete—with the new arena.
Some have recently said that the Key is dead. I think that is dead wrong.
We have been handed an opportunity to build on the good work that so many have done before us, including those who drafted the Seattle Center Master Plan in 2008 and the current Seattle Center Advisory Committee (SCAC). The SCAC is the first to admit that the Key Arena cannot sustain itself “as is” if a new arena is built. They advocated for an in-depth study back in July, and we are going to do just that.
It’s too soon to talk specifics, but I’m committed to ensuring that the people most directly affected by changes to Key Arena – including nearby residents and businesses, employees, Seattle Public Schools and non-profit tenants at and near the Center – have a voice in what happens next. We can bring a high-octane stakeholder group together, just as we have for the Waterfront. It’s worked.
Without limiting ideas in any way for the future of Key Arena and Seattle Center as a whole, I have been delighted to see people proposing their own innovative suggestions such as a revitalized “Title IX” arena that would become premier event space for women’s collegiate and high school sports including basketball, volleyball, and tennis.
Or as one local Olympic swimmer suggested, how about turning Key Arena into a much needed Aquatic Center for the city? He explained, “One of the most expensive aspects of building a first class facility is the expense to span a large pool. With Key Arena, only the pool facility would be needed, the building, locker rooms, seating, etc, already exists! A prefab Myrtha Pool could be put into Key Arena for minimal cost. A 50-m competition and training facility would be accommodated and additional facilities and equipment such as water slides could easily be added in the building.”
We will take this opportunity to investigate what can be done. We must fund a study and devote serious capital funding to embrace Seattle Center as never before. The City deserves it; the Center deserves it.
The Council should identify the best location for a new arena
From the beginning, I stated that the city should encourage investment in locations where the investment would promote our regional land use objectives. In partnership with prospective investors, we must determine where the best location will be for a proposed new stadium.
This will require a thorough State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) analysis which we have required in our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). As approved, we acknowledge that Chris Hansen has his eyes on a particular site. Although SODO is Mr. Hansen’s preference, the City is committed to a process that requires an unbiased and thorough EIS to be conducted and other sites to be reviewed. This is not only a legal requirement, but a responsible approach as well.
For example, representatives from the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund wrote about the possibility of exploring the site of the old Sicks’ Stadium, located on Rainier and South McLellan (currently a Lowe’s is sited there), as an alternative and positive site. In their editorial, former Councilmember Richard McIver and David Essig, Director of Community Development described what a benefit a new arena would be to that area of our city. It’s near light rail, it’s near freeway on and off ramps, it would have the support of labor and presumably the Port, and it would help with economic infill where we really need it.
The point is that we should keep our eyes and minds wide open and do an environmental review considering alternative sites that is truly meaningful.
So there’s the summary. We’ve come a long way in a few months, and the journey is just starting.

GREEN YOUR VIDEO - by Brad Lakritz
Here’s your chance to have fun, make a difference in the world,
and learn all at the same time. We will partner with the people at Next
Generation, the North Bay’s leading progressive youth activist
organization, to create a documentary as part of their “Green
Your School” initiative. Students will document the exciting
projects other students are initiating to make their schools more sustainable,
including solar power, organic food, fair trade clothing, eco-friendly
transportation and green building projects. The film will be used nationwide
to encourage other groups to “green their school.”
Our week will start with a brief look at documentary techniques and learning
about how to tell a story and conduct an
interview. We will quickly move into production mode by visiting other
schools in our area to document their green
school efforts. We will go into post production in MA’s Multimedia
lab by Tuesday. Working in teams we will use Apple’s Final Cut Pro
and other image, sound, and video editing applications to create the final
video documentary. By Friday we will publish our own DVD and screen it
for the community at the end of the day.
There are other media related opportunities during the week (time permitting)
including web site production. Students can receive a semester project
service learning credit for this Mini-Course and anyone interested in
doing a year long Service Learning project with Next Generation should
contact Heather Hamilton.
Note: This is an on campus Minicourse however we will
make trips on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to visit and film at a few
different school sites.

Pre Sick Day: I think I might be getting sick. Yes. Definitely. No. Maybe not. Allergies? Just tired? No, I'm getting sick. X was sick last week and I probably picked it up there.
Pre-Sick Night: Ugh, I'm definitely getting sick. Stupid sore throat. So scratchy and hard to swallow. It burns! It burns!
Day one: Oh, hey. It's not that bad really.My sore throat feels a little better. I can beat this thing no problem! Bring on the OJ and soup! I'm winning, I'm winning!
Night one: Oh. my. god. My brain is clogged with phlegm and it's running out my nose unstoppably. I've used up all the toilet paper in the downstairs bathroom because we have no tissues. I'm sleeping with a bandanna under my nostrils to keep my pillow dry. Just let that snot flow, baby. Ugh, I feel like crap.
Day Two: Oh, my god. I'm going to die. I can't breathe. Every time I swallow my ears make a crazy glugging sound and then I can't hear right for a few minutes. I can't taste anything. Every fiber in my body aches. I can hardly keep my eyes open. When I blink I hear my eyeballs creaking. I'll never be healthy again. Waaaahhh!
Night two: I will never again be able to sleep. If I breathe through my mouth, my lips, tongue and throat become the Mojave and I wake up unable to produce saliva or swallow. But if I try to breathe through my nose, I die of suffocation. I'll just make a little tent around my head out of my blankets and breathe through my mouth under here like a little virus-breath-filled steam tent. Still no sleep.
Day three: Hey, I can breathe a little bit! I haven't had to wipe snot for the past 30 minutes! Cool! Wow...look at my nose. Red, raw, flaking skin. Disgusting. Hawrk, hack, cough, Have I been smoking for 40 years? That is one hell of a barking cough. I go to the store for some cough drops and people look at me like I've got TB. What are you lookin' at, you stupid healthy people. Get outta my way or you're next.
Night three: Can't sleep. Can't lay flat without coughing fit waking me every time I start to drift off. If I cough one more time like that I'll either vomit, hack up a laryngeal fold or cry. Maybe all three. But wow...I think this might be a good abdominal work out program. I will spend the night in the recliner chair watching Youtube videos, drinking tea and feeling sorry for myself.
Day four: F-U cold! Fine, you're winning. Whatever. I am going to the store and I'm buying DRUGS, dammit! Did you hear me, coronavirus! I'm gonna bring the 'Quil hate to rain down of your MF-ing head, beatch! You're not keeping me down anymore! I've got things to do, people to see, important life to live! Ah...Dayquil. The friendly kid sister to the Nyquil nighttime bully. Relief. Why didn't I take drugs sooner?
Night Four: Well, hello there, anise flavored, syrupy green, elixir for the sick...where have you been all my life. Ah...the taste of sleep and crazy effed up dreams. Thank you, Nyquil. I love you. See you again tomorrow night?
And so ends the story of the first four days of a coronavirus' trajectory.
of note: I am not currently sick nor do I hope to become sick with anything common or uncommon. Thanks for sparing me from your potential germs, M.

Note: Water Vikings and Shadow Troops were switched due to a neglect of the Water Vikings’ Saturday Event.
As what very well may be the climax of armies approaches during the conflict of the White Alliance and Black Alliance, let’s take a look at how the greatest armies of Club Penguin are stacking up.
Top Ten Armies
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
1. Special Weapons and Tactics [+3] [89.88]
2T. Dark Warriors [+1] [84.88]
2T. Army Republic [-1] [84.88]
4. Ice Warriors [+4] [79.75]
5. Army of CP [-4] [74.88]
6. Nachos [-1] [68.88]
7. Pirates [-1] [64.75]
8. Golden Troops [-1] [63.88]
9T. Pretzels [NEW!] [54.75]
9T. Water Vikings [+0] [54.75]
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Close to the Top Ten:
11. Shadow Troops [+1]
12. Chaos Army [+1]
13. Night Warriors [-3]
14. N/A
15. N/A
1. Special Weapons and Tactics: The SWAT take first in the Top Ten with a great showing this week. They began the week with the Defense of Migrator, where they averaged 20-25. They also won the Battle of Alaska only two days later. The next, they also defeated the ACP on the server of Snow Fort, with sizes of 15-20. They also won the Battle of Snow Globe on Friday. As the war with the ACP continued on, SWAT made a post saying they would ‘assassinate Snaily, ACP 3ic, on January 18th.’ The are one of many armies in the BA to have been targeting Snaily recently. That same day, the had yet another victory on the server of Snow Fort. However, the army’s event of the week only yesterday, averaging 30 during the Invasion of Breeze. SWAT has joined the Black Alliance as the WA/BA conflict begins to develop.
2T. Dark Warriors: The Dark Warriors gain a spot this week, one of the central armies of the WA/BA conflict. Their first event of the week took place on Thursday, a raid of the Golden Troops, where they averaged 20. They also claimed victory the next day on the server of Flurry, and on the server of Cozy the following day. The war with GT continued, as much of a flame war as an actual war, as the Dark Warriors claimed victory on the server of Marshmellow, and Belly Slide. The Dark Warriors would go on to claim victory on the servers of Ascent and Yeti. Now, as the week comes to an end, the Dark Warriors have pulled out of the Black Alliance, causing a big blow to the faction.
2T. Army Republic: The Army Republic falls one place this week, coming in at 2nd. The week began as AR defeated the Golden Troops, with a maximum size of 27. On Friday, the army had a U-Lead session with sizes of 25-30. Two days later, as the White Alliance formed, the AR posted the results of their first event. However, they cited that it was in no way a Declaration of War — that this was meant to scare the BA. Capncook, AR Leader, was quoted in saying that the AR is ‘at the forefront of the White Alliance.’
4. Ice Warriors: The Ice Warriors placed 4th this week. They got right to work as the week began, with a training session last Sunday, with sizes of 20-25. Two days later, they had another training session, maxing a mere 8. The next two days the Ice Warriors would have two other less than adequate training session, with sizes between 5 and 10. However, yesterday the Ice Warriors had very nice sizes of 20-25 during a practice battle with the Army Republic. Jack, Ice Warriors 2ic, is playing a large part in the White Alliance, but it is yet to be cited whether or not Albert147, IW Leader, will pull the army in. Aquabluejet also reported to remain in the race for the leadership.
5. Army of CP: The ACP started off extremely strong as the week began, but their performance in the middle and end of the week lands them fifth this week. They had truly amazing sizes of 35-40 on the servers of Klondike and Breeze as the week began, and sizes of 20-25 during the Battle of Migrator, despite some chat problems. The next day, the battle with the Pirates on Klondike ended with a draw, the ACP getting sizes of 13. They also claimed victory on Breeze against the Pirates that same day. Also, that day, they lost on the servers of Alaska and Berg. The next day, ACP claimed victory on Chinook with sizes of around 15. On Thursday, the army claimed victory on Summit, Christmas, and Snow Globe later in the day, however the Council claimed differently in certain instances. ACP also claimed victory on Fiesta and Avalance on Friday. Yesterday, the ACP claimed victory against a force comprised of ST, SWAT, and Pirates on the server of Snow Fort. That same day, they claimed victory on Breeze as Snaily, ACP 3ic, requested that Funks promote one of the American owners to Co-Leader in a controversial post. The ACP is reported to be a part of the White Alliance, and Antant98 is reported to have left the army and joined AR for a mod rank.
6. Nachos: The Nachos have fallen one spot down to 6th this week. Having a relatively slow week, they scheduled a practice battle against the UMA in the beginning in the week. However, the results post was never posted. Nor was the results post for a training session that was scheduled a day later for the 16th. Puckley, Nachos leader, called for a change in the army, making a post on how the Nachos can improve from where they are at. This included reinforcing chat activeness. The highlight of their week was the Nachos practice battle against GT, in where they maxed around 25. They hope to continue to put forth more effort top stop their fall.
7. Pirates: This week the Pirates have fallen to the 7th spot. Despite their drop, they had a tremendously active week. Ranging from the rise of their American division (who have proved to help their position in the war immensely), to the invasion of their enemy, the ACP. They successfully invaded Mammoth, one of ACP’s most precious servers. One of Pirates’ figureheads, Max, tried to take matters into his own hands in the war against ACP. Disregarding Water’s own actions; it is not know what he exactly did, but there might be some fighting between the owner positions. Though, despite the Pirates having a good week in their war, they continue to show they won’t change their rude actions. This includes showing real life pictures of an ACP owner Foldez which went unaccounted for. Will the Pirates action be justified?
8. Golden Troops: The GT army of CP has fallen this week by one spot. They started the week off with spectacular training sessions. Following these magnificent events, they declared war on DW; whom are one of the big top dogs of armies these days. The war was going fairly good for the GT. Showing they can hold off their own against a bigger army. Once the war ended, they were deciding if to join the WA. They are still deciding as time their site shows.
9T. Pretzels: Pretzels rose up to the ninth spot this week. They started and ended a war against the Chaos all in one week. Beginning their week off, they invaded Glacier. Adding it back as their capital to the nation. With great sizes, the Chaos were not match for them. The war was only 4 battles long until it was decided that peace would be made between the two. Already they are planning for a rebuild from the war by training.
9T. Water Vikings: The Water Vikings barely are able to retain 9th this week after a relatively slow week. Their first event was the Invasion of Cozy, where they met some unexpected opposition from the Golden Troops. They were able to average about 13. After some events without results posts, they had a practice battle with the Night Warriors and won, with good sizes of 15+. They have yet to schedule any events this week.

Word of the Week
‘Alliance’
Yes, the first ever word of the week is ‘Alliance’. From the White Alliance to the Black Alliance, the end of this week has certainly been extremely interesting. And, while we are on the subject of this war, I can’t help but voice my opinion on it. I’m not on either side in the war as I am in CPAC only, but this is my overall opinion:
This war is going to change nothing. You have divided warfare into two main factions with no room for those who do not want to get involved. Neither of you are going to admit defeat – at the end of the day, I see three main options. If this war continues, we either see the death of the armies in the White Alliance (AR, ACP, Nachos) or the death of the armies in the Black Alliance (SWAT, ST, Pirates). Either way, a large chunk of armies is lost. What do you gain from killing ACP? I have my issues with ACP as much as the next guy, but ACP is no longer the number one army. You are targeting it because of a misguided moral that has become accepted over the past, say, four years, because it made sense during those four years. In any case, this war is not going to fix anything in armies — unless you consider the end fixing something. But being the king of a destroyed city has no more glory to it than it ever has. For CPAC, I’m Bluesockwa1.

1. Jack lied about Aqua dropping out in the IW race.
2. GT doesn’t deserve Top 10
(I’m GT Leader, so that’s saying something)
Nice Top Ten, Good to see somebody else besides the Dark Warriors in First.
Wut, judging on the given picture WV did way better than ST, this has to be like the third time WV have been wrongly placed.
Who the hell said I was dropping out of the Ice Warriors leader elections? Jesus christ, I say Jack would make a good leader and everyone immediatly thinks im dropping out.
[...] week of events and after we beat Chaos in a War 3-1, we have recived the number 9th spot on CPAC! Good job to all of you for helping us get this spot on CPAC! But remember we ae tied for 9th, we [...]
Please edit ST’s picture, use instead.
White and Black alliance? We aren’t the white alliance are we, where did that come from? Don’t try and make this racist! xD

Seems a lot like Jack made WA for publicity since we didn’t need it in the first place
And by making up the lie that I was dropping out of leader elections for IW.
Whoot nice job PCP

Ugh. You switch ST because of neglection, but you NEGLECT the picture I comment of ST clearly bigger then WV with more tactical success.
You NEGLECT to realize that picture was from Friday, January 11th. We saw the picture, but looked for confirmation. The picture was not valid. Good day to you sir.

I can’t see CP army warfare dying without ACP.
I love how Tacos thought that they could kick SWAT’s asses when SWAT got 1st and Tacos are dead as fuck. I haven’t seen Tacos in the Top 10 since they have came back, or even the Top 15.

Does anyone know if we can buy the phone directly from RIMM....ooopps I mean BlackBerry?
Like maybe from their website?
Apple allows you too... I am wondering if we can instead of waiting until March if we are willing to pay full price for it.

If you need one now, go to EBay. People are paying thousands for these phones.
iwasspartacus Jan 31, 2013 at 10:42 pm
Well, you've heard of cross border shopping right? Just get it delivered to your American address or ask who is visiting Canada soon (I work on a project where half the consultants fly home to the U.S. every Thursday afternoon ... I'm in Calgary - going to play with a Z10 next week at BestBuy... Yay!!!!).

I'm glad it's launching in the UK first. It's a nice reward to the loyal fan base there (much more loyal than the U.S.)
iwasspartacus Jan 31, 2013 at 10:47 pm
B.I.N.G.O.
It's why the U.S. is one of last to receive phones, it's going to be an uphill battle - nothing like a month of traction GLOBALLY to generate some buzz and build anticipation for our Yankee friends.
framos242 Jan 31, 2013 at 12:17 pm
I'm so jealous of the UK addicts...
koolrosh Jan 31, 2013 at 12:17 pm
Do they have enough phones for all those people?
DCMMID Jan 31, 2013 at 12:17 pm
The momentum from this early availability would have been a good going into a US release ... if ... the US release was in 2 weeks.

It will bring tumble weeds and cob webs. :(
stevejb Jan 31, 2013 at 1:11 pm
I'd say due the reported lack of interest in BB anymore in the US, there wouldn't be lines.
Which is probably why UK get the release first and NA have to wait.
W Hoa Jan 31, 2013 at 2:15 pm
Not all of NA has to wait. Just the US part. And to be technically correct the Mexico part too.

You can get it from ebay for about $1,500.00

grnrprl Jan 31, 2013 at 12:25 pm
Where was it and what for? I went today to one of Carphones to have a look at Z10. First of all there was no queue. They had two dummy Z10: black and white. They looked like a plastic toys! Is it true the back of original Z10 is plastic and looks almost like the one of LG L3 for £49.00?
MikeGS Jan 31, 2013 at 12:28 pm
The Dummy units are not a patch on the actual units. Handled a couple today for 10 minutes and they feel great in the hand. Although they use plastic in the build they feel sturdy. Compared to the GS3, one in each hand, there is no comparison. The soft touch back is sublime, I wanted to rub my face on it!
grnrprl Jan 31, 2013 at 1:20 pm
I'm sad because I was expecting something like PlayBook's rubber. I like it very much.
Abrante Jan 31, 2013 at 12:29 pm
"They looked like a plastic toys", what were you expecting the screen to turn on and off? You know there's a reason why they are called dummy phones right?
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:38 pm
No he doesn't because he is a dummy!
Abrante Jan 31, 2013 at 12:30 pm
-Double entry-
grnrprl Jan 31, 2013 at 12:44 pm
Please, read my question - it relates to the battery cover of the Z10. I love the one from 9780 or even 9860.
Abrante Jan 31, 2013 at 12:48 pm
I see. I did like the 9780 door too. But, lets face it, most people put "phone condoms" most of the time. so the feel might not mean much to the average user.
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:39 pm
yes if you have an iphone.....i want a phone that is tough and no dummy cover....they are completely stupid.
MikeGS Jan 31, 2013 at 12:25 pm
Picked up three Z10's today from Phones4U. Not for me though :-(
Vodafone wouldn't sell them without a NEW contract. Ridiculous.
Jimcmf Jan 31, 2013 at 8:46 pm
Mike - How much did you pay? Did you wait in line at all?
cgk Jan 31, 2013 at 12:35 pm
What this article 'forgets' to mention is that the store in question had an appearance from Pixi Lotte (Popular singer in the UK) and they were giving playbooks out to the first 250 purchases - even Phone4u where the picture comes from titled it
"Queuing to see Pixie at the launch of the @UK_BlackBerry in white on Oxford St London"
So anyone got any pictures of queues where there are no celebrity appearances?
Anyone got one of those and we have something to talk about....
EDIT: The article has been edited to include the Pixi Lotte appearance - so no I didn't miss it when I read it.
revtech Jan 31, 2013 at 12:43 pm
Thanks for the wet blanket . . Because we know that certainly no one else would stoop so low as to try marketing a product using local celebrities
QC_Al Jan 31, 2013 at 2:15 pm
Hi, huge BB fan and supporter here. However I do somewhat agree. I want to see what's going on at the stores without celebrity appearances and freebies being handed out. Just sayin'. I WILL be getting mine next week in Canada though eh!
randall2580 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:40 pm
The implication of this picture, without a mention of the give away or the celebrity, is that this is representative of all the UK stores selling BB10 today. The question is, is that a fair representation? There are enough CrackBerrians who are in the UK to tell us their anecdotal evidence at the local stores around the Country.
I have bought most every major BB release on launch day here in the States (I got the 9810 instead of the 9900) and I have never had to wait on a line except the normal cue at the local AT&T Corp store so if I had to wait on a line like this - you bet I would report it here.
Just Me Feb 1, 2013 at 2:02 pm
I'm a big BB fan but there is not a chance I would ever wait in line to pay for a new phone. I would just come back the next day. I'll leave the lining up for the people who enjoy that kind of thing. In the meantime I'll be Skiing.
HasKam Jan 31, 2013 at 12:30 pm
Got mine yesterday at the launch, and i really love it. took me a while to get used to navigating around, but its almost second nature now.
you guys wont be disappointed when you get your hands on it.
Only complaint is the apps, which are not that great. but as we have heard, some big names are coming very soon.
Oh and the micro sim is a pain. took forever to get my numbers on it.
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:41 pm

BlackBerries are typically available at too many locations for this to happen.

luc aubuchon Jan 31, 2013 at 12:40 pm
I guess so haha On a serious note, it is a shame that a Canadian Company distribute their phone in a different country on the opening day.
bbfanboi Jan 31, 2013 at 4:31 pm
Unfortunately, the carriers rule. They own the networks.

luc aubuchon Jan 31, 2013 at 12:41 pm
Anyone knows when the update will come for the Playbook ? This is what I'm waiting for right now.
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:43 pm
Agree....If we had BB10 on our playbook and bridged our old Bold 9000 as I am doing now, wouldn't need a BB10 phone....seriously that is why I think they will delay the BB10 software for the playbook.
Fucking Asshole Jan 31, 2013 at 12:49 pm
Why do people buy products when they first come out? If I was going to buy this phone I would wait at least 6 months or at least until the first update. No way would I buy this the day after launch.
Besides, anyone who stands in long lines like in the photo to buy a phone clearly has nothing else to do.
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:44 pm
If you live in the States you will get your way.....just kidding....lol

Um, who's Pixi Lotte?
AtomicFrost Jan 31, 2013 at 1:13 pm
Sounds like she is some pop singer in the UK. However, it looks like her last name is spelled without the e?
I hope that the Z10 sells well in Europe. A third solid competing OS in the smartphone market will help push more innovation in the marketplace. :)
cbdwolff7 Jan 31, 2013 at 1:16 pm
Big Mistake not having it available in US!! Stock down, 2 of my friends heading to other devices. Can"t seem to WAIT any longer. They are starting to use it as RIMM's (Blackberry) middle name. WAIT WAIT WAIT!! It is very frustrating.
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:54 pm
Stock is down due to profit taking.....i will watch for the bottom, buy back in and make more easy money.....as for your 2 friends, their short sightedness will come back to haunt them......they will have to wait even longer for their new contracts to expire so they can get the phone everyone is going to want....PS....don't let them drool all over yours.....lol.
jimmychen17 Jan 31, 2013 at 1:19 pm
Can anyone confirm if the Z10 supports ActiveSync? i.e., I can get Outlook emails just like my old iPhone but without the enterprise plan -
I don't seem to find any 'official' info on BlackBerry's web site - and have to dig through forums .....
br14 Jan 31, 2013 at 1:56 pm
Believe I read a review saying ActiveSync is supported (might even be the default for non-corporate).
pmccartney Jan 31, 2013 at 4:09 pm
Yes absolutely 100%. Activesync and or BES10
tw_ Jan 31, 2013 at 7:08 pm
Yes, the Z10 supports ActiveSync. No enterprise plan needed. I can confirm that.
AdamCockley Jan 31, 2013 at 1:22 pm
I'm located in the UK and I have excited that Z10s was realising today but looked online and they are only selling the black ones, the white is coming out on the 18th Feb!! So gutted. Feel sorrow to the folks in The US.
Like to note that there's a good deal with o2 unlimited Mins&Texts 1GB data for £26pm £99 upfront cost!
beemaabeemababy Jan 31, 2013 at 1:33 pm
Phones4u have exclusivity on the white Z10 for now. That's why you can't get it anywhere else. And that's why I called them at 9am this morning (when their upgrades lines opened) to have my new white BlackBerry delivered. I would have done the trek to London for the chance to get another 64gb PlayBook, but I have work!
jocu Jan 31, 2013 at 3:33 pm
Just checked the O2.co.uk website as this deal seemed too good to be true! The upfront cost is listed as £199, not £99 - perhaps it was a mis-print that was later corrected!
beemaabeemababy Jan 31, 2013 at 5:12 pm
I managed to get the phone for free on an upgrade. Unlimited minutes and texts, 1GB data, 2gb wifi hotspot access on a 24 month contract. All for £37/month. Not much data, I know. But I'm always in a wifi area these days.
djrupey Jan 31, 2013 at 1:36 pm
My BlackBerry experience is just over four years, Storm only, and two Playbooks. The PlayBooks are fantastic and gave me confidence that BB10 would be a great OS, although I had no illusions about it being perfect from day one.
So here in the UK I ordered from Vodafone at 9.30am this morning online. There was some confusion about my details even though I have been a Vodafone customer for 25 years! Anyway, my order had to be cancelled and then re-entered at about 3pm, by which time they had apparently sold out. I began to despair. But at last I was put through to someone who I assume was a manager and he could not have been more helpful. He said that they would hopefully be showing stock again in 30 mins, and assured me that if that was the case I'd have my Z10 tomorrow (Friday 1st Feb). If not, it would be Monday.
Needless to say I am beside myself with excitement. It has been a long two-year wait since my Storm 1 contract expired, so I went on a SIM-only contract while I waited patiently for BB10. I did not want to get tied into an OS 7 phone as it would have delayed my experience of what I came to see as a major, quantum leap forward for PlackBerry phones. Besides, my Storm had finally come good and was giving reliable service. I decided that I did not want to start all over again with a different ecosystem even though iPhone and Samsung seemed all the rage.
So, all being well, tomorrow I will be a BB Z10 person at last. It's been a long, long wait. Whether it is tomorrow or Monday, I will start a diary thread about my Z10 experience so that those yet to receive theirs will have some idea of what to expect, from the perspective of an ordinary non-techie user.
beemaabeemababy Jan 31, 2013 at 1:37 pm
During my 9am call to phones4u this morning, the lady told me that she had 30 callers in the queue by about 9:15. By 9:30 when my upgrade was finalised, she told me that there were now 50 people in the queue! Seems like a strong demand first thing in the morning!

Just like me i should be receiving my Z10 tomorrow I received a text saying it was dispatched today, and like yourself I'll keep a working diary of how things are..I've had both storms and the 9800 so this is a major step up for all of us good luck by the way.
TommiTommi Jan 31, 2013 at 2:08 pm
Went in to a Phones4U in London this morning at about 11:30. I asked about BB10 and the chap gave me a demo unit to try. I think it is great - genuinely different interface, brilliant keypad (the best virtual one I have ever used) and competitive pricing.
My contract is up in June for my 9105, I will be getting either the Z10 or Q10 in its place! (BTW there was no queue or crowd there- but that might have been earlier!)
TommiTommi Jan 31, 2013 at 2:14 pm
Pixie Lott is a pretty decent singer and well known here in the UK. One of her best songs 'All About Tonight' is great - in the video she uses a phone - but not a Blackberry!
Playbook007 Jan 31, 2013 at 2:59 pm
I am glad that the UK received their phones today.....nice to see some chaps who can actually type the english language......way to go mates!
ksean007 Jan 31, 2013 at 4:00 pm
Hi everyone I'm really sorry to hear of the USA delays, I used to live in NY for around 24 years and became a fan of blackberry quite a few years ago and now that I'm back in the UK and have been. With O2. For ages I was quite surprised at how they kept the release date hush hush..today I received a text to say the BB Z10 was available so I logged on to my account and within 5 minutes they sent a message saying it was dispatched and i should be receiving it tomorrow...my plan is on contract for 24 months and the phone is free @ £36 a month I will keep everyone in the loop. With my verdict but it looks damn good so far..here's hoping they speed things up so you can experience the new BlackBerry.
twidget2iwo Jan 31, 2013 at 4:18 pm
Luckily I didn't have to wait in line at all in Harrogate. Both Phones4U and Vodafone had a few in stock, and no one was queuing to get one.
I LOVE MY 10!!!
DuexNoir Jan 31, 2013 at 4:41 pm
Awesome fansmanship BB UK!! I can't wait to be able to join you guys next week on the 5th with my own Z10!

Hi everyone. Bought mine on EE today. £28.50/month over 24 months for 1000 texts and minutes and 1 gb of data. Then 50 for the phone. It is being delivered tomorrow! When I called in I was told a lot of people were ordering it. I then played around with the phone at the EE shop. The sales rep was very excited and I have to say that the phone felt and looked great.. Compared it in the hand with iPhone and Samsung. Looking forward to it!

Gives me some hope. I always wonder why people would line up for a stupid phone like the iPhone, but seeing that people are excited for a phone that's actually innovative makes more sense to me...
Jimcmf Jan 31, 2013 at 8:55 pm
We need more line ups !!!!
Everyone .... PLEASE go get one. We can BBM together.

OK, so that one shop had people outside because Pixie Lott was inside. Didn't happen in my city,in the morning I walk past 7 mobile phone shops on the way to work (at about 9am when they open). No-one was paying the slightest interest. i went into Phones4U on the way home, and had a look at a unit, spoke to a sales guy and asked about interest, and he said I was the first that had gone to the display all day (this was at 5.15pm).

THE INSIDER

COMPANY: The Garland Co., Cleveland
Garland, a maker of roofing and building maintenance products for the commercial, industrial and institutional markets, describes Quick-Slope as “an easy-to-apply material that redirects or disperses harmful standing water on low-slope modified bitumen roofing.”
The Quick-Slope material “is designed to reduce and redirect water toward existing scuppers or drains,” according to Garland. “It can also be used to provide increased localized slope.” The company says Quick-Slope “is a cost-effective alternative to adding drains or crickets, and provides a tenacious bond to new or existing smooth or mineral roof systems.” It also can be added to pond areas “to help water travel in multiple directions, thereby speeding up evaporation.” Once a surface is cleaned and prepared, Garland says, “the product can be troweled out in minutes, without removal of existing roofing material.” Garland product manager Rick Catley says Quick-Slope “is low-odor and non-volatile, so it can be applied without any disruption to the workplace, and with minimal waste.”.

Hey, Bostonites! I'll see you tonight at the Harvard Bookstore (1256 Mass Ave) at 7PM for the US launch of my new novel, Makers! (New Yorkers, and Philadelphians -- see you later this week!)
US/Canada tour
Can't make the reading due to nonprofit board meeting. :( Any chance you'll be getting drinks post-reading somewhere in Harvard Square?
Alas no -- 5AM train tomorrow morning!
Sorry I missed you! I left my copy of MAKERS with the bookstore staff for you to sign, because my daughter (2.5 years) was simply not able to wait peacefully until 7pm (otherwise known as the "why am I not eating dinner RIGHT NOW?" hour).
Hope the reading went well, and I am terribly sorry that I didn't get to talk with).

I love cream puffs and I haven’t had very many since my weight loss journey. So I decided to create low fat cream puff we can all enjoy. These are really easy to make and only require 2 ingredients.
Ingredients:
- 1 can of low fat Pillsbury Crescent Roll dough
- 1 can or tub of low/non fat cool whip
Directions:
- Pre heat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.
- Remove dough from package and roll in to a large ball.
- Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface about 1 centimeter thick.
- Grab a small to medium cookie cutter any shape and cut out cookies. I used a small 1 inch wide heart shape cookie cutter as it’s all I had on hand.
- Place cut dough on a cookie sheet.
- Cook at 375 degrees fahrenheit for about 10-15 mins or until the tops are lightly brown.
- Remove from oven and cool on a cooling rack.
- Once cooled cut the cookies down the center, fill with cool whip and enjoy.

Hey Kris. Thanks for the inviting welcome. I too, do not have cancer and I admit, I do feel weird posting sometimes. I'll definitely post more often. Thanks for the last post about death. I've had some weird moments lately regarding death, and you guys have put me at ease.
What awesome ideas! I love them all! How do you do it? Kris, you keep me coming back (nearly everyday) to read the blog because I know you are writing from a pure, sincere, beautiful place. I have so much respect for someone who can do it all as you do everyday with so much beauty, grace, giggles, and compassion. Bravo for finding that place to live where your heart can sing and we can can all benefit from your sweet, sweet music! Thank you!
Lots of lovin,
-Miss Kate
This town sounds awesome and such a lovely welcome! This book has been on my wishlist and it seems like the perfect time, and reason, to pick it up!
I am so glad you posted this...
I only comment occasionally because I feel like an outsider sometimes and I did have canSer. I think we can all feel isolated even in a room full of people just like ourselves. Building a community is a way to breakdown those barriers that keep us apart.
I am actually sitting on pins and needles right now waiting for follow-up test results and I am trying to distract myself. I am here and waving hello to everyone. I love the way this community is shaping up. Kris, you have the best ideas... I love the whats on your list of inclusive discussions.
Even those of us who have and cancer need to do other things and to have other interests to be whole. I am so on board... especially yes to the book club... and double yes to Micheal Pollen's new book. Mostly because it is in my purse right now and I have only read a page or two.
Hi. I admit I have been visiting this site for a couple of months and have never posted before. I do not have cancer but my husband does, he has pancreatic cancer and had surgery in June and is now undergoing chemo. A couple of weeks ago he was hospitalized and needed another surgery, so the road has been extremely rough for him, but he is brave and strong and is doing well. Kris, we watched your movie on TLC in October, and my husband even bought your book at Whole Foods. We have been incorporating many changes into our lives due to your inspiration. I come to this blog every morning, I feel like I know all of you and you give us such hope and inspiration. And Callie, I am so happy for you & Duncan, I've been thinking of you all week.
Hi everyone...as always, I love Kris's ideas -- especially the pix she chooses for her posts. Where DOES she get those? Inspires me to take my camera everywhere I go (since I live in Santa Fe, you know I can get some pretty weird stuff!).
Great idea re In Defense of Food. And since there seems to be a thumbs up on the Ipod discussion, here's my list. You can get everything on Itunes if you want, except, I think, Jana Stanfield. She's a fantastic indie and specializes in uplifting songs. Her website is. Her song Next Right Step is a rip-snorter. Okay, here's my list (it's a long one, I just couldn't help myself!:

GoodMorning Kris!
Mmmmm!Such a warm and yummy invite that only you can extend.My lack of posting has been to busy with the usual appts and trying to finish up treatment.In addition to chemo & radiation,I recieve Herceptin for a year.I'm on the homestretch.NINE count them,NINE more treatments!I'm starting to soar I feel the wind in my face!
It's time for me to start taking care of me.The doc's did their job,it's now my turn.
Soooo,what can I do for my poor lil body after surgeries,chemo&rads?How do I begin to repair that damage?I look forward to making changes in life,but humbly ask for guidance in my transition.I will wobble and stagger down the path..but down the path I will go.
I look forward toyour next book,and the book club and all of it!I'm so excited.Life is good,isn't it?
Muahh!Kisses to everyone!
Love,Peace and good vibes to all,
Linda
Kris, what the heck are we going to do with our Flavnoids person? There are what, 20 repeats here?
oh well, trying to stay calm. love all the ideas. i'll read whatever.
re the flavenoids guy...looks like our town got its first billboard. Or exhibitionist.
Was wondering what would happened to me if my surgery=test was negative next week.
Would I have to give this sweat community of bloggers? Hope for the worst so I could stay?
Wow, God bless Kris. Now I can rest...that I too am welcome. It is a universe filled with people searching. Now I can stop and just groove with Freddie Fender...When the next tear drop falls and join in knowing you guys will be there before the next one falls.
Kris, my dear young girl you must have your head on the heart of the most powerful universal being. Keep listening.
As for the book I am open to anything new, and healthy. I love learning. It helps an aging brain stay young.
Love the picture...always wanted to be a hippee. But Mom and Dad said no. Bummer. I still have a chance to be a hippee in my spirit.
I never heard of this author. Is he good? Mary a.k.a. mhc
I know gang, I am so sorry, flavanoids is like a hemmoroid. I don't think I can block him/it till I move the blog to my site. I've been digging around Blogger and the only option I can come up with so far is to make it so I have to approve every comment. Too much for me or to make members. Maybe we should do that. Flavs is a maniac with issues in the tissues.
Glad you all love the new ideas!!!!
xo
Ok. I will come out of hiding and post. :) I do feel like an outsider sometimes because I do not have canSer as well...but canser is all around me. I admire all of you and you all have taught me so much.
been juicing and been trying to get on the right track. nothing is keeping focused though. The thing is...I don't want the only way to keep my butt in gear or to have motivation is to actually GET canser! i want to do this for myself. my heatlh. to be gone with my yo-yoing once and for all, to stay healthy.
anyway, thanks for your post today kris! can't wait for the many more!
Hey Kris,
Fantasic!!! All of the ideas.. Wow.. Love the book selection. And thanks for all the new townies and town sites to come. Your city of pearls my love.
I love these Ipod selections. I know less I mean less than nothing about music but love it. I have books on my ipod.. from the week of hell... Eat Love Pray. I cannot wait to put on songs..
Thanks for all your loving kindness. Everything hit last night and Duncan and I spent the night laughing and crying and unwinding.. He does owe me some dancing.. but we were to tired to even move a toe. hahah..
I am now turning my prayers to Becky for tomorrow. Things will go over well!!! Know we love you and are there with you inside every breath.
OH and for the flavinoid folks because Kris is going to get crazy on them. Lets all just ignore them and let them be deleted.. they are rude and could go broke at this rate.
I am running off the saga of the week for a big blog oh the power of all of your thoughts and prayers on basicmissions.com it will be posted around 6 tonight. Not using anyones comments but mine just pulling my words.. come by and visit.
Sandra J. that tribute to your dad is so lovely. Beautiful he is smiling and proud of you. I bet you can feel that already .. And that Monica we need her to be a regular. You cannot keep those blogs a secret but leave it to a sister to out you right.
Alright. I am off. Work is calling and I am fiddling around wanting to take Saatchi to the beach for a break but I have a family in Cinncianti who has lost thier heat and they have a son with Acute lymphatic Leukemia and the bills are overwhelming them. It is criminal to be able to turn someones heat off when it is -10 degrees outside ... no matter what.
Well say a prayer for them. Love you all. Check in later.. Gooney honey you dont have to make me anything .. just send me a smile and know I love you. I am not turning away you gift just feel so humbled by the sheer thought of it I have no way to repsond. My favorite color is green it is my God color... but I love all colors..specailly the bright ones orange, pink, yellow, red, the ones that vibrate with joy. I love you by the way. You teach me something each day.
mch- you are on my heart today. Special prayers for you. And Kristy I am wanting to fly a banner with we're having a baby on it!!!!!!!!!!!!! first ever csc baby... but it will be one enlightened and well fed, happy healthy little buddha.
Hugs everyone. Callie
Going primitive
I did a quick read on the excerpt of Pollan's book. Excellent. I want to go there...
I have become very primitive lately in my art. Using fingers and palms instead of brushes seems to fit the deep moods I am in. I have even taken to twigs and leaves. My food going primitive is just one step further. It just seems to fit my style of life right now. The most primitive food I can think of...raw...before fire. Nuts, seeds, etc.
Hi Kris! I agree w/ you 100%...I have been loving this community for months, but haven't posted in a long time. Here's some love...
I think reading Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food together is a great idea! I just bought the book last week & have only read the introduction so far. It is awesome!
I also had to run out & buy Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth: Awakening Your Life's Purpose after seeing it is Oprah's new book club selection! I have to stop buying books lately & do more reading of them.
I am also very interested in healthcare in our country (and around the world.) I have been living w/ canser for 3 1/2 yrs & although I have excellent health insurance I do fear losin git or being denied care. And it hurts & makes me so angry to think of the millions of Americans who have no coverage! If you could inform us and possibly lead us in propelling our country toward free healthcare for all that would be amazing!
This blog is so incredible...I thank you for it, and I promise to add my voice more often.
love & miracles to all!
Kris...what a perfect post, once again. How exactly do you know exactly what is needed? Such a talent. Bravo ;)
Thanks all for your well wishes, congratulations and hip hip hoorays! It has been SUCH a long road to get here, and I am cautiously excited. I have another beta test tomorrow, so please pray that my numbers double. We need AT LEAST a level of 438... come on... big money... no whammies ! :)
I am SO happy to see all of the new members of the community speak out and introduce themselves. I know of the nervousness of which you speak. I too was there... why would I post about infertility or wanting to become pregnant on THIS blog??
I have found (and I am sure you have too) that this blog isn't for people with canSer or without, with an illness or without, with great knowledge or without... it is for all of us who want to live a better, healthier and more fulfilling life. Those kind of people have no boundaries... and thank goodness for that... cause look at this community... ROCK!
Namaste...
Kristy xo
Hey team, guess what I was looking forward to something to do after surgery. Turns out Pollan will be speaking in my state. Usually everything is on the other side of the country. Finally. UC Sanford, looks like a good one. Through his eat well site I found 4 farms in my area beside the health food store. Yippee!!!!
Hey there cowgirls :)
I am also one of those silent readers that never posts.
A day or two after I found out a close family member of mine had cancer, I stumbled upon your documentary Kris. What an emotional journey you've made... I felt very emotional watching it. It has been such a help to read your thoughts and those of some other posters to try to better understand how my aunt must feel... since she so rarely says anything about how she is feeling about it all.
Aside from that, I love seeing courage in the face of adversity. You are all such inspirations!
Thanks for the welcome :)
Geez i missed 2 posts! lol! I got some reading to do...Kris, I love all these ideas! books, pimp your ipod music lol! all the ideas-fun!
Great mission statement!
Also your picture for this post makes me wanna break out my birks! lol but I gave them away years ago after high school, my flipflops took over lol. ahhh I kinda wanna go out and buy a new pair of birks now! you bring out the hippie in me LOL
So are all these new ideas gonna be on the new forum then? about when is it gonna be up?
Looking forward to it :)
Your book pick looks like a cool book-cheap on amazon too :) ...(i <3 amazon lol)
rs-Manifesto/dp/1594201455/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product
Wow cool! Hi all you new people who are posting already! sweet! :)
Hi Kris!
I have posted here once or twice and now I feel better about it!! I don't have cancer, but I have Crohn's disease and I eat a vegan diet to help with it. In fact I haven't had a flare up in over a year!!! 2 years ago I was in a hospital getting blood transfusions!! I feel great now (although I do take a lot of meds).. and I hope to post more on your blog now that I feel more welcomed!!
Lauren N.
AP Monkey! Girrrrl. I was justing thinking about you. Where is she? Glad you are back. Yup. These ideas will be on the forum, but for now we'll start on the blog. My hope is that the forum will be up by my cancerversary (valentines day). If not, then by the end of Feb. Fingers crossed. We had to find someone else to do it and now we're very excited about the web team we are putting together. xo! K
I have to admit, uber excited about the forum, and the book club/iPod (I'm a total musicobsesser, which I guess comes in handy given my profession) discussions/and pretty much everything listed.
And yes, the flavnoids poster can be quite a hassle but let's face it, most people posting on here are well aware of good ways and positive ways to just breeze through and past the ugly stuff and focus on the beautiful ones right? RIGHT!
The picture makes me want to tug my Fryes up a little higher and dance around outside, but I have a feeling some professors would disapprove.
Welcome to everybody new and old! I missed the last few posts but I'm catching up now, I missed all you gorgeous peoples!
Following Kris’ lead about being a community, I would like to introduce myself and invite you all over for chats on the patio.
I wrote a brief comment here a few days ago, but want to ..
I have been smacking late stage lung canSer around for over 3 years now. It just did not know who it was messing with! I just finished my 45th chemo treatment. (Chemo treatment, # 39 on Alimta.) I work full time and live alone. That is the problem for me-I am a nervous nibbler and a bit tuckered when I get home, so have not made some of the changes I would like to make—like juicing and getting out for walks. I have so hated how it has changed my looks…until I began reading this blog. I was heartened to read that I was not alone. I was heartened to realize that it is not who I am… Thank you all for that.
I also thank you, my new community, for making me feel less alone in this. I have not felt comfortable participating in support groups and there is not center in my town that offers complimentary care, support… So, here is what I would like to do. I would like to create a day of healing. Bring together folks to offer yoga, journaling, nutrition, and the like. I would like to ask you all for suggestions on creating this day for kick ass cowgirls and cowboys (so appropriate, since I live in Wyoming!).
Thank you all. Callie and Duncan-Wahoo! You don't know how many days your words have guided me.
Hugs, Chris in Wyoming
Count me in! I'm quiet at times but still reading...I also write on my blog (daily) and was inspired by this post for my post today, so thanks!
Rach
Kris, Thanks for the invite. You and your blog community hae been a great source of inspiration. I was diagnosed with lung CA in 2005 Thanks to a fabulous holistic nutritionist, I have been eating raw, vegan diet for two years. It has been an awesome journey and it only keeps getting better and better.
I have made two trips to The Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center, once for Whole Person Healing, and once for Zero Point. Both amazing visits.
Kris, I loved your book and documentary. One phrase from your book that really hits home with me, is..."but it also takes a colossal leap of faith and a williness to break from the herd..." So true!
Thanks for all you do.
love, denise
Okay, okay, I feel officially welcomed. Thank you for that, Kris.
I just finished In Defense of Food. I definitely think we should all read it and discuss it. For me, a lot of it was preaching to the choir, but the research he cites, and the history of the nutrient-based diet, was fascinating to me. All this diet stuff gets so confusing, and he helped me to see why. (Marketing and money, duhhh.)
As for flavs, I agree with Callie. Just quietly delete them. I had no idea flavs had even posted this morning til I read something about it in someone else's post.
HI Kris!! Thanks for thinking of me!!!! :) big huge smiles on my face right now!
Well I'm all caught up on the posts and comments- i commented too..I've missed the blog! glad to be back! I've just been cleaning my house, and getting all that stuff done that seems to haunt me around the house "you need to get that done, this done.." etc. all that weird, annoying stuff I keep putting off- that just keeps nagging & irriating me...I'm the queen of procrastination- so slowly and surely all is getting either finished,cleaned,fixed,or thrown out. lol!
I'm so excited to see what your new web team is putting together! Anyway-Love you girl!!!
Hi,
I hope you don't receive a note from me twice. I wanted to say Hello to all and Thank you to Kris. This is a great place to visit. I appreciate all your hard work and your generous sharing. Do we need to do anything to join the back porch chat? I love your idea and think it will be great. Can I ask a question for those of you who have finished treatment? I finished 12/07 and now I am struggling with a severe depression. Almost daily all I do is hide with my head under the covers, I am not coping and find no inspiration to motivate to DO for myself and try to get out of my funk. Any suggestions or comments? thanks alot, violet!
Hi Kris! Thanks for the kind and open invite to this great community! I figured today should be the day I finally post after such a warm welcome! I also don't have cancer but have been there done that 6 years ago. At 31 I was dx'd with breast cancer, had a mastectomy, reconstruction, and 6 months of chemo. Never really gave a thought to what I was eating, or how I was thinking! After treatment was over I really began to look at all those things so I could get my health back and maintain it. I started juicing, and really looking at what I was putting into my body on a daily basis realizing that my diet and lifestyle (as well as the peeps in it) was toxic! I read your book, and you are an incredible inspiration to me on a daily basis! I met you back in the fall at the open center in nyc for a book signing and it was a day I will not soon forget! I am learning so much here to add to my daily lifestyle to make it better and keep the big "C" stay far far away. I recently had a scare with something that showed up on an MRI scan of my good boob and 2 weeks ago I had a followup to see what the little benign bugger was doing and it was GONE!! Which of course I attribute to all the juicing, meditation, and better food I am putting into my body. It is really the first time I had concrete proof that is is all working! Which of course my docs have no interest in and don't believe. You have such a wonderful community here and you all inspire me every time I stop by. Thanks Kris for todays blog, it gave me the little nudge I needed to step forward into this beautiful circle of the CSC community!
Lots of love and hugs,
Cathy
Thank you Kris!!!
Michelle
I'll be another one to come out of the closet, as it were, and admit to reading the blog almost daily but never posting myself. Thanks, Kris, for the welcome. I realized last night when I got home and was talking excitedly at dinner about Callie's news and my partner finally went, "Wait, who are these people you're talking about?" that I'd better sidle up to the table and introduce myself.
So, hello to all, and thanks for the warm welcome to the back porch. I've been following along, juicing since October, and finally transitioning to vegetarian and probably vegan slowly but surely. Have to share that I feel even more committed after having a flex sig scope done this week to check out my colon. I was having some gastro distress and even though I'm 31, I don't have access to family history so the doctor erred on the side of caution and did the scope. Since it's done without sedation, I had the chance to watch the whole thing on screen and have to say that it was sort of magical and made me fall completely in love with my colon. It was so intricate and beautiful and vibrant and I was completely amazed at what goes on in there, how much work it does and how much it deserves my ongoing TLC. Seriously, the experience made me only want to put things into my body that my colon will love and adore, and so I feel ever committed to a deeper learning about this lifestyle.
I also love me a book club, so count me in! I'll look forward to reading the first book.
Callie, congrats congrats! I've never been more nervous or excited for a complete stranger and I'm in awe of the idea of Basic Missions. Look forward to following along to see how it all grows and develops.
Be well, everyone!
*heather*
Oh My! I can not believe how many of you have been hiding out. Not that I don't understand. I was worried about posting too, but true to my nature (speaking before thinking....I hate that about me!) I just jumped in. I did finally confess to my worry of posting and Callie set my mind at ease. This blog is a godsend and I'm so happy we have so many new peeps today! WELCOME!!!!!
Callie - I do not want anything in return, you have already given me something that is not material, and means more to me than a million dollars. I just want to do something for you in return. Kris too. But just so you don't think I'm full of it, it will be a few months, because what I want to give you is going to take me some time to make. So please just let me do this. I love green too!
Jennifer
I adore the idea of a community altar. So much comfort (and power) can be found in having a village praying for you/ a loved one.
So glad to see our little village has some many friendly faces and hearts moving in! This is the place to live if you want to ooze sunshine.
Welcome everyone! Kris, i didn't mean to moan about our flavnoid person. I liked your post a while ago when you let them have it and told them to have a nice life. I suppose that is what we should do. Who knows what lurks behind the post? Maybe they're acutally reading this and getting inspired!
Nice to think so. I am glad we have so many new voices. Thanks, Callie for your prayers. I think you have a direct line, girl, and I already feel God cheering me on. No matter the outcome, it's about living.
Love!
Kris
You must tell Oprah & Dr.Oz the news!You know they'd love to hear this!Especially Dr. Oz and what better voice to be heard in the medical community than his.
Love,Peace & Great Vibes to all!
Linda
Muahh!
I'm always a lurker and never a poster! But you inspired me to post something - LOVE THIS SITE! I don't have cancer but I do live an eco-vegan lifestyle and love coming here for inspiration!
Hi all vintage and newbie posters!
What a wonderful thing to read about all the different curve balls life has thrown us all and how we are fielding them.. what a team we all are!
I am always telling people to come hear to join our community.. canser is certainly not a prerequisite for this course in miracles and love.
Cherish this moment as it is truely all you have..the past is gone and the future has not happened.. yet what you do this instant can make that future glow..
love to you all

Thanks to all of you townfolk for the warm welcome!
I think many of us "watchers" were inspired to write in for the first time to chime in our congrats to Callie and Kristy on their wonderful news. Your post, as usual Kris, comes at just the right time. It's so kind of all of you to welcome us with open hearts - I've even invited some friends to the back porch as well : ) Who couldn't use the wisdom, grace and love found on these pages in their lives??? I may not have the canser part (see- I even learned how to spell it right!) - but I've got the crazy and sexy DOWN !!!!
Love and peace to all- Monica
I've been following you for quite some time, but have never posted. I never considered myself a lurker because I am surrounded by family canSer (breast, lung, colon, brain leukemia, prostate), but I did feel guilty nevertheless. Your post of today remininded me that although my body doesn't have canSer, my LIFE is filled with it. And being human and all, I've got lots of challenges and can use all the inspiration your blog is so sweetly dripping with. So I would like to join the ranks of supporters you've created here to share and contribute to the collective love and peace fest!!
I have been so overcome with amazement at the strength by some of you that I couldn't be prouder or happier for your recent updates if you were my own sister/mother/best friend. So maybe some of my "behind the scenes" health and peace vibes found you all despite no actual posts?
To Kris and the Community at large,
Be Well,
Gabrielle
Kris,
Amazing truly...have been reading the blog always and have your Oprah on Tivo...watch it every now and then and today was one of them! Hugs to you all...

Hello Kris and new neighbors. Have been peeking over the fence for a couple of months now, but I decided this was the day to join in. I do not have cancer but had to make lifestyle changes a few years back.(autoimmune disorders were lurking)
Vegeterian now and juicing daily. Making the transition to raw and getting lots of inspiration from everyone here. Looking forward to picking up Michael Pollen's new book and sharing.

Kris -
I was just chopping some veggies for a soup I'm making, and I thought maybe it would be a good idea to add a recipe swap to the forum? I'm having a hard time coming up with different ways to fix veggies and I would love to hear some good recipes. Just a thought.

Going for genetic counseling on Monday the third, checking for BACA1 and BACA2. If this test is positive then prophylactic bilateral mastectomies.
Save the Tata wearers.
I am doing this to help my kids since they may need early detection.
About insurance...a possitive BRCA1 or 2 may eventually affect thier coverage and mine. Isn't that awful.
I was hoping to get done the way people do aids testing...in secret with #'s not names. I need to think about this one alittle.
I was just looking over "In the defense of food"...I'm so excited!
I feel like it will nourish my understanding of real food and help me continue to internalize why its vital to eat it and live off of it.
"In Defense of Food" is an excellent choice. He has another book he wrote that also would be a good choice "Omnivore's Dilemma." In my little town I dream of solar panels on every house and electric cars or bikes (in my ideal town, no vehicle needed--walk/bike everywhere), organic living with locally grown food, composting, ecofriendly/vegan products products only. We need to care for the planet and its beautiful creatures the way we care for ourselves. I can't wait for plastic bags to be a thing of th past. And water bottles are about the worst thing--so so many in landfills like the planet is a giant garbage can. I hope all here are inspired to use reuseable bags for the grocery store & dump the bottled water--buy a reusable bottle and a water filter for your sink. That's just one more part of healthy living.
Peace, love, veggies, and a green planet for all...
Live simply so others can simply live........
Just came across your blog recently and still reading back posts and I've already fallen in love with the community you have here. This post inspired me to come out of "lurkville" as I like to call it and send you a big HUG and a jolly CHEERS!
Glad to be here and ships ahoy! I'm definitely along for the ride and looking forward to all the things you've got coming up. I've been hearing so much about that book and as others have mentioned, seems to be a perfect time to pick it up!
I forgot to mention a pet in every household---may we treat them as beloved family members as they so deserve & bask in the unconditional love they provide. If you are interested, the local animal shelters have too many that need a good home :)
Are you sick of me yet?
Thanks, Kris for the open invite. I have been reading for a while and thought I would finally post. I have never blogged/posted before.
Love this site. Just bought your book. I think what I love the most is it makes me laugh. While going though chemo I tried to have a sense of humor about everything, and it really helped even on rough days. I have a PET scan next week and if all goes well (and I think it will, I feel great) I will be 5 years cancer free, dare I say "cured"?
Going though treatment I was never comfortable about support groups, but after chemo, I moved out of state, away from my family and the only life I had ever known. So I never really connected with people my age who have had similar experiences, fears etc., It is nice to have this site and all you wonderful people. needless to say my nothing in my BC life is the same as my AC life. And I could not be more happy. I got maried 3 months ago, Trying to start a family. And living as happy as I know how. Thanks for all the insipation and I'm sure you will all be hearing more from me more often.

If your looking for a cancer killing cowboy kris... I maybe for hire! : )
I posted once or twice. I have no canSer - just autoimmune stuff! I originally posted under "Becky" without realizing that there was already one here!! OOPs - I'll use Becky B - Colorado from now on to distinguish myself! Thanks everyone for the positive feedback to my "lack of support from family" dilema. And guess what??? I bought my first juicer and I'm ready to rock! AND....I'm going in for Colon hydrotherapy Friday am!!! Can't wait to start cleaning out this polluted vessel and filling 'er up with the good stuff!!
I love you all and will pray for our little community!!
Kris,
one minute I'm compelled to come out of the shadows as a "reader, not a poster" due to your insightful commentary on your vision of what death might be like....now I feel compelled to thank you for giving me the phrase "Flavs is a maniac with issues in the tissues"......why do I consistently read a canSer blog when I’m in generally good health?.....whether you realize it or not.....this blog is already about more then CanSer.
I would welcome any of the activities/contributions you mentioned. I've mentioned before that while I'm not ill, my life has been touched by CanSer...I lost my boss to lung cancer last January. He was close to retirement, and I'm 36....but we still had a lot of fun going to lunch together and talking about work, life, women....my lack of women....you get the point.
When he became ill....well, this was a man who had “been there, done that”....and he was a tough old guy. An old news director from NYC….you can picture him a little I’m sure. Discussions about his lung cancer were generally off limits....but his wisdom, combined with his current perspective made for some very interesting conversation.....needless to say, I miss those lunches.
So for a long drawn out response...I would love to hear this groups views on politics, family, current state of affairs....anything....you all have a unique perspective that is a wonderful gift to share.
Michael
Great blog! I drop in now and again. My incredible wife & I are holistically healing my body of rectal cancer. An enormous process and an extraordinary journey. I regularly blog my experience as well as my passion for life and the gifts this cancer provides at:
Stop by when you get a chance. Thanks for your contribution to us all!
Bert Scholl
How beautiful to see so many new people throwing open their "closet" doors to step into the room!!! It has become an amazing place to come to each day, meet new friends and learn so much. I so look forward to jumping on and jumping in to listen, chat, love, support and share life.
Kris, tomorrow is my one-year canserversary (I love the phrase, hope you don't mind if I borrow it!). My kids are dancing with me now (its the only time I'll let my 9 year old son say, Mom - shake your ass!) So, I'm totally up for the ipod sharing, love the book club idea, and the electric altar...so awesome...Dr. Bav is up there now, she must feel the love! Clint, so ready for more of your wisdom and wit and hot guest blog spot - bring it all on!
xo Sherry
Kris -- you're wonderful! I bet you never hear that ;)
I will have to admit that sometimes I delete my posts cuz I'm afraid I said something silly.
I love this town sooo much! So glad to be a part of it. I will keep posting even if I'm sometimes silly.
Well, I'm another long time reader who has never posted. Like some of the others, I don't have canser, although my mom did. I just had open heart surgery myself, at age 23, and I've found all of the posts and comments very inspiring as I've been going through recovery. The book club, forum, song lists, recipes, etc. all sound great to me! Thank you for sharing your stories and for setting up such a welcoming community!
Oops, can I add a P.S.?? I have medical forum question, a poll I need to take to get some serious knowledgable answers to because I'm on the heebie-jeebie, superstition fence here. So Kris, if you'd rather I wait til your forum is up I will, but need some info before mid-March. Please give me a thumbs up or down....thanks
Hey Sherry:
Congratulations on your 1 year anniversary.
Am glad you can "shake your ass" with your kiddies !!
:-)
nice to hear from you,
Clint
hey I just found a adult class in town in March for 25.00 to learn raw food . I hope you all could find one, as a newbie to raw this sounds good.
What a wonderful welcome! I have been reading for a long time but never posted as I felt I didn't fit the Cancer criteria. I love all the ideas you have and would love to be part of your community. I just started taking Mildfullness classes and striving to live for the moment and really live for NOW and not worry about tomorrow. I dig you mission and consider myself moved into your town as the newest residence.
Hi Everybody,
I admit it too....Guilty as charged.
I have been visiting this blog since I saw your show on TLC then I got the book (by the way, how do you do it all Kris, Show was awesome and book really touched my heart with fine humor and even the blogs are super cool)
well, I really admire your attitude, talent, courage, Positive energy, humor and best of all the magnet personality.
your positivity is really contagious and spreading the world
Fortunately, I am not aware of having canSer. My older child has very severe multiple food allergies
which has changed my life. I really appreciate you all and the knowledge that all of you have and must admit that I learn so much from you all.
Thank you again very much Kris for sharing your knowledge and positivity with us every day.
Good Luck to all of you.
Iffat
No, Granola...not sick of you. I think many of us have this dream.
We all just need to move to the same place and DO all this stuff.
Granola -
I started recycling about a month ago. It was my new years resollution. My recycling bins are busting at the seems right now, I need to take them to the recycling station. I can't believe how much stuff I have that can be recycled, and feel really really good that I didn't send it to the land fill. Oprah did a Going Green show and that is what got me started. Thank god for Oprah! I love the animal shelters too. My last kitty "Jack" who I just lost, came from our local shelter and he was such a great cat. I will probably get another when I'm ready, from the shelter. I just hate going there and leaving without taking them all with me. Especially the dogs. They just seem so scarred and sad.

Pre-surgery week insomnia.
Kris, I was wondering if you have ever thought of a healing package? I don't want to give you more work but a thought. I don't read much when I am really ill and I can't even go on the computer. I shot my TV, except for DVDs'. So I thought it would be nice for a book on CD read by your loving posse, they could read their own parts or a pro could depending on schudules and stuff. It would have healing music, and deep relaxation section all done by the best. Just a thought at 4:30am.
mary aka mhc
It is so hard to get your mind to turn off when you are worried about something. Especially something like surgery. I'm sure everything will go well and I'm sending you peacefull healing vibes. I've been struggling with insomnea myself. Not sleeping has a chain reaction on your health and mental state, and you need to be really strong for your surgery, so do whatever you need to do. Baths, Chamomile tea, soothing music. I think taking a supplement called melatonin helps you sleep too, but you should research that. We are here for you.
Jennifer
Hi Kris, thank you from one of your new Philips fans. I am no hippie (but could be). You helped me connect with some feelings that will help me deal with an adult daughter in distress. With love, some would call me "big daddy". You can too.
Jennifer and mary aka mhc -
Prior to a major surgery, my sweet baby sister sent me a wonderful CD - "Preparing for Surgery: Guided Imagery Exercises for Relaxation and Accelerated Healing". It's available on amazon.com. I had never done any kind of meditation and I found it extremely helpful. I even used it some nights post-surgery, when I was in pain and couldn't sleep.
Just a suggestion for you : ) Hope it helps - as well as so many lifting you in prayer at our electronic altar.
xoxo Mo
Hello Loves,
Kris Don't worry about the flavoids folks if we love the enough they will get guilty and go away.
Wow so much is going on today. We have two Becky's so.... Becky with scans today... You are on my every fifteen minute major prayer list and my breath prayer list. Peace be in you with you and around you. Duncan explains God as being enveloped in a warm bath of love and just floating there. That is this blog and we are holding you tight so you will not fall.
Becky B. and all the newbies.. welcome and please stay.. this is great. It is such a powerful thing to form a community and make positive changes in your lives well before you stump a toe much less get canser or any disease. I am becoming more convinced than ever that these foods and this method is the cure for all disease stored in the sanskrit writings we have been looking for forever.. the Askian tablets from Alexander the greats hiding places. All religious scholars have heard of them but not all beleive. I do..
Duncan has ALS- Lou Gehrigs disease from a virus he caught as a special ops in the military. Well he had his check up this month and that little auto-immune bugger is failing. He dropped 500 points in his trygl., has a chol. of 130 and for a man who was completely wheelchair bound, and had HAD diabetes.. He can now walk almost a mile. Has no diabetes and had very few seizures as a matter of fact he hasn't had one this month. That is down from 6 a day..
Dr. Bav clued me in to lots of nutrition books and we flew with this program. Precious heart that she is. By the way Bav if your reading the cancer dead paperwork has converted my brother in law.. hahaha We did it God did it... just a little time.. the proof is in the vegan pudding. haha..
Gooney.. you honor me.. I accept and cannot wait to see your face at the retreat in april 2009. Save up everyone.. I have paid for the building. Beds for forty bathroooms handicap accessible and the beach.. private bayhouse.. all you have to do is drive into Mobile and we will pool grocery money. I cannot wait.. this is for everyone.. bring the kids dont.. whatever.. just come.
Cathy we are having miracles by the day doll you are the third. WHOWOOOOOHOOO!
Clint- we are all in love with you secretly you know that. Congrads and celebrate.. Duncan and I are dancing the happy dance for you. Hurrah!
Capi's wife You are doing great and an inspiration. Keep on posting woman.
Mary I have Eat, Love Pray on my ipod it is so calming. I know surgery is scary, you will feel so much better after it is done. You are on my 15 minute list bigtime...too. I think the healing pack is a beautiful idea. We should make one up and have a rotation on sending it around. So if I have a book, cd and relaxing items... I send them to say Mary for her surgery, next person on surgery list gets sent it then the next.. then all the love and notes and energy gets there along with the book, cd, and whatever you wanted to add. Then again if Kris wants to sell one.. that would be great too.
Well guys.. I have a prayer request I have a family with a child that has acute lymphatic leukemia and is sick,,,, the Mom is frantic because she is about to loss everything we have gotten the heat turned back on but for only 25 days and they need to go home.. and wont.. so pray for them.. They cannot foot this huge bill and keep their son and daughter in heat or food and they are insured. It is just a mess.. We will work it out but adding a dash of prayers and a pinch of love wont hurt.
Kris.. I love the book.. and cannot wait for the discussion.
Off to work. I needed a break.. Sorry this is so long. Love you all... prayers are also with Tae always.. and poopslinger stay around more.. your name makes me smile and your words touch my heart.
Peace, Love and Veggies.. Duncan is joining our little group... that will be so nice.. he feels like he knows everyone and has kept up everyday.. and guess what.. He can spell..
Becky check in asap and let us know how you are from the scans and martha... how are you today? I am praying for you.. don't all will be fine. Hugs. Callie
I haven't posted in ages. 2008 has been a rough year for me. That being said - I'm certain not as awful as it has been for others or could be. But I've come to realize that it's ok to admit that you're going through hard stuff, even though someone else may be going through something you see as "harder". It's still happening to you and it's still something you have to deal with.
Anyway - My partner and I broke up JUST before New Years, I hurt my back on New Years day - which meant I couldn't work out and I'm still slowly working back into being active. I love running so that's been hard. And of course dealing with the break up. We lived together all January until he found a place he could move into (today). Other little things that just seem to add up when you're aleady dealing with something hard.
Let's just say I lived off ice cream and cookies for a bit there. Hopefully I'll get back on track with the healthy here. I know it'll make me feel better but I really just didn't care.
So with all this I just haven't been around online. I'm not certain how I'll handle Feb as I think that's when things will really hit home as I'll be living by myself. Anyway, thanks for the reminder that we're all just a great community here no matter what our health or state in life.
PS: I got the PH Miracle book for xmas (ironically from my now ex-bf.) and am starting to read that and am hoping to follow up with some detoxing once I get back to a routine and am a bit more 'myself'.
Aw welcome to everyone! Especially you newbies who don't have canser and for one reason or another, felt they didn't fit in. EVERYONE fits in here, that's what makes this group so awesome.
Goony- I totally agree with the recycling sentiment. Once people educate themselves and really realize just HOW MUCH of every single thing you buy, purchase, use, touch, whatever, can be recycled, you'll find your recycling bin basically overflowing every week (mine does, it's almost got a life of it's own, honest, I named him George). I highly recommend every one take the time to educate themselves and learn about what can be recycled, why it can be recycled, and where you can take it in your area. Oh! And bring your own grocery bags! Lots of grocery stores, most actually, now offer you a discount if you bring your own bags and not to mention it helps eliminate TONS of waste. It's a win win.
Hello to Kris and all the other folks in this wonderful GOD sent community. I tell you I had to stop crying before I try typing and posting again.
I am just getting the hang of get’n around using things on this blog, seems I erase everything at least once during trying to post. I’m getting it tho……..just slow.
Kris I am so proud of you, you have seen your path clearly and you are following your journey of love. I feel that love all of us feel that love. LOVE is something that makes the world go round, it is love from the heart in sharing and caring like you and all of us here, sharing and caring what a little thing to have such a BIG effect.
I love all of your ideas! I will check Michael Pollan's latest book out. I am really aware of our food problems, and that it is a MAJOR problem and needs to be dealt with. It is so very important to get involved in buying local grown food, support local and you will be supporting your good health. BUY ORGANIC!
I would like to share a little of what I have been dealing with as far as having insurance or the lack of. I live in the state of Oregon and for the first time in several years the state is opening up a lottery for 10,000 people in the state to get a basic health care plan. For one month they will except applications, then pick the lucky ones from a drawing………
I hope I’m one of the lucky ones, my nurse practitioner then tells me he could do more to help me if I can get it.
BOY I can not tell you how that made me feel, knowing if I had money or insurance I could get help, this health care only available to folks with lots of money or good insurance something has to be done. A lot of folks in this country are suffering because of this.
Your book and documentary have made me feel like ok I can do this or give it a dang good run for what energy I have left, I still have fight, I’ve been spunky, I got gumshion, I can do this ! Now I have this WONDERFUL COMMUNITY! I hope I will have something to share. I’m good at sharing my heart. Having all of you to share with is helping immensely.
Plus I’m having to use the dictionary and reading more than I ever have, and I’m typing with 91/2 fingers…………..not so bad.
My LOVE and thanks to ALL.
Laura
Kris, Thanks for the welcome. I have read your book, seen your movie and I try to read your blog almost everyday. I personally do not have cancer, but am surrounded by it. My husband had kidney cancer 2 years ago, my mother had breast cancer a year ago, best friend had skin cancer, co-works, other family members. I so enjoy how upbeat and uplifting you are. I have learned so much from reading your book and watching your movie. You are inspiring, as well as all the other women (and men) who are apart of the Canser community. Thank you, each and everyone of you are a blessing.
Hello Kris & Others-
Great blog! This is only the second one I've read, so I'm not even a lurker yet, but I did LOVE the TLC movie and saw you on Oprah too. So inspiring.
I have bookmarked this back porch. I'll need to go back and figure out why you spell it CanSer. I've battled 3 different types of CSC myself. First dx was 13 years ago at age 22. It is a part of me but does not define me. I am always looking for ways to prevent #4 and continuously improve my lifestyle through nutrition, exercise, meditation. Sounds like this town just may help with all that and more!
Sorry about all the deleted comments. Too sleepy. thanks everyone for the borrowed courage.
My firewall can go down now and be call....Mary
flavonoid dude go advertise some where else, you have made a pest of your self and you dont even talk you just take space with your adds, please stop or at least come out with some words so you fit in.
advertising is not sharing and that is what this is all about.
your like a high pressure salesman, in other words fast eddy and his suitcase company, speak up or leave gracefully. Thanks very much for the info on flavonoids!
Hello Again!
I want to go raw but I don't know where to start!! I am a vegan right now and I want to make my diet 60-70 percent raw. Any ideas on where I should start? I have a juicer and a blender.. I make a smoothie for breakfast every morning of frozen fruit, ginger, a banana and hemp or almond milk. I am not sure if those milks are considered raw? And I don't know what I should eat the rest of the day. Can someone help me!! :) Thanks so much!! I love this community! P.S. Today is my 24th birthday (hence the urge for change!) Thanks again!
Lauren N.
Are you guys getting spam mail now?
Lauren N- I highly recommend the following books for newbies (besides Kris' gorgeousnesss!)
The Raw Food Detox Diet (this book has specific stages and levels, and is one of the best books I've come across)
The Raw Gourmet (fantastic, fantastic, fantastic)
Welcome to the world! If you have any questions or need any help don't hesitate to ask!
Thank You Dee,
I have a book by David Klein.. I have crohns disease and his book says a vegan raw diet is best for that, so I am going to re-read that as well. I will check those other books out too. Thank you so much!!
Lauren N
Hi all:
Re Mary's question about spam. I haven't gotten any yet. And you can probably put flavonoids on your list of blocked words on your spam filter. It won't help our town, but it will at least keep your personal mailbox litter free.
I wonder if this person is using some kind of web crawler that just automatically finds blog communities talking about cancer. So he/she may not even know about this community and the effect he/she is having. (Except, now that I think of it, "this blog does not allow anonymous comments." So somewhere along the line, a human being in the Netherlands has to be paying attention to this. If only to type in the gobbledy-gook in the word verification box below.)
Anyway, on to bigger/better subjects! Looking forward to reading Michael Pollan!
Jamie: We have missed you...I know you will get back on the csc bus as soon as you are feeling in the groove. Falling off the horse is ok... just got to get back on!
Bav: Thinking of you, keeping you in my prayers. Post and let us know what we can do to help.

Love your ideas, where do you find all of them???
Goony,
Thanks for chiming in about recycling and animal shelters. I am so sorry for the loss of your beloved Jack! I understand how greatly devasting that is. My pets are family.
In continuation of our discussion, I think a healthy planet leads to healthy inhabitants. We need a healthy planet to grow healthy food, so we can eat organic/raw and not worry that our "raw organic" food is grown in soil polluted by runoff from a landfill or junkyard.
I love this community. I think everyone here is open to making this planet healthier in our own pursuits of personal health. Compassion for others also is key. We are blessed to be living in this country. As I type, the atrocities in Darfur continue. This is purely unacceptable. It is overwhelming to think of the troubles in this world caused by humans. We can help. Even if every person does just one thing to make this world a better place, it will add up. Recycling, green living, donate time, money, or items to a chosen charity. Reach out to someone. Educate people.
Kris & fellow bloggers--Thank you all for a creating a forum for such discussions!
Just read today's news--2 mentally retarded women used to strap remote control bombs to, detonated in Baghdad pet bazaars--73 people killed.
Unimaginable. It has to stop.
Ilike the idea of passing a healing package around. Sounds like positive vibes.
On a quick note: My daugther explained to me about hacking. White hat: Police or FBI theyprevent hackers from hacking into personal information. Grey Hat: someone who hacks for fun and pranks. Practical jokers. Black Hat: are people who try to shut down web site or blogs through hacking. I will put that word in my spam folder now. This will be the last time I mention it, because of the high the guy is getting over this site. Poooor sad person.
Callie:
You are too cute....
I love that with Life's big load that you carry, you are SO strong still to reach out to other people.
It gives me a warm fuzzy on Steroids that your dancing again !

I need a major immunity boost! I think I'm sick cuz I slacked off a bit on my raw diet, but I'm not sure. I've started working with kids again, which always end up getting me sick. It's pretty frustrating because my future plans will have me working with children in hospitals. I am always going to be working with kids, so I don't want to keep getting sick. Back when I was 19 I worked full-time at a daycare for a year and was sick every other week. seriously. I know that's supposed to happen, but I thought I would've built up an immunity toward the end of the year. Nope! And I'm always washing my hands.
What do I do? Today I drank lots of juice, and ate salad to give my body a break. I'm hoping that along with affirmations of "I will be over this tomorrow" will help.
But does anybody have any other suggestions?
Now on a side note, this is an example of the kind of post I would delete because it's a little whiny :)
Kris--
Thank you for all that you do for our sweet community. Me, I'm living la vida loca with all my canc and non-canc friends...one breath, one moment at a time.
om, om, om
Lauren,
Ester-C. That works for me. I think you will like it. Some people like "airborne"--it is like an alka seltzer tablet. But it is herbs and can interfere if you are taking a prescription med. Let us know if you try it.
Lauren~ this works amazingly for me- hope it will do the same for you- (if you are on a blood thinner-or have a condition that warrants risks of thinner blood then don't do this because oregano oil and garlic oil are natural blood thinners..(and actually most herbs are blood thinners, some can be taken, some cannot, alot of which can be taken with caution even if you got thin blood issues-talk to your doctor etc.)also disclaimer lol I'm not a doctor, this is just what I do for me and it works great.
I take Ester C 1pill 3x a day(its a form of vitamin c that's way easier for your body to digest), the huge thing is- Oil of Oregano! its a natural antibiotic that kicks major butt! with out the gross side effects of an 'prescribed antiboitics' lol. I get mine from gnc- in a tincture and I take 10 drops in morning and 2-10 drops at night depending on how I feel. (you can try just a few drops of oil at first of the oregano just to make sure your body is ok with it, because 10 drops is a lot at first-my body is used to it etc.)then I take 4 garlic oil pills (another kick butt natural antibiotic) 2 in the morning, 2 at night...take the garlic with the oregano oil..the oregano oil helps combat the the garlic odor breath lol! oregano works like a parsley in that it gets rid of odor -it really works-but don't take the garlic 'powder'pills or the garlic odorless pill, they are useless- it needs to be the actually oil of garlic for full effect..anyway, then i don't drink any coffee, but drink alot of antioxidant tea,lemon tea,echineacha tea,and i don't exercise while I'm fighting a cold/sick...conserve your energy and let your body heal...anyway i kill off a cold almost immediately doing this routine. Also as a side note oregano oil as an awesome natural anit-inflammatory and works great for pain. even arthritis etc. (my cousin has a bad knee and she takes 5 drops of oregano oil a day and it keeps all the pain away lol ...before the oregano oil she used to take IB brophen everyday, then switch to naproxen , and just go back and for for years..now she takes nothing except for the oregano oil.)
Lauren~ oh! and don't forget to be taking your whole food multi vitamins everyday.
Lauren~ oh yeah maybe you can also take some Flavonoids! NOT! lol
granola~
my friend did you get my comment on the other (final party)post yesterday? thanks for thinking of me! :)
I cant believe that crazy sad story about those women! that's just horrific!
I love how you are all about animal rescue! :) all my crazy lovely pets are rescues over the years :) 6 starving stray rescue cats, a rescue Labrador from a kill shelter, and an unwanted sweet lovebird lol...I got me a zoo here- but I love and adore them all!
Hey gang...I think we should probably stop using the "F" word, just in case this is on some automated system that's looking for likely forums. The more the word is used, the more likely the automated system might feel (if systems can feel)that CSC Town is a good place to set up shop.
lol your right! I think I egged it on that time oops LOL, sorry kris!
I am very calm, sitting by my community...then a phone call. Come in Monday for one more invasive test before surgery. I said "No" it is my body, and I am tired of the invasiveness of testing.
All day I have had an vision on my mind. All of us sitting on a huge wrap around, white porch, cream yellow house. Chatting over lemonade and granola bars. Mixing and making sure everyone feel welcomed. Fresh fruit slice laying on platters. A fresh veggie bar taking customized orders according to illness or health needs. Canser free children flying balloons.
Waiting to hear about Becky's scan . . .
Feeling lousy myself today. Have had stomach issues all week (related to Aunt Flo--for some reason, sometimes I bloat all up and my belly hurts for several days, like it's full of gas) and although yesterday was pretty good, I didn't eat a lot and last night had a glass of wine. Woke up with a headache and a hungover stomach. Going to go high raw the rest of the weekend, lots of juicing, no sugar or alcohol, and see if I can get back on track. Been into the sugar a bit this week, too, and that doesn't help.
In fact, I'm ready to rethink this "fruit til noon" thing I've been doing a la Natalia Rose. Because I don't have canSer, I didn't see a big reason not to do it, but I dunno that it makes me feel that good. But a green juice at 7:30 isn't enough to get me through the morning without getting lightheaded and woozy by 9:30. Anyone got any great ideas for raw breakfast that's not fruit and not another juice?
Mary, we crossed in cyberspace. Of course you said no to the new invasive test! Isn't surgery enough?!
I love your image of the house with the porch. I also see tall green limeades, straight from the juicer . . .
Thank you SO much apmonkey!!
You're too funny. Maybe I will try the "f" word.
Ya know, we now have a new obscene "f" word. Cool right? I'm gonna use it instead of the other obscene "f" word whenever I'm frustrated.
Hey there,
I was sitting in a MRI scanner on a couple of occasions in the past couple weeks and it gave me lots of time to think of all the wonderful people on this blog. I love the energy.
I don't have cancer myself though my neuro brought it up 3 times during my last meeting (and that I should still consylt with a GP because it all isn't his specialty)...insane I think....but he just wants me to take care of myself and be aware of what's going on in this wild and wonderful body of mine ("as there are so many so many slow growing things out there we have to be vigilant") so with that I join the group.
Lauren....The oregano oil is great. I also use it to stop colds in their tracks. A couple of drops under the tongue every few hours. I usually do this for two days. Pump up the probiotics and drink plenty of yummy green tea.
Be well,
Joy
Hello everyone.
Basic Me, thank you, you put a smile on my face today. I finally found a community I want to be a part of. I look forward to posting, reading and getting to know all of you.
found out today my bosses wife has canser, so the first thing I did after work was buy her a copy of Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips. I hope she enjoys it as much as I have.
I wil be thinking of all of you, stay positive!!!
Holla to Poopslinger!
Love reading your posts! Way cool re: rescued animals. You are awesome! Also, never heard of the oil of oregano--I am definately going to try it! And yes, I did read your post on the last blog :)
Lauren--love your pic-cat sleeping on coat hangers.
Laura--No health ins? BIG problem in this country! Can't imagine you have to win the lottery--even then, no guarantee of coverage!
That reminds me, did anyone find this buried story (check cbs.com, business)
Exxon Mobil Corp. on Friday posted the largest annual profit by a U.S. company - $40.6 billion
HMMMM.......
Kris, thanks for including everyone on your blog. I was so moved by your documentary and all the research you have done. I do not have cancer and I don't want to wait until I have it to get myself in optimal health. Thanks for giving us the tools to do that. I've been passionate about nutrition for years because of some health problems, but you're my kick in the butt to take it to the next level! I never thought to do wheatgrass shots or green shakes, now I love them...thanks! I'm even going to go to the Institute for Integrative Nutrition to spread the love and help others. I hope we can join forces to make a difference in the lives of many (of course, you've already done that!).
Thanks so much for your inspiration! See you in Charleston!
Good luck to everyone out there recovering...you are amazing!
Anne,
I love Natalia Rose's book too and have been trying to keep up with the level three menu but, like you, I get lightheaded in the morning if I only green juice, then fruit, so I've ventured out to this Ani's Raw food kitchen which I've found some good recipes in.
You can actually watch the video on youtube and she guides you through the process. It was quite tasty.
Here's the link:
Good luck!
Thanks, hard to stand up to people in white when you feel vulnerable. Good I am wearing my "she is trouble" pjs to the hospital.
I know about the fruit in the morning. I have been cheating and using brown rice to help me. I have to keep my strength up for surgery. don't want to do to much to soon.
As for pet rescue: Save a 10# dog.
Anne,
Oops!, I forgot to mention what the breakfast was on the youtube video link that I posted: it's a nut based "scramble" (almonds, sunflower seeds and more) that looks kind of like eggs in the end, served over baby spinach. I ate it for breakfast and it kept me very full.
Sarah.
Forgot: I
too felt the cyperspace connection. It was spiritual.
On the white coats part, I must say that...Hey since we are in the neighborhood....and we could take that ??? growth out too.
Just Tooooo Much!!!
I have something to keep me busy. Two of my friends: one her dad needing prayer alhymerzes. The other, after one year marriage on the rocks.
I guess I don't have time to go quietly insane.
One of my babies sisters who battle a aggressive form of breast canser set up a spa day for me before surgery. God bless the girl.
Hi All,
I truly appreciate each and every one of you and I would like you to know that.
I admire this community and definitely want to be part of it- i may not believe colonics have enough evidence to back it's benefit up but I am trying to keep an open mind and would not discourage someone in my practice from doing it,if there is no potential harm.
your words and your support on this blog give me great comfort. your desire for a strong healthy happy life can be contagious-esp when one is exhausted and forgets all about that.Your genuine support for each other reminds me of the good in this world and your honesty is refreshing.
I have lost a friend to cancer because of someone like the flavaperson, who sells false hopes.often i wonder if i listened then to her hopes of what macrobiotic can do and suggest ot her it is a great idea if she would combine it with chemo.instead i told her i did not believe there is any evidence this alone would work .I deeply regret not having an open mind then and tuning in to her holistic quest.Maybe if i have listened to her she would have listened to me in return and have gave her self a chance of recovery with another round of chemo after recurrence of her ovarian tumor.Instead she risked her life with a herbalist that claimed he had the cure! I am bitter ,sad and angry when i think of her. your community helps my healing process.I admire and respect your intelligent approach in the combination of modern and alternative med and not choosing one over the other.I am now a strong believer in the importance of promoting the integrative approach in my region,esp when silly voices similar to the flavo person are unopposed.The logical combination of two schools is the answer and you do not underestimate the person own power in the recovery process.(vs beleiveing it is all the meds/procedure.etc)
To me sexy crazy cancer the documentary , the book and the community.Is about all what Kris mentioned in this post . in all honesty I thank Kris for giving us a wake up call! to remind us through her story to push the pause button and re-evaluate what truly matters.It is also a chance to heal open wounds and not ignore them.
have a great weekend everyone
Reem
sorry about grammer/spelling errors in my post
macrobiotic =macrobiotic diet
YAY!!! I'd love for that to be the first book ... it just so happens I bought that at B&N just the other week. Sounds very interesting. My life has taken some remarkable turns since becoming a part of this community. I have learned a great deal about life, health, strength and the power of love. This community is such a beautiful and bountiful source of energy that is available for anyone and everyone to tap into --- hop on the bandwagon! YEEHAW! ;)
Because so many people think I am ridiculous to eat a vegan and/or raw diet it would be great if Crazy Sexy Cancer helped us find each other by location...so if we choose to we could meet away from the computer. We could also form Crazy Sexy Cancer Lifestyle Groups.
I live in New York's Hudson Valley.
Thank you so much for the invitation, Kris. I've always visited your blog for inspiration, and your special brand of humour. Now I'll feel free to post. It's always fun to be new in town and to meet a community of diverse people. Yours is so very welcoming and enriching.
light, love, peace + joy,
Di
Good morning family,
Since is is a favorite topic on this blog and I need to be "moved", I'm going to ask for your experiences and ideas.
Poo. I haven't in days and I have been stuffing as much fiber into me that I'm starting to feel like a cornucopia. Still, nothing. Combining foods properly (most of the time...dinner in my down fall), juicing every day, drinking tons of water. What gives?
Hey Kris,
I am a subscriber to Natural Health magazine and every month they send me an email asking me to vote on which cover I like better. Today they sent me the one you are on!! I had to choose between the one you are on and another cover with a model on it.. of course, I chose your cover!! Yay! Can't wait to get this issue!!!
Tae...go buy a fleet enema, fill it with pure water or add some wheat grass...after a few tries at it you will feel lighter and not so stopped up.
Sorry, it works!
deb
Tae -
Do you take a probiotic? I take one everynight before bed and it keeps things moving along.
Jennifer
Reem -
You can't take responsibility for your friends passing. That is just not fair to you or her. You were being a good friend to her and giving her the best advice that you had. Maybe another approach would have worked, maybe it wouldn't. She would not want you to be feeling guilty. I am watching my father-in-law pass from cancer right now, and I hope I can follow my own advice. Not because I'm trying to talk him out of this way of fighting cancer, but because I can't talk him into it. He just won't eat vegetables. I'm trying to make peace with the fact that it is his life and he needs to do what he feels is right for him. The best we can do is be supportive and wrap them in a blanket of love.
Jennifer
Good Morning all! So good to be back and no longer a lurker! It is nice to have a warm community to come to share, learn from, and inspire. Callie, thanks for shout out! And I must say that I have never been so excited for someone I didn't know! Although I feel like I have come to know you through reading this blog. I am so very happy for your good news!! You must feel amazing girl! You rock! And what an inspiration you are!
My dad was diagnosed in April with pancreatic cancer. He had a successful surgery, although he opted not to do the chemo they recommended for him. The doc said 8-12 months without doing the chemo. But who knows. Unfortunately he is not into this kind of stuff. Our relationship is not a close one but I still try to tell him about all the great things that I am doing for my health. It is so frustrating and sad for me to know that he doesn't seem to want to do anything to get well. I know all of this would help....I so believe it. But I guess you can't make someone else see it. I guess it is that part of me that just wants to save him. I know that I can't but the little girl inside me still wants to try....
Thanks Kris for such a wonderful inspiring place you have created!
Hugs to all,
Cathy :)
Reem..I am so sorry. What an awful feeling when we think we have let someone down. Then they are gone...how can we do our the patch up work with the dead?
I too have had a close mind. I am being tested for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer has a small survival rate. 20% even after all the chemo and surgery. No guarantees. So diet, exercise ect will give me an extra edge.
Do you know I can't find one ovarian support group in town. Their just mostly breast. Most ovarians don't survive even with the best tx. Because it goes to you colon next and so on.It was a blessing to see in CSC to ovarian canser beaters.
I saw what chemo has done to other family members. Not pretty. Canser tx can leave you with PTSD. A second and third round would be hard to do. Emotionally, physically or spiritually.
Also, sometimes white coats give no hope, So what is a person with canser to do to feel a little power: diet exercise, vitamins, boosting the immune system is all we may have. It gives us hope, control and sense of powerful;over a somewhat powerless foe. I truly hurt for you. Hope you can find a way to make peace with yourself. Your friend I know is in a better place. Like my cousin Stevie who died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after he refused a second dose of chemo. I tried to save him. Puny me. try to save him. He had made his decision and had peace with it. I supported him, I supported him in something I knew was wrong..
Good Morning Everyone. Can you believe it is Saturday. What a week.
M.h.c.- if you need to call someone at 3 am and need a voice call... honey.. I hate the hospital as you all know. Anyone here is a line. I am here and will certainly listen..251-648-6510. You may have to leave one message and I will call back asap. I truely believe that you did the right thing. Here is the way I think about it. If we do not say no to the medical establishment sometimes we feel so powerless. My oncologist knows I need time to think over what will be done to me. He threw a lung and lymph node biopsy in on me and we went 9 rounds. You can always go back for that or have it later if needed. Take your time it is your body. How are you? I hope all is better today and you can hear the birds singing and the sunshining. Almost over darlin' I am holding your hand thru cyberspace.
Becky-I am holding my breath waiting on your to check it. I know all went well. But I am still praying and sending you all the ggod vibes I cam thing of.
OH Anyone who needs an ear just call.
Sherry... shake it baby shake it!!! Congrads my gorgeous friend. WHOOO hoooo.. what a land mark.
Jamie february is going to be your month darling. You home will be your own private canyon ranch spa. Perfect foods prepared for you on your on fav. dishes crack out the china and crytal. Long baths with new books and spa pedis and mani on demand. You get control of the click and can sleep in the middle of the bed. Dont worry about the cookies and the choc. all of us need a holiday and you had one.. just get on the good food horse and your feelings will sore. Make them die over the bod... summer is coming and feeling good and being in the sunshine will make life seem like it is perfect. I am sorry you have gone thru all of this. Sometimes God just clears our paths becaue he has something sooo much better in mind for us.. eve though we cant see it.. Just wait miracles are coming. And be ready and lovely from loving your self for a while.
Laura... I am going to give you a beatin' no... call me asap.. this is what I do honey.. get meds and treatment for folks who dont have insurance and help them get on some insurance. And we might be able to lobby a bit and get you on that plan. GO TO basicmissions.com and write me and call that number. Now dont worry if you dont want to.. that is cool too. But seriously I may be able to help. It is worth a try. If nothing else we can get the meds paid for for a year and that can give you some relief and some good care.
lauren you are ahead of the game. Look in the back of Kris' book and there is a list of healing food books . Go to Debbie does raw who posts here web page.. she is amazing..on the foodie stuff
Anne- eat.. honey..you will die on wone green smoothie in the a.m. find something on the diet. Saute greens and warm tofu or miso soup is so good in the morning although watch the soy.
Reem- I know the fear that goes with the colonics.. But honey if I may be a nut. But Kris said I will would feel better so I did it and am doing it. Enemas and all and by gingo it works.. Gets those toxic particles out of your body. Take it slow. Start with the enemas.
Oh and on the subject of getting things out of us.. aloe is amazing.. Duncan takes a lot of meds for pain and that causes things to pile up.. so this has helped him so much. One Tablespoon of aloevera each morning and voila.. working like clockwork.. we both are. Now that the diet is in full swing the problem goes away unless under stress.. Tae honey you are under stress.. add some aloe and relax .. walking helps to.mobility = motility. shake is baby. I hope all is well with you.
OK.. ladies.. spread the word about basicmissions.com being able to help on the health care end.. and medicaid and disablity and extra food stamps if you need them to help with the high cost of eating green and 80/20 it can be expensive while sick. I am not saying I can help everyone but I do this all day so if you guys need me you go to the front of the list your my family.
Clint.. hugs.. I am dancing today on my new leg and singing all day at the top of my lungs I kissed the dragon!!! I cannot wait to read your post.
Duncan sends his love. It will be a hard day for him today. The mail didn't bring his prescriptions and his morphine should have arrived. Life.. so we may be biting the bullet today. But with all the blessings we have had.. he is happy.. and he is superman.. he would never ask for prayers but hey.. you know me..
OH and Kris' you can add askimet to your site. I think it is a download.. you can open it to approve all bloggers except some with the parameters your put up.. just words or phrases.. It works great. Duncan wanted you to know that and you don't have to approve each message. Ask your web people about that.. if you want. OK.. Love you all. Sorry this is long. I have been missing you guys ...
Jennifer my love.. you are inspirational... gooney is one of my favorite wordss... it means precious.
Peace love and veggies.
Callie
Welcome all new lurkers! WOW, WOW, WOW. Come out come out where ever you are. This is great! Couple O' things before the next post (which by the way will be by my Crazy Sexy hubby - yup, he too is a lurker who really wants to chat now.
Granola - you bring up very import issues so I must officially elect you to the town counsil. True empowerment is a result of fierce activism. Couch potatos don't make leaders. So funny you mentioned the exxon earnings. I have been physically ill this week especially when I read an article in my local paper about people being forced to give up, abandon, or euthanize their pets because they can no longer pay for the feed due to the high price of oil and gasoline. But hey, Go Exxon!
When we start to take better care of ourselves we shift our consciousness, we push away the fog and notice our precious green earth turning brown. If we mess that up then where will we get the nutritious veggies so needed for our alkalinity? The distorted and vicious power we have over the weakest members of our global community (especially our animal pals) creates a devasting pollution that is both spirit and physical. "Give it to me now, use it once and throw it out, I'm rich and I'm all about me so screw you." Hmmm, very immature don't ya think?
This is such an important time in our countries history. Who will we elect? 100 more years of occupation and suffering in Iraq or a new regime with hopefully some new ideas and a few apologies? And how about some frickin' healthcare! I'm sick of lining the pockets of the drug companies, how about you? How did we come to live in a country where doctors are forced to ask the permission of corporations? Hmmm.
PS. Republicans and Democrats are BOTH welcome in our town. This isn't about further isolation, it's about an honest conversation so that we can all make choices from an informed place.
Cancer is an inner global warming, our flowing rivers turn stagnant and our terrain wilts - depleted and barren. As we clean up so must we clean up the world around us. Recycle, reuse and conserve. It feels so good to make a difference. go granola! Keep the chat going love.
On another note, we all walk our own paths, we can preach and praise all we want but we can't pull the flower to force it to grow. we can't absorb the burden of changing a man/woman. Bottom line: The only time we can truly change a person is when they are in diapers! Change is a personal revelation/revolution. The light bulb switch is located on the inside of the individual challenged to wake up.
Let go of the guilt and the frustration. When I was a macrobiotic nobody could tell me that I wouldn't be cured from rice. NOBODY! I had to find out on my own, to carve my own path. Some folks will never believe in the power the body has to heal itself. Bless them. Some folks truly believe that western medicine is the devil. Bless them. Our truth in this town is that we must remain open to both as we educate ourselves and take responibilty for what we can.
To answer a few other questions:
Yes, we will have a location on either the forum or the new site where you can list your location and create an actual meet up support group! Recipes too.
Tae: In a pinch you can also try Solaray's Cal/Mag Citrate 1:1 ratio. I take 6 before bed when needed and yes, a probiotic too. I think you are just stressed and holding for obvious reasons.
To everyone waiting for test results this week: Breathe.....right now, breathe......The town will rally around you. No matter what you hear, you have a home and a place here.
Ok, off to the dump to recycle, then Brian and I are going to the bookstore to get started on the book club selection. Maybe the gym too. yuck. More soon....
I was feeling lousy since the two day detox. So because it is before next weeks events. I am going slower. I was having the worst headaches and sugar cravings. Lot of fruit here to help that. Pre-diabetic...so I do you balance sugar and the lightness in the brain. Udo Oil?
Melons for not pooing.
Dearest Mary ,thank you for you words and as a white coat I would like to share something with you,SCIENCE IS NOT COMPLETE AND STUDIES ARE NOT PERFECT. What you were told about if you take 100 women with ovarian ca and follow them post chemo for 5 years, around 25 will be disease free after 5 yrs is true.However remember this is a mixed bag it is the 80 yr old woman with 20 yr old assumed to be the same.the aggressive tumor with the less aggressive.The main problem is not the aggressiveness of the tumor but th late diagnosis.PLEASE DO Not LET any number affect your spirits.when the test results are back you will know where you stand and will deal with it then-we are here for you .. to share the joy of knowing the results are negative and to support you if they are not.
you are not alone.
Regarding chemo I think the perception of some people of it is worse than actually going through it.when I worked in the oncology floor and rotations some people had the biggest optimism and greatest strength-one of my friend's reasons to turn away from chemo is her fear from hair loss as it happened the first time around. I see women defy CanSer by refusing to be affected by that .. not only they wear the nicest scarves and hats one even went on to designing her own lounge collection ( where PJ and matching head pieces - oh and did i tell you she lived way beyond the months we white coats expected- she is one hell of a woman ,still alive after 6 yrs :) from meeting her, she meeds maintanance chemo every 3 weeks..)In other words you are thinking of the dark side of chemo, but even my friend was canSer free after chemo for some time and she would have gone to remission again if she gave herself that chance.Chemo can silence a cancer and all the tools you mention diet,healthy lifestyle ..etc can help someone through the process and better prepare them for the journey.
MARY ,I HAVE ONE REQUEST please listen to a number quoted as a percentage of cure or whatever and remember no one person is a number
the number is just a POSSIBILITY.the more i work the more i believe it.
Regarding support groups , there are a few online and one on facebook.I reached out to them when my friend made her mind and one of the ladies was nice enough to e-mail my friend and share her story which was similar.She also mentioned her mother who also had the tumor failed natural remedies alone and was combining the two treatments.
I googled ovarian cancer and had many groups. all i joined at that time but cannot remember which exact one Holy was from.
Thank you gain for your support and you know i mean it when I say we are really here for you if you ever need us.
Jennifer..thank you for your words ..the blanket of love is where is hurts . bcs we had a huge fight when she made her choice .. i told her she had no right to be suicidal and the argument went own .. we did not talk for a yr before her death after 20 yrs of friendship.this is one of the things i am trying to come to peace with.
all the best veryone
Love
Reem
Forgetful me. On the subject of poo. This is quite inate...when a person is losing a lot...they hold onto a lot. It happened to me and hubby when we were with abuela.
reem, thank you for the reassurance. I feel better now.
Cathy,
My husband also has pancreatic cancer & had succesful surgery, but he is doing the chemo. None of his doctors ever talked about time with us, thank God. I feel that with his treatments and by following a healthy lifestyle & diet he will be fine. All we can do is give it our all. I'm sorry your father doesn't want to do anything right now, but pancreatic cancer doesn't have a good outcome, maybe he just wants to enjoy the rest of his life without the side effects of the chemo. Maybe he will change his mind, but that is something only he can decide.
Hi All,
Wow, what a group!
I, too, have been disgusted by Exxon. Until we all do our part, these huge oil companies are going to suck up way too much money. When I walk here, I usually go through a park that has lots of games going on on the weekends. I counted in one row, 15 out of the 16 cars are huge SUV's. Also, lots of Hummers down here. I'm not saying if you own an SUV you're an awful person, but in Scottsdale AZ you really don't need one! I've driven a Prius for 5 years & people always ask me, does it have enough "pick up". If I was racing in the Indy 500, I'd have to say no. The car is great. The newer ones get better mileage, mine gets about 46 miles per gallon, I guess the new ones can get up to 60!
Before this car I had a VW Beetle, so I guess I am a hippie! (LOts of people will comment on my striped pants I wear, I can't help it, I'm addicted to stripes!) Not exactly professional wear for a pharmacist, but I wear the toned down ones when I'm working.
Callie, can you have Duncan's Dr. or an Urgent Care clinic write him a couple day Rx to get him through?
Kris, going to check out Pollan's book today on my long walk can cut past the book store. Good ideas you have for future topics.
My best to all. Sue
To Mary and all others who need a ray of hope and a liter of support STAT!
For support go to Daily Strength.. it is an online community... you will also get tons of support from give it to me raw.com another online community.. I have a group I lead called cancer survivors..come join us! Lots of hope there..
On the subject of HOPE.. the best four letter word next to LOVE:)
I am listening to a book on tape that is AMAZING and it is written by a hemo/onc dr...read it, listen to it.. just get it... It should be on your hit list right after Kris' CSC.. you need it in your arsenal people.
It is called 'THE ANATOMY OF HOPE'.. and it is freakin amazing to hear all the case histories, including oncs that came down with the very same diseases they treat...their responses will suprise and enlighten you. The author is Jerome Groopman.. I am sure the library has it.
Hope is so important, it is all we have, it is what Kris gives us, Callie, Tae, Goony, Bav, Jennifer, Lauren, Cllint, Micheal, they all give it to us.. we need it like we need oxygen. Hold onto the hope, never let it go.. it will be your miracle drug.
love you all

Come Vist Me!
Tae- There's been SO many good suggestions for you, and while you say you've been drinking loads of water, anytime I'm 'backed up' I try to drink more than 1 gallon a day. Yes, it sounds like a lot, but it does your body good!! Besides that, I agree with everything everyone else said, Aloe Vera Juice and Probiotics are a God send but so are yoga, walking, Tai Chi and swimming. The more you stress about the 'no flow' zone, the more likely it is the 'no flow' zone will be out of business for quite awhile. As difficult as it may be, flood yourself with liquids, and give yourself a break! It's like anything else, the more you focus and harp/worry about it, the more likely it won't happen just because of the stress etc. A watched pot never boils you know? A watched colon never poops! It just has stage fright!
Reem,
Guilt is never a rational thing; it distorts all the faculties of the human mind, it perverts them, it leaves a person no longer in the full use of his reason, it puts him into confusion.
by: Edmond Burke
You were in a very emotional state of mind and made some decisions that you would never have done so otherwise. You were terrified of losing your friend. Now you punnish yourself because you think you need to suffer. The truth is that you made those decisions out of love and your friend knows this. She wouldn't want you to carry around so much pain and guilt because it will make you sick. Guilt is toxic. I don't want to make this about me, but trust that I know exactly what you are gonig through. I punished myself for a long time, and did end up getting sick. Your friend loves you and wants you to live a long, happy, healthy life. I'm sending you healing vibes today.
Jennifer
MHC -
First I'd like to remind you that the studies done on the women with ovarian cancer were probably not done on CSC women who are healing their boddies with nutrition! So forget any numbers they have given you. You are not a part of that. Keep fighting with greens girl!
Secondly, I have to tell you I love your big wrap around porch and pale yellow house. It happens to be on my bucket list. I daydream of a house like that all the time. I can taste the lemonade.......mmmm!
Calming, healing vibes coming your way!

Hey Kris,
I see what you are saying and agree with it.however from that experience and the sense of failure.. comes the drive to build the Arabic health information network.to help people make educated choices.like her herbalists , the voices that sell dreams need to have a loud counter voice to say"this what we know ,and you have that option of using the best of BOTH worlds"
The web site i showed you is just one of the tools we will use,current URL is a demo ( talked some colleagues into it) .I am now trying securing the funds for it as it will be a sponsored project.when it comes to medical and health conditions it is very important ,i believe, for people to have resources in their own language.I will definitely keep you posted and everyone else here. you because I want your voice to be heard in another part of the world .it can make a difference. why share this with everyone else here, this is the happier ending I want to my story/smile .and It will happen,Godwilling.my intended launch date is late 08.
for the health educators here,I found out from the pharmacists what they use when we consult them regarding drug/herbal interaction
i find the monographs complete .
other people here may find it beneficial, however it is only safe to use something after you talked to someone who understands your overall condition.
hell i am beginning to sound like i am at work! .. sorry guys
going for some green tea and veggie shopping
Jennifer I appreciate every word you said and will keep it in mind, i agree with you ..i am trying t change the negative feelings to a positive energy..trying and will succeed but it is not easy as u know.Thank you !
have a great day everyone
Callie -
SHUT UP!!! Are you serious?! I had no idea that is what gooney meant. I just love the movie (goonies). My license plate even says goony (someone already took goonie). My favorite line is Goonies never say die! I love the whole message of that movie. Now I can smile more knowing it means precious!!!
Jennifer
Jennifer! That movie is MADE.OF.AWESOME. While I agree with what you said, I love that it means something sweeter (goony) I have to admit I too was thinking 'BUT DOWN HERE IS OUR TIME! OUR TIME!' and then going off on that big speech in my head. I know all of it by heart, I must have seen that movie at least 45 times. I was obsessed when I was little.
Dee !
Yes, Yes, our time! LOL!! I was 12 when I first saw it. It was during the summer and I was spending a month with my grandparents. I watched that movie probably every day that month! Then about a year ago I bought it on DVD and now my children are hooked too.
Jennifer
Kris -
Amen sister! I watched Oprah's show on recycling and going green and it made me a believer. There was a woman on the show that reminded me that just because the garbage men take our garbage way, doesn't mean it really goes away, it just goes someplace else. I went out the next day and bought 4 bins to put paper/plastic/metal/glass into.
Please to go to find a recycling center in your area. It is right at the top of the page, just enter your zip code. It is simple! I found bins at sears.com for $9.00 a piece that stack, and have a flap that opens up on the top. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
Jennifer
Hi all:
Did you notice the post from our friend in the Netherlands asking who is removing his/her posts? The gall amazes me so much I have to grin at it. If this person was so eager to be a member of the town, he/she would have picked up on the string that maybe a billboard might not be the best way to say, "Howdy neighbor."
Now that we're on to movies, I see from Mary's own blog that she's a big fan of You Can't Take It With You. I LOVE that movie! The first time I ever went into a theater in a bad mood and came out in a great mood was when I saw that movie at an art house showing classic Jimmy Stewart films.
I'd also like to recommend Joe Versus the Volcano (don't run me out of town! the popular opinion is that it's a terrible movie but it's brilliant! And it's all about fear and embracing life) and Defending Your Life
Re Pets: There's a fantastic story in today's NY Times about a no-kill sanctuary in Kanab, UT, which is taking care of Michael Vick's pit bulls. (Talk about "immature," heh Kris? Imagine someone explaining his brutality as immaturity, which is what Vick did)
Anyway, the reason why I bring this story up right now is that the dedication of the people who work at that sanctuary is profound. And, what I do for a living is write about people who love their work.
Work, like exercise and nutrition, feeds the soul. And people who are in the wrong jobs are putting themselves at risk for soul cancer. But people who are in the jobs who are right for them can really change the world!!
This is my special cause in life: Restoring hope and bringing work wisdom to people so that their health in this aspect of their lives is robust.
If you know of anyone who deeply loves their work, will you let me know about them? And if you want a pdf of my first book, Find Your Calling, Love Your Life, let me know and I'll send it to you.
Hoping this didn't sound like a commercial, it's just my passion and I wanted to share it. Especially since we're talking animal rights and politics. The joy of work is also an essential topic to health living!
I just love you guys and am totally hooked on Our Town.
Speaking of pets, my oldest friend sent me this link. Evidently it's one of those sites where the more you click, the more money is donated to animal welfare organizations. This one seems to be legit (I tend to be pretty cynical about those "click to give" type sites)
WOW this is getting better and better.
Hello to ALL and thank you!!
Jenny, I am in So. Oregon a bit far from you but maybe there are others out this way that want to hook up.
Tae good luck! And it sounds like things should get moving soon with all the great info you are getting. After my surgery the drugs put me in the same place your in. After a month I had to do colonics. I was great…..and the relief.
The thing I have to remember is to chew chew and then chew some more. Before cancer I would put the food in my mouth pop a few holes in it and swallow, chewing my food well helps me.
Boy isn’t it funny how the smallest things in life can have such a BIG impact, chewing, deep breathing, and laughing.
I love it!
MHC I am right there with you, I have been looking for lung cancer survivors, seems there are not many around. I did not want the chemo either.
My hospital experience was a nightmare, GOD was with me this one day when I asked what the nurse was giving me in my drugged stupor, she said its something the Dr ordered I asked what and then told her I never heard of the stuff and I didn’t want the shots, she insisted and I told my son don’t let her give that to me, thank GOD my son stood up and told her to leave and get the Dr right now. It was the wrong meds and would have been lethal. I have PTSD also.
I know how you feel when you say having some power over this, eating the right food, exercising, going within and being still doing these things is giving me some power in choices I can make.
Callie thanks so much for reaching out, and everybody else too. I put your number in my phone and would love to call and chat, I am afraid I wouldn’t be able to stop crying right now but there will be a time, I will try basicmissions.com and send you a letter also.
Thanks again to all and my very best to all.
Laura
treat cancer~
Seriously, you are hilarious and annoying all at the same time. Who are you?? Why do you think you can treat cancer with your product? I have been to your site several times and all you are selling is nothing more than what a few fruits and vegetables can do...whats so special about your vitamin c? whats so special about your flavonoids? and I'm honestly asking you theses questions, not to be sarcastic... if I can get the same amount of flavonoids by eating some oranges and blueberries right now- why bother buying your product? who have you cured from cancer?
Martha- I COMPLETELY agree. That's why I not only work (and am horribly in love with what I do) but I also volunteer. My volunteer work, is what makes me feel like...me. That's the only way to describe it. The work I've done in South Africa, Haiti, Egypt, Pakistan, Korea and especially here in the States, is the most meaningful thing in the world. Of course the world travels are on hold thanks to the wonderful c but it's still very much in the plan to get back ASAP! For now however, volunteering includes lots of ASPCA, RAINN and mentoring, as well as helping in food kitchens as much as grad school (WOO HARVARD YAY) and work allows. Sure I may be 'overdoing' it or 'pushing' myself, but I love what I do and I'd never give it up for ANYTHING in the world, let alone something like canSer. Mmm mm, no way honey.
And LOL @ Joe Vs. The Volcano!!
Listen well...
I'm not selling any product. Flavonoids (quercetin) are very cheap and they are sold in vitamin stores. This mix is in theory a 100% cure for cancer. I can't make any guarantees ofcourse. Yes you can eat flavonoids by eating fruits, but you would need to eat about 500 apples to obtain the amount of flavonoids that is from supplements.
This is like a new treatment protocol. Hopefully it will wipe out all cancer cells.
No You Listen "treat cancer".. If you are a real person with a real cure WHY do you spam this site like an a**hole????
We are an open minded holistic type community but your tactics have made your site a sure failure with us.
Wish you would "come out of the fl. closet" and be a real person who we might learn from.
There.. I feel better.
Well done Debbie!!! I've been tempted to write this guy an email off-blog but then I thought, "who am I to speak for the whole group?" even though I'm pretty sure I'd be spot on, as they say.
So snaps to the Debster!
The only person not invited here is back? I'm telling Clint,lol
Peace,
Linda
Hey martha
Thanks for the snaps! fyi to you all: you cannot contact 'treat".. the email address does not work.
Hence the frustration level of us all at not being able to directly tell him what is what.. and yes, it is a him.
Come out come out wherever you are "treat".. we welcome a real person, if you can stand to be real.
deb
Kris: Here's a topic I'd love to see you explore...Debbie's reaction to TC brings it to mind -- The Fighting Spirit. First of all TC's advice to "listen well" made me want to hurl (can we say "arrogant?" I knew you could) and Debbie's response, "no you listen" made me want to hurrah!
A moment in your film that really struck me was when you expressed your rage, and I'm wondering what the impact is on us all when we feel like we have to endure beautifully (like Darryl Hannah repeatedly said in Steel Magnolias: "Freeze beautifully") like doing anything *beautifully* shows that we're in command of the situation -- sailing through any situation like Queen Elizabeth -- what *is* in her purse anyway?
Reading "listen well" pushes the same button that gets pushed when I hear "what you need to understand is"...that just sends me into orbit . And it brings out the warrior princess in me.
None of us can endure beautifully like Ali MacGraw did in Love Story. Especially when we're being talked down to. Or told to be good children and just take our meds because Drs orders only to discover a close-call mix-up, like what happened to Laura.
While nothing makes me feel less attractive than a full-fledged "mad-on," I then think who says we have to be attractive all the time? I say, let your rage flag fly.
Hi Kris,
Thanks for the warm welcome and encouragement to share. I would like to pursue an educational program in alternative healing/nutrition/detox methods discussed here, in your documentary, and in your book. I find myself struggling to explain the new choices I have made, to become a healthier and happy person, while talking to friends and family. I would also like to pursue these topics in my writing with a deeper understanding of their inner workings. Any suggestions?
Thank you:)
I heard my name leenda, and I came.....
DO NOT Make me open up a Can of SPROUTS on you !! . . . or it'll be Wheatgrass Shots at 20 paces
;-)
Hello everyone! Miss you guys. I've been busy so I haven't been able to keep up with the conversations going on.
Just wanted to let you all know I'm thinking of you.
Hope everyone has fun on superbowl sunday and super tuesday!!
Speaking of lurkers, I've been wondering what happened to Librarymom?? Are you lurking? Hope you're well!
Martha and Debbie: You go girls! let those rage flags fly. Rage to my = passion and it is better to let it out then to stuff and force it to marinate into disease. You think the moments I showed in the film were real? OH NO! The moments on the cutting room floor were the ones that include flying plates and tear tornados! And let me tell you, I did not look very "pretty" - i looked HOT to trott! LOL! Real women, with real feelings and real emotions and reactions rule!
Now Steven Chang AKA Flavs. Dear, we really appreciate your efforts to help us with all your research. How about you be respectful and kind and let this community simmer down a bit. Hon, you have a good heart and you mean well but your tactics are backfiring. Post as yourself, hang out, cut the flavs push and then we'll all welcome you.
Gang, lets get back on track and move forward with grace, think Jackie O. I check the blog 2-4 times daily (if I'm not on the road) I'll just keep deleting if this problem continues. So ignore and just scroll down for now. Soon we'll have a secure place with membership. I wish I could move faster!
Sundari - love, the kind of education found in this blog comes from self education. I got my holistic health educator certification at the Hippocrates Health Institute in West Palm Beach. I have also studied at The Tree of Life. I think they have a masters program. Most if not all of what you need you can and will find on your own. Traditional schools often push traditional out dated information on nutrition and wellness. hang with us, you'll learn aan awful lot. xox K
Oh good Kris and Clint to the rescue!!!
Poor guy,he'll never win,plus so much to learn here.Hope he takes advantage of that.
Peace,
Linda
He said 20 shots of wheatgrass,that cracks me up.
Hi all,
I've never blogged before but this site is so wonderful. I'm a two year survivor of breast cancer and am so glad to find you.
Thanks for all the great support and information Kris. I loved your book.
Kris, sounds like you are very busy. On the road alot. Take good care of your immune system. Take your techno breaks also. As for the rest...just let it go. I raged the other night. I was just tired. A lot of stress. I keep asking myself what can I learn from this experience. What can I teach from this experience.
Sorry Clint I slaughtered your funny,was laughing too hard.My bad.
Peace,
Linda
Thank you for the invitation to the porch! I stumbled across your site just a couple of weeks ago and have been sharing it with my many loved ones who have been affected by cancer. I don't have cancer but in the past year it seems that my whole life has been altered by it. Both my husband's parents have been diagnosed with cancer in the past year. They are both in their late 50s. And my dear friend and business partner was diagnosed with lung cancer in April and just passed away on December 11th at age 39. Kris, your comment about the power of the mind and why one person makes it and another doesn't really hit home for us. Of all three of my loved ones diagnosed last year, my mother-in-law's prognosis was the gravest. She has pancreatic cancer. We just celebrated her one year cancerversary (thanks for the term Kris!). Her cancer has not grown or spread. Out of the three, she has been the only one doing a lot of integrative healing - naturopathic treatments, she's completely overhauled her diet and has been doing intense spiritual and emotional work, primarily N.E.T. - neuro emotional technique. She held off on chemo because her oncologist said it would give her a mere few extra weeks as her cancer was inoperable. Her response was "whoopdeefuckingdo!". She set out on her own journey of healing and has an incredible, invincible attitude. After many months of intense naturopathic treatment, it became clear the cancer wasn't spreading as predicted so she started chemo in the summer. We are so grateful that the cancer seems to be in check and hope that it continues. I just wanted to share that hope with anyone out there with a seemingly hopeless prognosis. I know my family and I thrive on stories of hope and encouragement. I send you all love and prayers.

Hey Gang,
No notes this evening. Just wanted to chime in on a few things. I think as humans we all have a call. I also beleive that Through our experiences all of us dicern our calls in life. I love my life. I love my job. I have had so many. But this is my passion. Now what really pisses me off is that daily... many many times daily I am contacted by men and women who are dog sick and cannt find medical care, food or meds. There are children out there going to bed without heat because their parents had to buy medicene. And milk.. Although we all know that milk is bad.. and causes all kinds of mucus and yuk.. most american families with children buy milk daily. Now just think if milk here is 5.69 a gallon then men and women are working one hour minus taxes for less than a gallon of milk. We are in a war that sends our vets home with inadequate care and they show up on my mission steps just needing a hand up.. tools to work with or a way to get thier meds.. because the va is so backlogged. Unless you were special ops or an officer ..
tangent.. the mail ran late and why the universe is blessing us so much I have no idea but Duncans meds came and voila the worries are over. He is feeling much better and having his granola snack before we have our salad.. He has done some shopping therapy today and has enjoyed himself immensly. I confess my husband is a shop aholic. haha Anyway.. I am so grateful and so please. Yes his dr. would have written a short term med.. he just didn't want to bother them.. Thanks for the prayers
Anyway..I am lost now. I got my limited brain off the subject.
Like all of you I am so into recycling. I am so tired of plastic bottles.. come on.. those are my pet peeve.. how many can you use in day.. It is redundant. And exxon dont even go their. haha
Clint.. I would love to see the kickass sprouts.
Well I have to head off just wanted to chime in. I am programing a computer for a gift from the mission to a young client.
I am looking forward to the new book. I bought it today but haven't started it yet.
We need to begin to build a few homegrown co-ops.. find organic produce and purchase in bulk.. if you have friends on this think about it. My friend and I are saving tons by purchasing thru the farmers market or the growers. It took me awhile to find the right people but if you have a group in your area. Think about it most farmers markets have organics and will let anyone buy they just have to get the case ... so save the packaging and split the cases up between several friends.. Much cheaper and saves on gas and the hunting and fetching fresh things al week. Just a thought.
Well. I am off to spend some quality time with dear old duncan and he sends his love and blessings. Callie
ps sue got your notes thanks for visitng the site. it is getting a major over haul this week. Neat stuff coming. You touched my heart so much and thanks for the congrads.. love you all.
I am glad Duncan recieved his meds. I get migraines and have to keep norco in the house. When I am out, I am out.
Checking out you profiles= alot of nice people in this small world.
More milatant shopping today...chocolate robe to go with my leopard slippers and lime green pjs. I am really going outside my color spectrum. And it feels great.
MY hubby bought me a AMD notebook to take to hospital. Now just to sneak it in.
As for bulk Pollans site has local coops and farms.
Well hello my crazy sexy friends! It is nice to be back. I recently made a trip back to the Farber in Boston and officially graduated from having to back there every 3 months to every SIX! I don't have to go back until July! Woo-Hoo! Tomorrow morning I am off on a litte get-away with my husband to San Fran.....should be a blast. I am really looking forward to it!
One of my biggest pet-peeves is the ones who seem to know-it-all and have the end all cure. If there was an end-all cure-all none-of-us, with or without cancer, would be here, trusting and embracing this so special community. I had people tell me if I did certain things that I would be cured of cancer and spared chemo etc. I was not going to gamble on my life that way. I have way to much to live for. Sure, I will listen to research and listen to claims with evidence, and be very open to innovative nutrition and alternative healing, but to claim that one product can cure cancer is just plain and simply ignorant and disrespectful to ALL of us here. I really love this blog and it does keep me focused and grounded in so many ways. Hang tough group! Thanks for your continued open and loving thoughts. Kris has started something extremely powerful and I am very proud to be part of it. Lets not let ignorance ruin that for us.
Kris, one of my best friends, Jill, makes jewelry, specifically spirit-locks. She told me that someone met your parents at a wedding and gave them one to give to you. Did you receive it? Jill really wants you to have one. She made me one when I was diagnosed and I really don't take it off. It may sound silly but it was made with such love and I know it keeps my healthy spirits in and wipes out the bad. The spirit locks are from Thailand and the story behind it is that when one gets sick there spirit has gone a-stray. The spirit lock keeps the good spirits in and rids the bad. Before cancer I wouldn't have believed it, but now I feel naked without it and can really feel the power behind it. My sisters wear the same one as me and it keeps us all bonded. Holding on to something like that is so powerful. I hope you received it and I hope it can bring you as much strength and good spirits as it does me.
XOXO
Laura
Hello amazing people!
I haven't posted in a while... Hope you're all doing good. I am still cancer-free (YAY!!!!!)
I am living like I mean it, as Kris says, moving a lot, rediscovering the amazing machine that is the human body. Give it love and veggies and it'll be happy!
Sending you lots of love from snowy Montreal.
Sophie
Oh, I forgot, I registered to the Weekend to End Breast Cancer, walking 60K in 2 days this summer. I have to raise $2000, I'm aiming for way more!
I am bribing friends into walking with me, promising them a pink FUCK CANCER tank top if they join...!
Anyone else walking for the cause?
Sophie... again!
Here is a company out of eastern oregon, they deliver way out in to iowa, minnesota, n&s dakota, nebraska,montana, wyoming and all of the west n&s.
I have bey doing business with these good folks for decades, they have a great choice of organics and tons of it. check out there web site and policies. they deliver once a month and they are very honorable folks.this place is great for neighborhood coops, they deliver right to your door if you are on there route, 400.00 min. order. i have a group of folks that buy as a group, pick up at a drop off point. take a look!
my best to you all

Hi,
We just came back from an appointment from a Microbiotic Counseller and read your post Kris. Guys please tell me can Brown rice really be the cure of all inflammation (in our case Allergies).
it would be great to hear, what you think about Microbiotic especailly Kris if you could please tell me.
Thank you guys
Tomorrow I am going for shopping for the microbiotic way of life.
would be waiting for your responses.
Thanks you all
Iffat
Not to worry leenda !
(I knew what you meant ;-)
Our Crazy Sexy Cowgirl handled the situation with pure class.
Clint
Callie:
Love your posts, your a blessing sweetie.... you have a heart as BIG as Texas !
. . . and you don't wanna see the 20 paces thing, it can get messy. Hope 'Flavor Flavs' got the message.
:-)
Clint
Good night all. My md gave me ativan and some ambien cr...sleep, sweet sleep to all.
Drinking lots of fluids to flush them out (the meds). With CHF I have to stick to a 1 liter of fresh, agua purificada.Much love to everyones hearts. Mary.
Igrade - Hi honey and welcome. First of all, are you cutting all the gluten out of your diet? How about dairy? Are you juicing green drinks? Are you cleansing your colon? Perhaps a good probiotic and some aloe will help you. Like anything new, it takes time to adjust to the GF diet. It is natural to mourn old food habits for a short time. Stay focused on all the foods you can eat. Yes, attitude is everything. Remember food is fuel, we need to change our attachment to it, find new joy in activities, spirituality, movies, walks, fun, joy, friends, books etc. Sometimes I feel like I need AA for chow! It's hard but it can be done, all you need to do is to change your mind. Stop yourself in your negative thought tracks and reprogram a smile. Remember, your mind is a radio station. What is your DJ playing love? Go grab a spiritual book and dive into it when you feel weak.
Iffat - Healing is never one size fits all. Every person has a special path. That said, for me, macrobiotics did not work. It was a great place to start because it got me off the standard american diet. But long term (and I did it strictly for 2 solid years) it left me depleted. Raw foods is far superior for all the reasons we talk about on this blog. When you cook food above 118 degrees you kill the enzymes and deplete the vitamins and minerals. Macrobiotics doesn't advise anything raw, no supplements, no water, it is a grain based diet that can be very acidic. I can't agree with this approach. But that is my personal opinion. Others find it very helpful. You must decide on your own.
Alraight, I won't write that much about flavonoids anymore. Only sometimes but you won't notice it that much.
Reem I read your profile. Are you really going back war? I am so proud of you. Willing to go as a physcian. Though I do feel sorry for you too. But I know you will help out a lot of people. I will be praying for you. A best friend always lays down his life for another friend. You are laying down your life for strangers...I respect that.
Callie=tried to leave you a email through your profile. I failed. I am to shy to call.
A question for the community. I am taking a big risk here. I having a hard time being romantic with hubby. I am to into myself I think. Did anyone else feel this way when they were waiting for DX.
Iffat,
As Kris stated everyone has to find out what's best for them. I've heard macrobiotic for Celiac, however I think most important is anti-inflammatory, so decrease or eliminate all animal products is most important. How about combining macrobiotic with raw if you're not comfortable going all out with one or the other. It's hard to go 100% raw. If you'd like, you could try raw until dinner & then macrobiotic in the evening. Just a thought.
Keep reading, experimenting & listen to your body. Kris knows her stuff. As she said, it may be different for you as you have a different condition you're dealing with. This is a great place to start!
Sue
Thanks Kris for your encouragement. Yes, I have eliminated all gluten and dairy and am juicing. My doc's say this is a long, slow process. Right now I will focus on being more positive. Be well.
Iffat
I wanted to suggest taking 'Turmeric' (yes, the spice) for the anti-inflammatory issue. This root is an amazing fighter against anything that's inflamed. I am surprised it's not spoken about more.
I take 2 capsules of it 2x's a day, it's harmless, and doesn't bother digestion.
Also, MSM (the sulphur mineral) would help you condition tons.
I am in agreement with Kris . . . . Macrobiotics, is a good place to start...but... I did notice early on that there were a lot of pale, anemic people walking around the community, and they were assuming that they were all fine and well, when in fact, they needed vitamin and mineral supplementation.
I was told by a counselor early on, to take supplements (and I did) and decided not to become one of the "macro-neurotic" crowd, and eat plates of brown rice everyday.
Listen to you body, it is ALWAYS right....and is speaking to you....one just needs to listen.
hope this helps,
Clint
Clint, you kill me. Flavor Flave?! You are even down with the pop culture references! And your RespectKris messages are still making me laugh. Callie is right, we all have a secret crush. Our boy is smart, funny, health-conscious...and ladies wait 'til you see a picture of him all growed up...handsome as George Clooney, our Clint! Dude, are you single? 'Cause my best friend is awfully cool...I'm kidding. Mostly. You are in Texas and she is in NYC. Otherwise, I might be trying to play Yenta.
I'm SO happy to meet all of the new posters! Special shout out to DUNCAN!! How wonderful to hear from you! (You're welcome about the coconut oil.) ;)
And welcome to my sweet sister Monica, who is hilariously shy about posting (not shy at all in real life). She was so worried about me when our dad died and wanted so badly to help. We were at her home in Michigan and she had friends and church peeps constantly stopping by, bringing food and comfort. Since I haven't lived there for years, it appeared that I was alone in my grief. But I told her how much support I was receving from this amazing blog community. So, she eventually checked it out and got hooked herself! Monica was on Oprah, too, by the way, the same show that I was on.
I am so grateful for this group of cyber friends. It really is amazing how much you can come to care about people you've never met in person. When I read Callie's news, I spontaneously said to my husband "my friend Callie is cancer free!" He said "have I met her?" "No," I said, "but neither have I!"
lgrade, try using the words "I am in the process of___" as you are learning to change your thoughts to more positive ones. "I am in the process of healing my body, mind, and spirit." "I am in the process of turning my negative thoughts into positive ones."
Praying for you, Beth/Bav. Check in, please.
Holisticgal Jen, are you ever coming back?
And Lori the librarymom, where'd ya go?
Love to all y'all, esp my sistress!
Sandra
Hey Mary
I found that after dx my love life was hard for me...there is a part of us I think that goes inside and hides a bit..I tried "fake it till you make it"...my hubby has been paitent. Try not to shut yourself off from him..maybe talk about it and change the way you function in that area ie: maybe you need a foot massage first or just a cuddle some nights or an open ear to listen to your struggles.
He needs you too...maybe listen to how he feels about all this stuff..sometimes I think men deal with hard feelings through sex-trying to feel better. Clint? is that true?
Love is magic...but it takes a bit of negotiation sometimes.
hope that helps a tiny bit and remember Mary you are a warrior queen and you need your soldiers with you in this fight!
deb
PS clint I started on MSM crystals.. tumeric is next..I am supplement shy I think:)
Deb
Yes, there definitely was a suspension in the love life area for me, as there was a lot of healing going on in different levels of myself (Mind, Body, Spirit)
For me, my body basically went thru an emotional 'Colonic on Steroids' (if you will) and the bigger picture was that it wasn't a time for pleasuring ones self, but rather a time for healing, and letting out the old (emotions, toxins, etc...) much like when you see those little strip malls getting renovated, and you see the brown paper on all the windows, not being able to see inside. Basically saying, "Closed for Business... be back soon"
I was on Predisone for 3 years, and my kidney's and Adrenals were kaput . . . and the thought of kissing a girl on the lips at that time turned me off so much, I thought I was losing my mind. I won't go into too much detail here, but let's just say that it was a few years of Celibacy for I started noticing the curves on a woman
There is MUCH change going on inside me.
I think a lot of communication has to come from you to your partner . . . focusing on "feelings" for a while, as opposed to physical pleasure.
It's a time that the relationship has a chance jump to the next level, taking a break from sex, and looking at what's in the Heart of each of you.
Then, when the time comes that you are Well, and ready to be present, and make Love again... LOOK OUT !!!
Rest up ! ;-)
Clint
CLINT! Prednisone is a miracle drug and the devil incarnate at the exact same time, I swear it. And I completely agree with what you said.
Communication is key, it really is. And not just talking at one another but talking WITH one another. You both need to be respectful of one anothers wishes, wants, whatever. You need to have an 'open forum' so you two can really hash stuff out but be sure to have some kind of 'safe word' (yes, this is in Kris' amazing book) to which you are just getting to too hurtful of a place. It works, I swear it!
Everybody has their own battles, survivors battles aren't the only ones that matter. And I'm not saying any of you walk around thinking it, but it's a very humbling experience to remember that your pain is your own, and the person next to you on the train has something just as trying as you, and the next five people down the way as well.
Wow I don't think that made sense!
Hi Everybody!
I had an appt with my oncologist this week and he is such a cool guy, was asking about my wheatgrass and raw food stuff so I brought my juice bar friend with samples. I don't know where it'll go from here, but I was amazed at his open attitude. My juice bar friend also is making some calls to see if she can get fresh juice offered at the snack bar. That would be SOOOOOO nice for patients and family stuck at the hospital. We also took wheat grass juice samples to the chemo room (my very last treatment!!!) and the nurses were VERY interested. I was extremely happy with the outcome of sharing...made me a little braver to share some more. I back off when I get that "are you crazy?" look, but some of them want to know more, so it's worth the risk.
I have x-rays and bone scans next Friday, the 8th, but I'm 99.9% sure they'll be clear. Still, if anybody wants to have a good thought for me that day...thanks.

I just want to back-up Clint's suggestion of MSM. The disease that I have causes major inflamation, and I started taking MSM back in September. It literally changed my life. Please do try it. There are no side effects or drug interactions.
Jennifer
Clint thanks, others thanks and keep sharing on this one it is helping me. I guess I just want to hug. I just finished my second dose of pred. I feel dead inside. Now I know why. I never thought it may have been drugs. Also...my body is changing alot because of the tumor. I am going through losing "my female parts", it is affecting me more than I thought. Plus all the other drugs to keep things in kilter.
SJ! Where is this pic of Clint all "growed up"?? Gotta see! Luv me some George Clooney.
Sorry Clint, not trying to embarass you.
Speaking of having friends here, anybody on Myspace?
Add me if U want :)
I'm also on facebook.
Cheers! I'm about to go to a superbowl party! What will I eat?? I'm eating an avocado salad before I go. Yum!
Hi Mary,
I can't offer you any advice, but you came to the right community. I'm so glad you have people here to help you out with this.
Good luck with everything! I'll be rooting for you.
Clint: Now I see why everyone has such a crush on you. Your open-heartedness is so endearing. Plus that bow tie, well, who can resist that?
This is apropos of nothing really, but Clint's repeated references to a multi-dimensional healing is prompting me to wonder: how many of us are adults who grew up in emotionally or physically abusive families of origin?
I, for one, was -- mother an alcoholic, father a covert case officer for the CIA (ever see The Good Shepherd? totally accurate as an emotional story) -- and even though I don't have canSer, I think there's a shared journey here of finding a new place in the world after an emergence from (or during the process of emerging from) fear and there's a shared sense of a rebirth of a new identity that comes from putting a stake in the ground and saying, "No, I'm going to do it this way. Thanks for the suggestion though."
So. Anyone have a rocky start in life? And if so, do you think it relates in some way to what you're going through now?
Hi Kris,
I am a hippy lurker. I saw you on Oprah, bought several copies of your book and gave them to friends who are fighting cancer. Your humor has saved me from the blues so many times. I brought a copy to my infusion center to show the nurses and some of the patients.
I am a two time cancer survivor. I had brain surgery in 2001 to remove an oligodendroglioma tumor and just celebrated my 7th year anniversary. I asked my neuro-oncologist at the time if there was a cure. He replied, "Only if I die from something else." However, I am now fighting rectal cancer. I had surgery with a permanent colostomy in Sept. 2007, and have just finished my 5th chemo treatment of Folfox.
I want to change the enviornment in my body so that cancer can no longer survive. It's my temple and I'm going to embrace it and decorate it (one of my goals is to get a tatoo when chemo is over in May.) Your book has helped me greatly to start on a kick ass natural healing path. I'm a microbiologist by trade, so all of this ought to come naturally to me; however, with the chemo, I don't want to drink or eat anything. I have to override this thought and work at making healing shakes with whey protein, etc. My biggest problem is my motivation and TASTE right now. I don't own a juicer yet. Any suggestions on one to get that is easy to clean? I have next to no energy right now.
What I really want is someone to come into my home and prepare meals for me, lead me in meditation, yoga, take me out for walks, etc. I know that that someone needs to be me. Just not there yet. I feel like a little girl.
Another book that I have found extremely helpful is, "How to Prevent and Treat Cancer with Natural Medicine", Dr. Michael Murray, et.al. He is with the "Seattle Cancer Treatment and Wellness Center".
Blessings to you for your search and perseverance. You have been an inspiration to me and to so many others.
Love enough to conquer fear,
Susan
Hi,
Kris-thanks for the vote! I just am very concerned about this planet, and I know that the people of this forum are just the ones to help in this plight. As I walked out of the public library this morning, there on the sidewalk, a styrofoam container with leftover food just tossed aside. It is sad. I toss it up to ignorance and a self-centered view of life. So my advice to all is to educate all who will listen re: your healthy lifestyle and the importance of a healthy planet & treating others with respect & compassion. I get the same odd looks from coworkers when I spout off, but I just make a joke at the end and say "stay tuned for the next installment of the world according to me." But actually, you'd be surprised, as you are being outwardly dismissed, you will touch a chord in some people. I recently took a collection for a local charity at my work & the response was wonderful.
As far as Exxon Mobil--the way to beat them is to support alternative energy sources. Solar and wind power. Biodiesel. Change your lightbulbs, unplug your microwave, and carpool/take public transportation. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Yes--it matters. It might be "inconvenient" but it is worth it! BTW, soon an electric/plug in car should be available--imagine--if powered by solar energy no more gas pump! No more reason to fight over oil! OR drill in Alaska!
Martha--Yes, go to the animalrescuesite.com and there are six very worthy charities--breast cancer, healthcare, literacy, rainforest, hunger, and animal rescue--just click once per day and these charities receive money from their sponsors. A very easy way to help make a difference!
Thanks for this forum! Peace, love, and veggies, & a green planet for all!
Just wanted to say that I am a huge supporter of the book club! It would be wonderful to share the reading of Michael Pollen's book with this community. I'm sure it would spark some great conversations. I am struggling to understand which produce is best to consume and which organic companies to trust. I used to think that Whole Foods only supplied organic produce, but I am wiser now. There is so much to learn and this blog is a huge help.
xoxo-Sundari
A quick note, then I will take the time and read what I have been missing this weekend!
Scan results: liver tumors are stable and there is no spread anywhere else. There are two possible new spots on my liver, but my doc is feeling that they are not tumors and could have always been there. The scans may never have really showed them before. We are going to hang on to that for now.
staying on avastin and switching to Cytoxan. then scan in 3 months. Anyway, I was too tired and drained to visit my cancer cohorts, but here I am. Can't wait to hear the new stuff!
Take care everyone.
Speaking of Ophrah..this has been my vision all day. A followup show where we allget to meet on one her back porches. Wouldn't that be killer. I am seeing the vision now come to life.
I, too, am a turmeric & MSM user.
Clint,
Have you always used the capsule form? I've been buying it in bulk & adding it to food. I'm not certain what the best dose is, but I'd get more if I went to capsule form, wouldn't I? I know Dr. Andrew Weil has touted turmeric for a number of years, as well as ginger, feverfew & black currant oil.
There definitely are more choices out there besides Prednisone & NSAIDS, however, I realize sometimes those are necessary for certain conditions but have can have some horrible side effects.
Grendle, your doc sounds cool. Good luck with the scan/xray results.
Going to watch the Superbowl. It's crazy down here with the FDR golf & Superbowl going on. The brown cloud that hangs over Phoenix is really bad this week. Yuck!
Sue
Hello Kris and cyber family,
please excuse me for jumping right in like long lost family, but right now that is right I need a family in the worst way and you are it.
I would like to share this web site, it is
this is a place that can tell you the ups and down of organic. Hope it can help in the confusion about organics of who to trust and who not to trust.
my best to all,

Yesterday I made this fun Elephant Bento for Eliana. I decided to go with a circus elephant :)
I did her lunch in an EasyLunchBox so that we could easily transport it and eat lunch with Bee-Baga (Great-Grandpa) :)
The elephant is an open faced ham and cheese sandwich, cheese placed on the top. Details were drawn on with an edible food marker. I added a candy eye, fruit leather and a hat food pick to add extra details on the elephant. The elephant is practicing an act on his pretzel rod balance beam. And what circus elephant would be complete without balancing a ball? The "ball" is a teeny tiny round silicone cup filled with yogurt covered raisins.
In the upper left I put flower cucumbers and a few blueberries, with an elephant pick.
In the lower left she has cut up strawberries with another elephant pick.
I don't know about you but one of the first thing I think about when I think about circus elephants is peanuts. I did not include peanuts in her lunch, even though it would have gone nicely with the theme. And actually, if you've been following my blog you will notice that I've never done a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I may have used peanut butter to "glue" the acorn together in the hungry squirrel lunch, but Eliana didn't eat it. Why you ask? (or maybe you don't, and if you don't then here is the gist of the next paragraph: there is a high probability that Eliana is allergic to peanuts!)
Ever since Eliana was little she never liked peanut butter. When she was two she ate a peanut butter jelly sandwich and broke out in hives all over her body (She had had PB before and never reacted, just never liked it). Because Eliana has the most incredible memory, and I'm not just saying that, from that point on she refused to eat peanut butter because of that reaction. She is four now, and the past two years have gone by and Eliana will not eat anything with PB. I always thought she was allergic to peanuts, but we kind of were on the fence about it. Since she didn't like peanuts and almost never had them it didn't seem to be a problem... and we figured she would outgrow it, but still we tended to avoid peanuts. However last week when we were eating trail mix I asked her to finish what was left in her bowl... so she licked a peanut. Her lip swelled up immediately. That did it for me.. She had never had any swelling before, so this was serious. We brought her to do blood test yesterday and we will be setting up the skin test soon. We will know for sure soon what her allergies are, but I'm pretty sure it is the peanuts. We'd rather be safe and figure out if she has any other allergies, which is why we are going through all the testing. All this to say: We didn't include peanuts in this lunch, and probably you won't be seeing any peanut butter sandwiches anytime soon! :)
I am SO thankful all that happened was a swollen lip. I watched her like a hawk and kept asking her every two seconds how she was feeling, while having my phone ready. And that reaction was only from one lick! It can be nerve-wracking to think your child has an allergy. You might even wish she or he doesn't have one and might miss out on life because of it (I can be dramatic sometimes). Well thankfully today there are SO many amazing products out there, and a much better awareness about allergies in general. Although right now Eliana refuses to eat any nut butter right now, probably because they "look like peanut butter", I know there are options out there should she ever want :) I'm very thankful, and relieved, we are getting to the bottom of this allergy soon and will be prepared if she ever were to have a reaction. I'm also super thankful this is so much easier to deal with because Eliana doesn't like PB anyways! My little girl knew all along it seems :)
**update**
We got the results back and Eliana is allergic to peanuts, cashews and pistachios. This came as a surprise to us as she had never even had a cashew or a pistachio so I wasn't even thinking there were other nut allergies! I am very thankful we got her tested and are now prepared in case of any emergency. We are clearly staying away from nuts at this point. It won't be too big of an adjustment for Eliana in general because she never liked nuts ever (she really did seem to know her allergy all along!) The adjustment will be double checking everything for cross contamination issues for nuts we weren't thinking about before. Now that we think about it David and I were wondering if that is why she so often said her "tummy hurt" after eating. We never gave it much thought since she would be fine a few minutes later. It could have been a cross contamination issue? We can't be sure, but we'll be paying closer attention to that.
So we are are a "new adventure" as my girl Sarah from Bentoriffc suggested I put it! We are going to be trying out new foods and alternatives for Eliana and for ourselves (once we finish what we have in our household we will no longer buy PB or trail mixes that are unsafe, just to be safe side. Eliana does like almonds, on a rare occasion, and does like Nutella and has never had a reaction to either. So we will keep those, however it will be easier to remind others to avoid PB and all nuts to avoid confusion.) So I'll be sharing some of our adventures of trying new products with you all, with some guidance from other PF and NF bloggers (specifically from my new BFF: Keeley McGuire) ;)
I link up. Check it out!
That elephant is adorable!
Thanks Keitha!! :)
Your elephant turned out great. What a fun lunch. I just pinned it.
Thank you Beth!!! I love your creations and I am honored that you pinned mine!! :)
so glad you got answers Michelle ~ i think our kids really DO know because it does effect them internally,not just externally. Smart cookie you have there ;)
Thanks Keeley! I'm SO thankful we never had to deal with any huge scares. And it does make sense that kids know that they are allergic. I'm glad she is a smart cookie :)
This is such an amazing lunch! That elephant is fantastic!
Thanks Mamabelly! :)
I am glad you got the allergy figured out. Great pick for your favorite Bento of the Week!

Thanks Diana! :)
Your elephant is adorable!! My Super Tot is severely allergic to peanuts and pistachios, too. We've been completely nut free for 2 1/2 years now, and it does get easier. E-mail me if you ever want to chat about it - bentosonthebayou @ gmail (dot) com.
Thanks Rebecca! I just saw your email!! I will respond soon :)
Wow pistachios too? That is unusual. I thought that was the new nut to replace all the others in cooking, maybe because of allergies(?) or because walnuts and pecans are just gross. That is a bummer. I have to avoid peanuts because of migraines which I guess is an allergy but just not as life threatening. Some days it can be a bummer when there is something really yummy made with peanuts.
I agree -- there are times where it is a bummer, more for me tho than her. She never liked nuts or peanut butter but sometimes *I* want something with peanut butter in it. However we have found the perfect substitution that keeps us all happy! Wowbutter and soynutbutter are both made from soybeans and seriously are the best substitute ever that everyone in the family loves! I've used them in baking as well :)

fam·i·ly
a. A fundamental social group in society typically consisting of one or two parents and their children.
b. Two or more people who share goals and values, have long-term commitments to one another, and reside usually in the same dwelling place.
So that's the dictionary's definition of family....but what it means to me is so much more. Family are the people that you can always go back to, the people that love you so much that there's not a thing in the world you can do that would change that. Family, you can count on to support you, hold you up when you feel like you can't do it for yourself.
It's where your roots are....
We started our family art project with packing paper from the Dollar Tree and stamped our hands with brown acrylic paint
Little Liam had to watch from the sidelines (momma's arms) after his tiny hand was stamped
My sweet hubby really got into this project....he's getting used to this kind of thing now :)
And when we were all finished....we stood back a realized we have quite a forest now....
Lots of roots....and that made us happier than we ever knew it would!

This is so pretty and a great idea!
I'm sharing on my FB page.
Ohhh how cute! And how special!!! I just love everything about this project! I love that Liam got to be part of the fun! That little guy is going to have so much fun as he grows up!!! But for right now how cool that he gets to hang out with momma while his family makes amazing projects!
:o)

This is sooooooo adorable! What a great family keepsake that you'll treasure for years to come!!
Such a cute photo, I love how personal this is.
Carmella! This is so darling!!!!
This is GENIUS!!!! I am pinning it! Thank you so much for sharing!
I love this idea! It is so sweet. Thanks for linking this to my party!
Renee
Absolutely LOVE this idea!! After my little girl is born in Jan. I'm so going to try this! Although my trees will have to be pretty close together since we are expecting our 5th! lol I'm your latest follower & would love for you to come by mine & visit & maybe follow back sometime!
Very cute idea! I don't know if I could get Hubby to join in the painting, but maybe if I beg...
I'd also want to do my cat's paw! LOL!
What a cute, creative idea! So unique and meaningful :)
Thank you, this is a "doable" idea for me and my family. I wonder if I have time this week. Last week we had a coloring contest so maybe the ball is beginning to roll.
Precious! I'm including this in a Friday Favorites post that I'm running through November. LOVE it! Feel free to stop by my blog and get an "I've Been Featured" Button : ) Thanks for sharing such a great project!
Jaimee @ craft-interrupted.blogspot.com
Thank you for taking the time to share this with us. I will be doing this with my family this week. Thank you for the inspiration!
I saw this featured over at Craft-Interrupted and I LOVE IT! Such a fantastic idea! :)!
I absolutely love this idea and I want to make my own. My only questions is, is the paper acid free? I'm concerned about it fading of becoming discolored over the years.
I loved this back months ago when I saw it. So cute and happy and fun! I wanted to share my version of it, inspired by you.
Thanks so much, I smile everytime I see it.
LOVE!!!!!

‘When I was a boy, the Dead Sea was only sick.’ – George Burns
When productivity ends, so can our will to go on. A gold watch and a pat on the back can be interpreted as the golden boot: ‘All right, thank you very much. Make way for the young now.’ You’re nothing but a ‘human resource’, off to the post office and then to the scrap-heap, drawing your pension once a week and scratching down lottery numbers while children squirt you with water pistols.
Lack of goals and a drop in productivity can spell disaster for the recently retired. The sudden change in pace and lack of mental stimulation seem refreshing at first but can lead to boredom, feelings of worthlessness, chronic depression and Jerry Springer. To compensate, many elderly adopt the habit of living in the past, which tells me they have nothing to look forward to. Far better to stay focused in the here-and-now, remaining active and mentally engaged, not slothful.
Find a job you like or start a business. Set mental tasks. Plan goals. Stay social and relevant. Travel. Make your fondest memories the years in which you have the greatest investment. What do you wish to accomplish by bed-time tonight? (The scale of achieving does not matter!)
- Retirement? I’m utterly against it
- Continue producing, you’ll have more fun
- The insurance companies have embezzled your pension fund anyway
- Never retire FROM something, always retire TO something
- Now is the time to use your skills to start a new project
- If you are lazy and not working at eighty, GET A JOB
- The extra income will be useful
- In most long-lived cultures, retirement is unknown. Everyone produces, some still fathering sprogs at ninety
- Employ the elderly. Seventy-year-olds know a lot of stuff
- Dream – Plan – Deliver, and I don’t mean pizza
- According to the longevity experts, at 65 you are approximately 55% of the way through your lifespan potential!
- Sitting at home does nothing but provoke feelings of worthlessness (big nocebo), owned up to even by lottery winners, who often face depression or return to work to avoid going loopy
- Why not work for yourself?
- Create! Produce! Serve!
- Show someone you’re still alive
- Blink!

One of them consisted of my mother coming in to my room to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in, then she would leave and everything would be dark for some time. Then, a monster would come into the room, leaving the door ajar. The floor between my door and my bed would expand to a great length and the monster would be right above my face, with bloody teeth. It was extremely lanky and skinny, with long legs and long arms, but a normal sized body and a slightly big head. Come to think of it, this monster resembled a shinigami (or death god, for those who don’t know) a little bit. At that point, I would wake up and run into my parents’ room, crying about how I had a nightmare and whatnot.
There was another dream I always had that I can't remember too vividly, except for one part, where I was with the Cat In The Hat surfing down a tunnel of goo as he was biting gummy bears' limbs off. Usually, that wouldn't be too scary, but blood came out when he chewed on them and he looked much like a sad clown.
The nightmares I have always remembered though, and tried to stay away from so badly, are the ones about the shadow man. When I went to sleep as a child, I would get in the fetal position and face my nearest wall before I drifted to sleep. When I found myself in the dream world, I would be in that same exact position. I would look around for a while, and there was a sort of haze around my vision. Everything in the distance would be blurry. I would look back at my wall to try and make it back to sleep, and then a shadowy figure that somewhat resembled the Monopoly game mascot (he looked as though he was wearing a suit and tie, and was cartoony in proportion and size) would slowly morph his way through the wall. He would point at me and yell words that seemed like they were in a different language. I couldn't wake up; my vision was locked on the evil shadow in front of me.
Eventually, I would wake from my slumber and tell my parents about my nightmare. After a few times of having this nightmare, my parents began to get worried. I was having this dream frequently now, and I was acting differently. I always checked the walls around me to make sure that the shadow man wasn't there. I was having the nightmare nearly every night, and sometimes I couldn't fall back to sleep out of fear that the shadow man would get me. In fact, that's what I told my parents as they were holding me, "I don't want the shadow man to get me, mommy... The shadow man is coming for me."
I stopped having the dreams for a few weeks, and I started to return to my normal self again. I no longer checked the walls for the shadow man, and I wouldn't have nightmares anymore. I felt more alive than I ever had been in my life; like a huge burden had been lifted from my shoulders. There was one night, however, that I will remember for the rest of my life. This was the most vivid dream I've ever had, and it has stuck in my brain for ages. I fell asleep as usual, with a huge reassurance that the shadow man was no longer haunting my sleeping self. I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was very thirsty. I could control my body, so I figured it was real life. I rolled out of bed and looked at my wall, confident with myself that I no longer dreamed of the shadow man.
To my surprise, he popped out of the wall again, yelling strange words to me. I recognized some of them, even though they were distorted and completely out of context from each other. A few of the words he shouted were “Apple, Candy, Trust, Silent, Axe, Fruit, and Tree”. They made no sense, but it scared me still. I ran to my parents’ bedroom, but they were not there. In place of them were two shadow men, lying in their place.
I started panicking, and I ran out into the living room. My parents were there, completely calm as my house changed colours and slightly twisted. I quickly told them about the shadow men everywhere, but they seemed like they could care less about them. One popped up on the wall right below the ceiling, and I pointed to him and yelled "There he is dad, there he is!" My dad simply looked up and said he saw nothing. I was begging my parents to help me, but they wouldn't do anything and continued watching a blank TV screen. I was still convinced this was real, and I tried opening the doors out of my house to get out. They were all locked, and I could do nothing to escape the living room. I ran over to the couch and curled up, scared so bad I was sweating and I could hardly breathe. I kept yelling "Go away, GO AWAY!" but nothing could stop the shadow man from yelling at me. He was on the inside of my eyelids as I closed them; I could see him here, there, everywhere. Everything went silent, and I heard just softly spoken words:
"Turn Away."
I blacked out. When I woke up the next morning, I was no longer in my bed, but I was on the couch, right where I was when I huddled up in the nightmare before. I told my parents about everything, but they had no knowledge of anything that happened. They said that they had not watched any TV last night, and they had gone straight to bed and they never even heard a peep from me. This chilled me down to the bone. Everything was so vivid; it had to have been real. But the only thing that had changed was that I had woken up on the couch instead of in my bed. Everything was normal.
That night, I was so afraid to fall asleep that I couldn't. I just played with my toys until the morning came. The next night, I got busted for playing with my toys and my parents took them all away from me. I curled up and faced the wall to sleep as usual, and closed my eyes. After a few seconds, I remembered the words I heard from two nights before, telling me to turn away.
I heeded this advice as best as I could, and faced away from the wall as I fell asleep. I haven't had another encounter with the shadow man since then, and I still never face the wall nearest to me when I sleep. You would think after all these years, I would grow up and just move on, but no. I am still scared of that shadow man. I can't put a finger on what exactly scares me about him, but there is something there that scares me to this day that urges me to turn away.

Ghaziabad: Virender Sehwag's dazzling knock of 107 went in vain as Uttar Pradesh inflicted a six-wicket defeat on Delhi in the Ranji Trophy Group B tie here on Monday. Chasing a target of 155 in 50 overs after Delhi were all out for 322 in their second innings, UP reached home in 39.2 overs with Mukul Dagar and skipper Suresh Raina setting the platform, scoring 37 runs apiece.
After the dismissal of both batsmen, it was left to Arish Alam (15 not out) and Ali Murtaza (14 not out) to see the hosts through. The outright win fetched UP six points. Raina promoted himself to No. 4 after Mohammed Kaif couldn't come in to bat due to finger injury. He batted fluently with five hits to the fence during his 46-ball stay.
Earlier, Delhi looked like they would force a draw till the time Sehwag was at the crease. The dasher, who came in to bat at No. 6 because of a sore finger, played some scintillating shots. Resuming at 21, Sehwag reached the three-figure mark in 146 balls with the help of 18 boundaries.
Sehwag unleashed some truly breathtaking shots, smashing as many as seven boundaries in the morning itself to bring up his 50.
Making matters worse for the home team, Raina dropped Sehwag at second slip with the latter batting on 70, off the bowling off Imtiaz Ahmed. Sehwag certainly knew that he was the only hope for Delhi.
Unfortunately, his vigil couldn't help the visitors cross the danger mark. He was the ninth man out on 314, holing out to Praveen Kumar at mid-on in an attempt to launch Imtiaz over the top.
BRIEF SCORES
Delhi 235 and 322 (V. Sehwag 107, M. Manhas 65; B. Kumar 4/94, I. Ahmed 4/112). Uttar Pradesh 403 and 158/4 (S. Raina 37). Uttar Pradesh won by 6 wickets.

Earth Day
I took A1A to work the other day, from South Beach to Hollywood Boulevard, and counted the number of construction sites I passed on that one street: 44. There is a weird time-travel quality to this trip; the gleaming, glass trump-phalluses share space with quaint relics whose days are obviously numbered. In a year this stretch of road will be very different.
Given that the clock on the wall says it’s Earth Day, there’s a few points to be made about what’s up with this. First, what’s being built isn’t going up on top of pristine beaches or protected estuaries, and what’s coming down is 40 – 60 year old one-and-two story mom and pop style motels, some of which are studies in kitsch and bad taste (but nevertheless interesting). This is a case of erection-swapping, as it were. There’s limited new environmental impact (“No cliffs, sands, or bluffs”).
That said, it doesn’t automatically follow that lining up high-rises on the edge of the ocean is a terrific idea, either. There’s the aesthetics of it – lots of beautiful new buildings are still lots of buildings – as well as the impact of a trillion people and their waste, traffic, mere presence to contend with. Plus the canyonesque wind tunnel effect: On a moderately breezy day, a fart in Golden Isles could carry down AIA all the way to South Beach. Speaking of Trump.
Critical Miami does not have a problem with times changing. We like new stuff! All we’re saying is that stuff is changing fast. Enjoy it before it’s gone.comments powered by Disqus
After reading this article, it brought to mind a discussion I recently had with a builder. In Sunny Isles, for example, one of the ridiculously high story condominiums being built is 50 stories high. Many of the buildings are not only sinking and have to be re-built but totally block out the sun on the beach in the afternoon. People actually flock to Florida for the sunny weather and the beaches. Florida is greedily cutting its own throat and ruining the aesthetics of the beach areas.It is sad and unfortunate to observe the “new” Florida. What is even more irritating is that foreign factions are buying these properties at top prices only to raise the prices and immediately flip them for their own financial gains leaving 80% of the condos empty.It’s a huge dilemma that is never ending and a sad commentary on the trendy,obsessive exploitation that is taking place in South Florida today.

We have sometimes rented movies from Amazon Unbox because they download right to our Tivo. They give you 30 days to start watching the rental, which I think is just fine, but once you start you have to finish within 24 hours or your movie is deleted. This is problematic.
Let’s say you start watching a rental at 7pm one evening. Life happens, your 16-month-old demands attention, and you only get halfway through. The next night you have to be absolutely sure you start working on finishing it a safe amount before 7pm. Because if you’re not finished by 7pm it’s going to be automatically deleted. That sucks. Why not make the rentals last 36 hours so that this kind of time crunch is elimininated? Is this really such a problem that the movie studios can’t relax just a little bit? All I want is to be able to comfortably watch a rental over 2 evenings because we find it hard to get through 2 hours in one shot.
This has certainly put us off renting very many movies. And now there are rumors that iTunes rentals are going to have the same 24 hour limit. Come on!
I’m glad to see that I’m not the only one who feels this way: The 27-Hour Day Campaign.

By clue 2, neither Jim nor Art gets out of the van pool at
16th St., so either Carol or Linda does. If Carol gets
out at 16th St., by clues 2 and 3, Jim would get out at
Declaration Pl. Then Linda's commute would end at either
Benford Blvd. or Melrose Ave.--no (4). So, Linda gets
out of the van at 16th St. Since Carol doesn't get out
first (3), by clue 2, Jim does, with Linda then getting
out second. The only way for clue 3 to work is for Carol
to get out fourth, with Art then getting out third at
Declaration Pl. By clue 1, Jim's commute ends at Benford
Blvd. and Carol's at Melrose Ave. The four van pool riders
get out in order

April 16, 2008Keeneland Race 5Maiden Special Weight4.5 furlongs2 Year Old FilliesPost Time: 3:10 PM; TVG
Mostly Peace
Mostly Peace (filly; Peace Rules - Ms. Mostly by Copelan) becomes our 2nd starter for our 1st-time sires and the first starter for Peace Rules. She sold for $80,000 as a yearling. Mostly Peace's dam earned $276,525 and won or placed in 8 stakes including a victory in the Pucker Up (gr. II). She also ran 9 times as a 2-year old registering two wins and 5 thirds. Ms. Mostly has produced 2 winners, including Fire Wood who earned $210,660. Although Fire Wood did not win as a 2-year old, he did start twice and recorded two 2nd place finishes.
Three other first-year sires are represented in this race including Chapel Royal who won the Flash (gr. III) and the Sanford (gr. II) as a 2-year old. Chapel Royal is the sire of Iberian Gate (Chapel Royal - White Cliffs by Dover Ridge). Iberian Gate sold for $340,000 in February at the OBS 2-year olds in training sale. White Cliffs was a stakes winner who earned $245,542 including a victory in the Kattegat's Pride Stakes as a 2-year old. Overall, her 2-year old record was 6 starts, 4 wins, 1 second, and 1 third. And, she broke her maiden first time out going 4.5 furlongs. 4 out of 5 of her offspring who have made the races have won, 3 of these won in the 2-year old season (2 were victorious in their debuts).
Lookbeforeyouleap (The Cliff's Edge - Be My Lover by Belong to Me) is from the first-crop of Toyota Blue Grass winner (gr. I) The Cliff's Edge. Be My Lover has produced 1 winner from 1 to race. This winner, Run Lover Run, ran 8 times as a 2-year old winning once, finishing 2nd twice, and third once.
From the first-crop of grade III winner Omega Code is Cheyenne Code (Omega Code - Zeebler by Tomorrows Cat). Cheyenne Code is the first foal out of an unraced mare to make it to the races. Her dam is a half-sister to four winners. However, none won as a 2-year old.
Among the entries not by first-year stallions of interest is Dorothy's Essense (Essence of Dubai - Leedle Dee by Distinctive Pro) who sold for $35,000 as a yearling. Her dam earned $157,224 including a victory in the East View Stakes as a 2-year old. Dorothy's Essense is her first foal.
Also of note is Terrifany (Fusaichi Pegasus - Pesci by Stormy Atlantic) who is the first foal out of the grade I-placed mare, Pesci who earned $152,001.
2-Year Old Works
Returning to the WorkTab (horses previously mentioned in this blog)
Two Medaglia d'Oro fillies were on track at Goldmark on 4/12 both working 4 furlongs. Fiesta d'Oro (Medaglia d'Oro - Ionian Bride by Icecapade) recorded a time of :50.40 while Double Espresso's (Medaglia d'Oro - Second Strike by Fast Play) time was :50.60.
Also on 4/12 at Silverton Hill Farm, Ambraw (colt; Congaree - Fabulous Flight by Flying Continental) worked 4 furlongs in :51.85.
At Calder on 4/15, Precious Beans (colt; Medaglia d'Oro - Precious Feather by Gone West) went 5 furlongs, recording a time of 1:05.00.
Working 3 furlongs on 4/15 were Gabby's Golden Gal (filly; Medaglia d’Oro – Gabriellina Giof (GB) by Ashkalani (IRE)) who recorded a time of :34.40 at Hollywood Park and Tiger Rules (colt; Peace Rules - Danzig Tiger by Danzig Connection) whose time was :38.00 at Keeneland. Tiger Rules has been entered in a Maiden Special Weight race Friday at Keeneland.
New to this blog
Two Congaree colts make their workout debut on this blog both working 3 furlongs at El Primero Training Center on 4/15. Conga Rock (Congaree - Spectacular Lisa by Formal Gold) recorded a time of :39.60. Spectacular Lisa was a stakes winner who earned $209,600. She did not run as a 2-year old. Conga Rock is her first foal. Congo Creek (Congaree - Lost Expectations by Valid Expectations) worked in :39.80. Lost Expectations earned $80,294 in a career that included a third place in the Schuylerville Stakes (gr. II) as a 2-year old. She has had one offspring to race, a filly who finished 4th in her only start last year as a 2-year old.
i so love Peace Rules.hes so tough,gritty.i cant wait to see if his kids are as tough.

3.16 Procedures
Returns #t if v is a procedure, #f otherwise.
The apply Function in Guide: PLT Scheme introduces apply.
Applies proc using the content of (list* v ... lst) as the (by-position) arguments. The #:<kw> kw-arg sequence is also supplied as keyword arguments to proc, where #:<kw> stands for any keyword.
The given proc must accept as many arguments as the number of vs plus length of lst, it must accept the supplied keyword arguments, and it must not require any other keyword arguments; otherwise, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised. The given proc is called in tail position with respect to the apply call.
Returns a procedure that composes the given functions, applying the last proc first and the first proc last. The composed functions can consume and produce any number of values, as long as each function produces as many values as the preceding function consumes.
3.16.1 Keywords and Arity
The apply Function in Guide: PLT Scheme introduces keyword-apply.
Like apply, but kw-lst and kw-val-lst supply by-keyword arguments in addition to the by-position arguments of the vs and lst, and in addition to the directly supplied keyword arguments in the #:<kw> kw-arg sequence, where #:<kw> stands for any keyword.
The given kw-lst must be sorted using keyword<?. No keyword can appear twice in kw-lst or in both kw-list and as a #:<kw>, otherwise, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised. The given kw-val-lst must have the same length as kw-lst, otherwise, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised. The given proc must accept all of the keywords in kw-lst plus the #:<kw>s, it must not require any other keywords, and it must accept as many by-position arguments as supplied via the vs and lst; otherwise, the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.
Returns information about the number of by-position arguments accepted by proc. See also procedure-arity?.
A valid arity a is one of the following:
An exact non-negative integer, which means that the procedure accepts a arguments, only.
A arity-at-least instance, which means that the procedure accepts (arity-at-least-value a) or more arguments.
A list containing integers and arity-at-least instances, which means that the procedure accepts any number of arguments that can match one of the elements of a..
If the prop:procedure property value is an integer, it designates a field within the structure that should contain a procedure. The integer must be between 0 (inclusive) and the number of non-automatic fields in the structure type (exclusive, not counting supertype fields). The designated field must also be specified as immutable, so that after an instance of the structure is created, its procedure cannot be changed. (Otherwise, the arity and name of the instance could change, and such mutations are generally not allowed for procedures.) When the instance is used as the procedure in an application expression, the value of the designated field in the instance is used to complete the procedure call. (This procedure can be another structure that acts as a procedure; the immutability of procedure fields disallows cycles in the procedure graph, so that the procedure call will eventually continue with a non-structure procedure.) That procedure receives all of the arguments from the application expression. The procedure’s name (see object-name), arity (see procedure-arity), and keyword protocol (see procedure-keywords) are also used for the name, arity, and keyword protocol of the structure. If the value in the designated field is not a procedure, then the instance behaves like (case-lambda) (i.e., a procedure which does not accept any number of arguments). See also procedure-extract-target.
Providing an integer proc-spec argument to make-struct-type is the same as both supplying the value with the prop:procedure property and designating the field as immutable (so that a property binding or immutable designation is redundant and disallowed).
When the prop:procedure value is a procedure, it should accept at least one argument count of the property-value procedure. If the property-value procedure cannot accept at least one argument, then the instance behaves like (case-lambda).
Providing a procedure proc-spec argument to make-struct-type is the same as supplying the value with the prop:procedure property (so that a specific property binding is disallowed)..
After the first application of the result of curry, each further application accumulates arguments until an acceptable number of arguments have been accumulated, at which point the original proc is called.
A function call (curry proc v ...) is equivalent to ((curry proc) v ...). In other words, curry itself is curried.
The curry function provides limited support for keyworded functions: only the curry call itself can receive keyworded arguments to be propagated eventually to proc.
Like curry, except that the arguments are collected in the opposite direction: the first step collects the rightmost group of arguments, and following steps add arguments to the left of these.

New Delhi, May 18 2010
New Delhi, May 18, 2010: It is a well known fact that India produces as well as imports thousands of tonnes of electronic waste every year. Almost all of this waste is recycled or scrapped by the unorganized sector, using the most rudimentary methods that pollute.
What may not be so well known is that the government’s new draft e-waste rules, announced in April this year, refuse to recognize and help organize this key sector. Instead, the ministry of environment and forests has chosen to grant its first and only licence to import e-waste to a company called Attero Recycling. And undercover investigations done by researchers from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) have found Attero reselling e-waste, instead of recycling it.
Down To Earth, a science and environment fortnightly that CSE helps publish, has come out with a complete expose of the e-waste industry, the illegal trade that thrives in this sector, the horrific working conditions, and the immense pollution that results from all of these.
Regulations which may not achieve much
The investigations by CSE spanned the main e-waste dismantling and recycling hub in India – from Seelampur in Delhi to Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. More than 90 per cent of the e-waste generated in the country lands up in the unorganized market, reports CSE.
The government, says the CSE report, assumes it will be able to regulate the informal sector through its proposed rules on e-waste, which allow only registered companies with updated and safe technologies to recycle e-waste. This leaves in the lurch an overwhelming majority of the existing e-waste recycling industry.
India generated 330,000 tonnes of e-waste in 2007 – equal to 110 million laptops. About 10 per cent of the e-waste generated is recycled every year; the remaining is refurbished, and the unorganized sector is right behind almost all of it. Informal dealers refurbish and make money from e-waste.
The organized e-waste recycling industry, of course, cries foul at these practices. Organized and formal recyclers have welcomed the new e-waste rules. Says Kushal P S Yadav, head of CSE’s toxins and solid waste unit, “However, CSE’s undercover forays into the business dealings of Attero Recycling have exposed the double-talk – a company favored by the government is not doing what it claims to specialize in.”
According to CSE, the government’s new draft rules ignore the reality and are likely to be toothless. It is estimated that illegal import of e-waste in the country stands at about 50,000 tonnes annually. Loopholes in laws facilitate this. For instance, the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act of 1992 provides for donation of computers to educational and charitable institutions, hospitals, etc.
The government’s new draft rules declare such imports for charity illegal – without giving any thought to the other ways through which e-waste is imported, such as under the pretext of metal scrap and second-hand electrical appliances.
The proposed rules, for the first time in India, bring in the concept of extended producer responsibility, making manufacturers liable for safe disposal of electronic goods. However, they do not detail the business model for collection of e-waste from consumers. Neither do they offer any assistance to help the informal sector get organized.
India is a global dump for hazardous waste and e-waste
India wants global waste, and gets what it wants: the CSE analysis looks at the entire hazardous and e-waste import industry. It also reveals how developed countries are using free trade agreements (FTAs) to export their waste to the developing world. Japan and the EU, for instance, are currently negotiating with India and a deal is likely to be signed this year. The commerce ministry has not made public details of about 30 such deals that India is negotiating.
According to CSE, the cause for concern is the part of the draft text of an FTA between the EU and India, which was leaked. This leaked text coins a new name for waste: it says “non-new goods shall be understood to include notably used and remanufactured goods” and that “non-new goods” would not have any restrictions such as import or export tariffs.
Thus, import of waste could be treated just like import of fresh products. This could result in enormous increase in the import of wastes in India, which would severely hamper environmental safeguard measures.
So what is the way out? Says Sunita Narain, director, CSE: “The choice India faces is this – either it becomes a dumping ground for the world’s waste, or regulates the recycling and the trade better so as to import only non-hazardous and recyclable waste.”
For clarifications and details, please contact Souparno Banerjee (souparno@cseindia.org, 9910864339) or Kushal P S Yadav (kushal@cseindia.org, 9810867667).

In my efforts to catch up with older CSI cases I ended up working on case 11... AGAIN!
I have no idea how on earth I have forgotten the fact that, not only I already worked on it, but also got on the watch list! with that page...
Crazy... I guess I subconsciously LOVED the case too much hehe...
Well, this time I started off with a page that had some interesting lines on it, that inspired everything else.
I used watercolors (wet on wet) to get the PAINT ON THE BACKGROUND and then pasted TORN paper from the coordinates onto some of the images.
My journaling was scattering text all over the page. I ended up writing two different sentences, one in black and one in red, but the lines are all mixed up so you have to follow the color in order to read them right...
I used a photo from 2004, when Alana, my eldest girl, graduated from kindergarten.
I have updated my blog! yey!! and this time, specially for my CSI friends, I decided to write them bilingually so that you can read and actually understand it :) (it used to be all in Spanish).
I also caught up with older posts that were UNDER CONSTRUCTION so feel free to have a look at it and comment on the post if you want to.
I'm really new to blogging so I'll appreciate your comments, suggestions or whatever!
This is my blog:
and here a couple of closeups from this page:

Beautiful soft watercolours! And a fabulous layout, I am glad you did the same case file again! TFS!
Wonderful water colour effects and the doodling!
Great layout! Love the watercolor and all the different elements on the page!!
Thank you Adrienne and Helena. I know... it must have been something in my subconscious that made me work on it again and again hehehe. It was so funny when I realized the fact that hey! these colors look familiar!? But the funniest thing was that I first thought I had uploaded the previous ORIGINAL case 11 page under a wrong case number! It took me a while to really discovered I worked on it twice and that both pages belonged to the same case... how silly is that! it was lots of fun :)
Love the water colors and the whole construction of this page. And I love the fact that you made a second layout with this case file:)))
Gorgeous paint and doodles across your pages. Love that you played it again-even though you didnt mean to!

If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, DI is used as the destination register; otherwise, the address-size attribute is 32 bits and EDI is used.
The address of the memory data being compared is determined solely by the contents of the destination register, not by the operand to SCAS. The operand validates ES segment addressability and determines the data type. Load the correct index value into DI or EDI before executing SCAS.
After the comparison is made, the destination register is automatically updated. If the direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), the destination register is incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), it is decremented. The increments or decrements are by 1 if bytes are compared, by 2 if words are compared, or by 4 if doublewords are compared.
SCASB, SCASW, and SCASD are synonyms for the byte, word and doubleword SCAS instructions that don't require operands. They are simpler to code, but provide no type or segment checking.
SCAS can be preceded by the REPE or REPNE prefix for a block search of CX or ECX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for further details.

Eight inches of snow and the transport network collapses.. so we've been snowed in for a couple of days which has been quite fun!
I made my Christmas cards yesterday. I folded sheets of cotton-fibre paper (that I bought a couple of years ago and never used) and cut out stocking shapes. Then I put fabric behind the openings and stitched around the edges with white thread to hold the sandwich of layers together.
We've also put up our tree, and I made a skirt for the base which Honey thinks I made especially for her to lounge on.
9 comments:
I love your cards. Isn't the snow crazy? We had about 5 inches yesterday morning and everythings still recovering from that!
adorable. Look how cute Honey is! Love the cards!
Totally adorable.
loooove your cards!
Just adorable !
Your cards are adorable and so is Honey! Being snowed in sounds fun. :) We've just had the lightest dusting of snow where I am - I can't wait until more of it starts to stick around! Of course, I'm sure I'll immediately start wishing for Spring, but it's exciting at first!
Wow, your Christmas cards are beautiful! Hope you're enjoying the festive season:)
wow! snow! Someday...I would just love to have a white christmas, and your cat is gorgeous :)
Oh, your cat look so sweet.

Updating your Wardobe – Your Fashion Editor’s Guide to Keeping it ‘Fresh’ this Autumn/Winter
So the summer sunshine has somehow paved it’s way to different climates, and the winter is upon us – fear not, Autumn and Winter make way for a bright, cosy and wonderful array of eye catching apparel.
This season focusses on a specatacle of blockbuster trend in mix wardrobe tweaks, beauty tips and an uplifting party mood. Here are your Fashion Editor’s top tips for Style this Autumn Winter – From the return of glamour and glitter, to clothes you will never get lost in.
Belt it Up.
One trend that stands out for this season is the belt-cinched waist. Perfectly accompanied with your fur coat for the Winter. The most practical but fun element to this trend is the fact that it can easily be acquired! Involving less effort outside of buying a belt or digging one out of your already, fabulous wardrobe.
Burberry’s bow belt adds that little bit more character – as weall love those quirky little signature elements in our style.
Owl’ing
What better way to celebrate this beautiful season than to present some illustrative flavour to your wardrobe – The Owl symbol has played happy to an array of summer tees and continues to be embellished in a variety of knitwear and autumn, winter dresses. Burberry Prorsum presented an impressive collection of bead designed Owl prints on a multitude of heavy knits earlier this year – illustrating an authentic, homespun look.
The Signature Jumper
Here it comes – the Autumn/Winter ‘Hero’ piece – the most eye catching piece for your wardrobe has to be the multi hue Jumper. Get into the Trend game this season and aquire yourself one of these casual day to evening beauties. To qualify this trend, it’s simple. Your knits need to incorporate a substantial stitch or some kind of eye catching detail. For Catwalk inspiration, take a look at the splendid collection by Johnathan Saunders and Pringle of Scotland. Signature Jumper, approved!
Glitter that Pout
Our continuing celebration of all things vibrant and 80′s proceeds forward this season with a touch of pucker sparkle. What better way to compliment this coming season with that much warranted need for vibrance and dazzle than to execute a generous amount of lip decor.Fear not, this look was not only triumphant for Spring/Summer – in keeping with the trend of glitter in knits, this look will be at it’s most popular this season. Who said sparkle was just for the catwalk?
If you’re feeling brave, get the full glitter-lip look, as seen at Kinder Aggugini, with a temporary lip tattoo from violentlips.com
Dip to ‘Dye’ For
That’s right, gone are the days of meticulous one tone colour hair – From the ‘withering heights’ of Kate Bush and the continued love for 80′s style comes the rock and roll style of dip dyed hair. A great trend style for this season – think warm brunette meets the rustic, raw colour of autumn leaves or lilac blonde meets orange glow. Dip dying is in full play this season, and as always, out designer counterparts showcased this look at a variety of Runway shows this year. Most notably Pringle of Scotland’s hair stylist Paul Hanlon, dip dyed all the models’ locks in hues that contrasted the collection, beautifully. This is a simple yet effective look, that can enhance your style with minimal effort.
Print It!
Being one of this year’s most sought after trends, this season sees a continued admiration for printed dresses. Aztec took our fashion world by storm earlier in 2012, with our global catwalk’s presenting a range of muti print embodied shift, paisley, skater and chiffon inspired dresses. This season we see a myriad of floral, geometric and map designed prints on a range of shirts, midi’s, chino’s, jeans and leggings. In play with sheer chiffon shirts in pastel colours, this is a perfect way to create that much aquired seasonal look of ‘loud meets minimal’ – so chic.
Rock those Jewels
This season is ALL about being rough and raw, with texture and surface being of poignant importance. In perfect balance with the ‘earthy’ raw meets vibrant style of the season, why not embrace the natural landscape of hidden treasure and celebrate the earth’s bounty from below the crust!
The Bigger the Better – Keep the more minimal, understated pieces from your jewellery box under wraps for now, instead, steer your style focus on oversized jewellery; eye catching geometric shaped earrings and geometric shaped heavy neck pieces. Rings with ‘stand out’ appeal - celebrating the beauty and infectious look of precious metal.

Tumalo Farms, located near the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, was started by Flavio DeCastilhos, who became inspired during a trip to Brazil's wine country. Flavio, who had a very successful career within the IT world, became fascinated with the local cheese industry.
Starting a farm and a business from scratch gave DeCastilhos the opportunity to build a state-of-the-art cheesemaking operation. He spent two years researching and learning about cheesemaking and farming, during which time he became interested in producing traditional Dutch and Italian cheeses, and in experimenting with local ingredients to develop new recipes..

comes with lists that are ready for your to-dos:
What do you want to do Today? What are the tasks you want to get to Next? And what do you want to Schedule for a later day? Everything has its place.
When entering new to-dos you can quickly add all important information: enter the title, notes, and due date. You can also tag to-dos so you can find them more easily later. Things remembers everything so you don't have to.
The Daily Review lets you see everything that needs your attention: to-dos that are scheduled for today automatically appear at the top of your Today list, together with to-dos that have become due.
Never miss something.
No matter where you are, or what you want to focus on right now, Things makes it easy to find exactly the right to-dos. You can add tags to your to-dos, like "Home", "Errands", or "High". Use them for the things you want to do at home, when running errands, or when something is very important. Later, when you're ready to get them done, easily find these to-dos by filtering your lists by those tags.
Projects are an easy way to group and view relevant to-dos together. Whenever you want to work on a project, simply open it in Things, then focus on getting it done - one to-do at a time. You can even group multiple projects and to-dos together into Areas: "Family, "Work", "Hobby", "Health", or whatever makes sense to you. Things makes it easy to stay on top of all your responsibilities in life.
Things strikes a balance between ease of use and powerful features. Its polished user interface and attention to detail make it a delight to use. It's hard to find anything quite like it.
“Things sets itself apart in flexibility and ease.”
“Things definitely tops our list of GTD applications for the iPhone.”
“If Things sounds simple, that's because it is. Other to-do list managers I've tried have, quite honestly, gotten in the way of me getting things done. Things doesn't do that. And I wouldn't have it any other way.”

This post is long overdue but oh well. I’ve received many questions about my studio apartment tour in the Everygirl (mostly about my pink ikat rug!), so I wanted to share a few more photos and provide some of the sources too. My favorite place to shop for my apartment is Home Goods (and Craigslist too), so a lot of those things can’t be sourced. But if I left out anything, leave me a comment and I’ll tell you where it’s from.
Ikea dresser (old) | cube | Home Goods mirror | lamp | DIY art | Osborne and Little wallpaper
I love my little “dressing area” when I step out of bed onto a soft flotaki rug.
Desk | Ghost Chair | Notebooks | lamp
When I actually do sit down to write at my desk, it’s a fantastic place to work. But let’s be honest, I’m mostly blogging from my bed or couch.
Blogs and Coffee print | framed Missoni pansy fabric | framed yearbook cover
Kitchen Aid Mixer | Apron | Measurement Print | my own lemon paintings
My mixer’s name is Ruby and she’s fabulous, isn’t she?
West Elm Tray | Home Goods wine rack | Crate & Barrel champagne flutes (old) | Paper Source paper that I put behind some of the cubes | my own art
Ikea Table | Chairs | Bookshelf | Bar Table from Home Goods which I spray painted gold
My apartment is never this clean btw!
Ikat rug | Flokati Rug | Duvet
A wall of windows really provides great light in my apartment and makes it feel so much bigger than it is.
French pillow | Coffee table and side table: found on Craigslist | Couch: passed down from a friend | Gray fleece chairs: Bloomingdales from the 1980s | metallic pillows from Urban Outfitters (old)
For my wallpaper entry, I tore out full pages of magazines with images I love – food (the fired chicken photo might be my favorite), fashion, interiors, cute boys, colorful designs – and using double sided tape, I put them up in rows. I think there’s about 150 pages up on the wall. I can easily remove one image if I find another one I like.
Also, how embarrassing. I forgot to clean up that messy area above my fridge where I store bags of chips and pans. Oops. :)
If you haven’t already, head over to the Everygirl and read more about my apartment.
Oh, and if you want to see something hilarious, check out this post from 2009 where I share some photos from my then brand new apartment. It feels nice to look back and see how both my apartment and I have grown.

What is the Movie Called The Cure for Insomnia
Author: Solution Finders
What
It was first played in its entirety at The School Of The Art Institute in Chicago, Illinois from January 31 to Feb. 3, 1987
the movie Cure For Insomnia
was released January 31, 1987.
The Cure for Insomnia is the longest movie ever made at a total running time of 87 hours.
Cure for Insomnia consists of L.D. Groban reciting his own poem, inter linked with X-rated film footage and music videos.ChaCha!
The movie was directed by
John Henry Timmis IV and he wrote and directed the 1987 movie "The Cure for Insomnia".
It's runtime is 5220 minutes. That's 87 hours!
Do you know what happens in the brain when you have narcolepsy?
Okay now pay attention, this is deep and if you have doubts at all, You really should be asking a professional other than me. with that said, here are the basics
Narcolepsy means you have no orexins, no fighting genes against sleep.
researchers think this is caused by our auto-immune systems destroying them during the fetal development of that particular part of the brain, possibly in response to exposure to a virus. our brains are missing a particular peptide (amino acids) called hypocretins or orexins. (those born in march have a higher rate of being born with this, partly because the mother is in her second trimester during the big cold/flu season...while those born in later September have the smallest, which puts the pregnant mom in her second trimester during a low cold/flu time of year.) Not in Flu season, So the resistance is low. These orexins regulate functions like the body's ability to keep its self up and stay awake.
Vigorous excercise several times a day, Caffeine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine are the over the counter stimulants for Narcolepsy.
The circus of ever sprouting medication for sleep disorders are only part of the cure. The real cure is your life's work. Do and perform your life's work. In The movie LD Groban (poet L.D. Groban) recites his own poem of 4,080 pages. His life's work should reprogram biological clocks for insomniacs and for that matter narcoleps so you can order your bodies natural sleep cycle again.
Don't take medication geared towards mental health issues lightly. You don't want to get in to all that if you can help it. Do and perform your life's work. Many of these drugs are addictive or they have very serious side effects. This includes
antidepressant Elavil, which is WAY too strong for many. It makes many terribly drowsy and lethargic, not good for someone with narcolepsy!
Tofranil (generic: imipramine) which works well for some because its an antidepressant.
and Ritalin is disliked by all. Tamiflu is prescribed for insomnia.All of these medicines should be subscribed by a doctor. Just say no if you can help, and you can. Do and perform your life's work.
Now with insomnia
Your body should adjust to the new wake up time and let you go to sleep when it needs to.
Set your alarm to one time (the time you want to wake up each morning) and follow it strictly.
Ironically the cure for insomnia perhaps is the same cure for narcolepsy.
Do and perform your life's work.
-To help you get to sleep/and stay up just enough and to give the body energy to disipline the mind to sleep enough is as follows from all diagnosis:
-make sure there is no noise, no light, smells fine and the room temperature is a cool 65 --degrees and your comfortable in bed.
-exercise in the morning to help you get to sleep/and stay up just enough
-during the day get lots of sunlight
-take a warm bath and have a warm glass of milk or cup of chamomile tea before sleep
don't have any caffeine. be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day.
-don't have a big meal before going to sleep but also don't go to sleep on an empty stomach. have a small snack, such as yogurt (which also contains tryptophan).
- don't watch tv or use the computer for at least a half hour before sleep. Instead do something in a dimmer light to help you get to sleep/and stay up just enough to help you get to sleep/and stay up just enough
By making small lifestyle changes like having a fixed
daily routine, relaxing and eating properly, insomnia can be
cured.
Insomnia (sleeplessness) is due to stress, dietary and medical
problems.
Achieving discipline, order and rest control means you need to go to bed at the same time every night regardless of whether you feel tired or not & once in bed - minimal tv,reading.
Sleep is all about developing a schedule to maintain a normal cycle. Your body needs to establish that the bed is for sleep & nothing else.
No matter what you decide to do, you need to have a professional observing the effects the drug has on your brain and your body. The people answering your question on this site, cannot make these observations even if they know what they are talking about (don't take that for granted). TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL!!!
Today prepare to fight. Prepare to fight to do your life's work. fight who? fight the urge and the compulsion to self destruct and to stay the same. stop the urge and the inclination to tell yourself that "You can't sleep" or "I just fall asleep out of no where". Fight your own inner creative battles. what do you love to do. what are you passionate about. Wher do you go when the world seems like it just disappears? What is your spot in this world and what is your territory.TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL!!! and then do what you can do naturally which is do your life's work.
Would you watch this AWESOME movie? The Cure for Insomnia?
Tsk tsk.
Probably not.*
Has anyone watched the movie ,The Cure for Insomnia ,which runs for 87 hours.?
and if so whats its storyline .
Really? There’s a movie like that?
is it possible to get a copy of the movie “the cure for insomnia” and if so where?…
Is a good cure for insomnia watching an old Ronald Regan movie?
I actually bought one a long time ago. Tried to watch it twice. I could not get past the first 15 or so minutes and even that was a chore. It was bad, very bad. Critics said he was a grade B actor, I think they were being kind.
It will either put you to sleep or put you in a coma. lol
Where to find the cure for insomnia?
My friend and I just read about the worlds longest movie “The Cure for Insomnia.” It’s like 85 hours long and we’re destined to watch this entire movie, but dont know where or if we can get it. If you know where we can rent/buy/steal this movie please let me know. And I guess just go ahead and tell us we’re lazy and we have no life and we should find something better to do for 4 days, I don’t really care.
yeah i know its just this dude reading his 4080 page poem. and its got like random inserts of heavy metal videos and x rated footage. but i’ll still watch it. if he spend over 4000 pages, the poem can’t be too crappy
Ok, first move your mouse to the corner of your internet explorer where your google search section is (or other search engine)
Type in “The Cure For Insomnia”
Most of the results will help you, me i’m off to bed because I agree with Chris!

ain's relationship with Israel increasingly fraught
source:... found New Labour to be a friendly force in an uncertain world but has been caught off-guard by the distinct new tone the Coalition is bringing to the Middle East Peace Process.
Comments best characterised as blunt have emanated from David Cameron and William Hague at regular intervals.
Israeli diplomats had expected Nick Clegg and his Liberal Democrat colleagues to provide awkward moments as the centrist party catered to its supporters views.
But the Conservatives were supposed to be different. Instead Mr Cameron visited Turkey and called Gaza a “prison camp.”
The words sent a shiver down the spines of Israeli officials, who by and large have not retorted in public, but cannot hide their disbelief.
In theory the Right-wing party should fall for the tropes of the Israel lobby just like their counterparts in America.
But the Conservatives long tradition of nurturing Britain’s historical ties to the Arab world has a firm advocate in Mr Hague.
The Foreign Secretary has close links to the Gulf and other Muslim states.
His philosophy of building ever stronger ties involves listening to his counterparts.
Their views that the region will be ridden with problems as long as peace is in abeyance in the Holy Land gets a more sincere hearing in Whitehall under Mr Hague.
For Israel this is an uncomfortable new development. It hardly helps that the Israeli government’s own strategy is to use regional unrest as a pretext for not taking the uncomfortable path of compromise with the Palestinians.
Mr Hague says Israel's “belligerent” tone is partly responsible for the faltering peace process.
Only Tony Blair now wholeheartedly reflects the Israeli point of view. His dark warnings of the rise of Muslim fundamentalists in the winds of change shaking the Middle East are the only message Israel really wants to hear from British representatives....

Yes, I know Lost is almost concluded; and here I am starting the first season. My only excuse is that I was waiting to make sure it would have a conclusion, before I got involved.
My favorite part of the show is Jack, one of the main characters, who is a surgeon. The writers seem a little confused about what kind of surgeon he is; in the first episode, he refers to having learned not to fear when dealing with a potentially catastrophic bleed during an operation on the cervical spine of a young woman. Characters who don’t like him refer to him as “the spine surgeon.” However, halfway through the season, his most serious conflict with his father, previously the chief of surgery at the same hospital Jack worked at, is revealed to be related to an incident in which his father operated while drunk on a young woman with abdominal trauma from a car accident, and Jack was forced to scrub in to help, but ultimately was unable to save the patient, due to an error his father had made. So I’m not completely sure what a spinal surgeon is doing as the pinch hitter in a trauma laparotomy; but he’s certainly very talented. Maybe he’s double boarded in general and neurosurgery. Or maybe he specializes in young female patients. . .
Apart from that, and the typical cluelessness about medical protocol (horribly incorrect CPR on multiple occasions; the OR is pitch dark; etc), this is only the second realistic TV portrayal of a doctor I’ve ever seen (the first was the murdered fiance, a cardiothoracic surgery resident, in the first season of Damages, and he was killed off, which I didn’t appreciate). And boy is it realistic. I can completely picture a doctor, and especially a surgeon, behaving exactly the way Jack does, with a hero complex obliging him to attempt to rescue every one, no matter what kind of disaster has occurred, and with a penchant for leadership which really holds the community together, although it also antagonizes some people. Also, most of his medical activities are fairly possible; supposing a plane to actually contain all the useful implement and drugs which he finds, the wilderness medicine he practices doesn’t seem too outlandish.
But the truest part is Jack’s perpetual flashbacks to medical tragedies which haunt him, and drive him on a perpetual mission not to lose another person for whom he feels responsible. I can’t believe the writers had any idea of how true this is, since even the medical dramas, with medical advisers, don’t capture it; but without being lost an a magical island, all doctors are haunted in this way, and this is the most vivid portrayal I have ever seen.

A Tap on the Glass - Vol. 53 - One More Time
Steven Wright, famous comedian and social commentator, got it correct about change when he supposedly said,
"I have a microwave fireplace at home.
You can lay down in front of the fire all night in eight minutes."
Sometimes we expect microwave fireplace results when it comes to improvement and change, not only in ourselves but at our work or in people that we interact with.
But improvement is never fast is it? It depends on putting out effort for creation and realization of new possibilities. THAT can never occur without some amount of trial and error.
Generally, I think everyone has some sort of unrealized potential. Improvement is about understanding and capturing ideas and possibilities, reworking those ideas into a usable form that makes some sense to you and then turning them into actions and behaviors. This unrealized meaning of this story. There are some wheels within wheels spinning here and some important lessons on perspective, leadership and creativity methinks.
So stop for a moment and consider the story again. I’ll wait… (whistling…)
Okay.
It may seem like what John McEnroe said on losing to Tim Mayotte in a professional indoor tennis championship:
"This taught me a lesson, but I'm not sure what it is."
I've heard the caterpillar and butterfly story a few times in the past, but had forgotten it until I had a phone call one day with MY old mentor.
What I remember from it is that people almost always "get it" as I did when I first read it.
But there is also a major paradox in the story as it applies to personal growth, managing change, and leading performance improvement. I can state it as:
It's Dangerous to think you know "The Answer."
When I first heard this story about the caterpillars and the butterfly, I assumed that it was about resistance -- a single answer. Seemed logical to me. Maybe that’s how you read it too.
And the first time I heard a room full of people talk about the meaning of the story in a training seminar, I was shocked by their answers, since most were not about my answer but focused on other themes.
- Caterpillars have no need to fly. They are well-grounded! (always a clown in the group)
-. But change will occur, inevitably.
- We can choose to be active participants in change. Or not, maybe. (?)
- We go through stages of development and butterflies are one stage closer to death. (I think this guy needs therapy)
-! (she was sitting in the corner. Go figure…)
and my favorite answer:
I'll NEVER be a butterfly; My mother was a moth.
How many times do we self-limit our perception of what is around us and our thinking because we "know the answer" and thus don't even think about considering possibilities?
I think this is a very common trait. And one deserving of some reflection and analysis. It's all about trying to look at the BIG picture and how your activities and actions affect your job and people around you. (an English Professor would slap me for that one).
- Caterpillars focus.
Our growth as an Association is rooted in the same pretext.
Now here is another paradox: YOU now have a framework that you can use with other people in the hope that they will understand this paradox of knowing the answer.
A challenge is now given to you to find a possibility of sharing this with another person and broadening some thinking.
That is the "training" part of this article -- you now have a new tool! How might you apply this to a new potential employee or student considering you?
Let's continue to illustrate my thinking on change with a few facts and another story.
- and offices everywhere.
- One moth native to South America has a foot-long proboscis that it uses to sip nectar from deep-throated flowers while another moth has a proboscis that pierces the skin and can drink the blood of animals.
Thus, we've all now learned more about caterpillars and butterflies. Can we apply it to managing issues of change?
A few years back, in a telephone conversation, Ron Frieze (my old mentor) asked me, "Do you know about caterpillars and butterflies?"
Being somewhat an expert on the subject after all my research and well aware of Ron’s penchant for dangling a hook at me, I of course said,
"No."
Ron then shared a great quote and training punch line and what makes a wonderful transition to issues of personal and organizational change.
He said:
"In the change from being a caterpillar to becoming a butterfly, you're nothing more than a yellow, gooey sticky mess." (Ron is a very deep spiritual guy when he’s sober)
We need to deal with the gooey glop that most people find uncomfortable in our day to day business of getting people into, through and out of school.
But you have to “change some type of
So, we have the sensitivity to be extremely perceptive. But we typically block our sensitivity and it goes unrealized and underutilized, just like most of our other capabilities and potential.
Applied to personal growth and change, we often limit ideas and possibilities for improvement because we already "know the answers." (ahhh…we’ve come full circle!)
And by limiting our thinking, we are limiting our possibilities that come from successful accomplishment of change and the rewards of self-improvement.
Our "beliefs" make it difficult to see what is obvious, and that prevents us from improving.
Make it a point to believe in yourself today and realize what you're capable of. Just because it’s always been done one way, doesn’t mean it’s the right way.
Be the Butterfly!

“:1-5.
Recently, I was going through some photographs and memories of my grandmother on my father’s side. She was 88 years old when she passed away in Somerset, Kentucky in 1978. I was privileged to conduct her funeral.
Among her things, I found a couple of booklets. One was by Jacob Gartenhaus; a minister of the gospel who was a converted Jew. It was on the second coming of Christ (click link). The other was a booklet distributed by her church, the Baptist Temple in Brooklyn, New York. It was What Saith the Scripture?, by John W. Aitchison. I believe these were the only two books, other than her Bibles, among her belongings she left behind.
Her family Bible was revealing in many ways. It likely was passed down from my great-great-grandmother. I probably would have much difficulty finding out my great-great-grandfather’s name had it not been for this Bible. It was a crumbling edition that dated back to the early 1800’s, but the intact family entry pages helped me immensely.
I had overlooked the other Bible, my grandmother’s personal one, until I picked it up recently. One of the passages she has marked is:
Psalm 119:9 “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.”
This touches me greatly when I remember that she often prayed for me when I was young, and I was a very wayward sinner. I was able to tell her and my maternal grandmother that both their prayers were answered in November, 1963 when I was saved at 21 years of age. Praise the Lord!
The little booklet from the Brooklyn church was enlightening in another way. It has an entry page that shows my grandmother, Lillian A. Taylor, being baptized at the Baptist Tabernacle in Atlanta in June, 1902. The pastor there was Dr. Len Broughton, a rather famous preacher, who later pastored a church in London, England. He may be best known for founding, almost single-handedly, Georgia Baptist Hospital (now Atlanta Medical Center).
Lillian, and my grandfather, Charles B. Woodruff, were married four years later on May 8, 1906. Charley, as he was called, was tragically killed in a railroad accident on October 27, 1910 when my father, Theron, was only two years old. His older brother Sam was three. Grandmother remarried a few years later to Sgt.W.C.Sievers of Kentucky, a career army man. That is how she wound up in New York for a few years. He was stationed there. I have other memories I could share, but I must move on.
In verse five of our text, Paul saw in Timothy the value of having a godly grandmother (Lois), and a godly mother (Eunice). They had a great influence on him. His faith was unfeigned (real, without hypocrisy, see Strong’s Concordance entry: Greek #505).
John R.W Stott in his commentary on 2nd Timothy titled Guard the Gospel (IVP, 1973), says on this verse: “The most formative influence on each of us has been our parentage and our home. Hence good biographies never begin with their subject, but with his parents, and probably his grandparents as well. True, no man can inherit his parents’ faith in the way that he inherits facets of their personality. But a child can be led to faith by his parents’ teaching and prayers.” (Emphasis mine)
This is true. It should both humble us, and put fear of God in us for ourselves, and our children. Oh, I know some rigid, philosophical, Calvinist will decry this “not depending on the sovereignty of God.” My friends, God is sovereign, absolutely in control of all things. Yet God says: Proverbs 22:6 “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”
Even Mr. John Calvin himself said: “Timothy was reared in his infancy in such a way that he could suck in godliness along with his mother’s milk.” (The Epistles of Paul to Timothy and Titus, p.292; John Calvin, written in 1548, quoted by Stott; op. cit.)
I was blessed to have two Christian grandmothers who set good examples for me. My maternal grandmother, Inez Biddy Smith, was also an inspiration to me. I was around her more than the other grandmother. She was not in the least shy about laying a hickory on my backside when I misbehaved either! I believe the only serious mistake she and my grandfather made was calling me a good boy! I probably wasn’t worse than other kids, until my early teenage years, and then I became plain mean! I was a sinner in need of a savior!
The Smiths were old fashioned country people from Cartersville, Georgia, who never had very much money, but they both loved their grandkids. I do remember, after I was saved, and called to preach, she liked for me to read the Bible with her. We would discuss it some. She would always listen to Brother Maze Jackson, and Brother Edgar Thomas (two well-known Georgia preachers), on the radio.
When she got bedridden, and was unable to attend church, she would often talk about going home to be with the Lord, especially after my grandfather died. We called him Big Daddy. He was a pretty big guy. He had big hands. But, somehow the name Big Mama, though that was how we knew her, was a bit incorrect. She was not a big woman, at least all the time I knew her.
In her final seven years on earth, I called her “my miracle grandmother”. You see, the doctor had given up on her, because her kidneys were bad, and other things. He called the family in. My mother and her sisters met, and decided to contact a funeral home in Acworth, Georgia to pre-arrange everything. I tried courteously to talk them into waiting, but my Aunt Judy, who handled all Big Mama’s business affairs then, insisted on planning it then.
I admit she looked bad, like “death warmed over” as we used to say. I (and I am sure others), had special prayer for her. I held her little hand. I earnestly implored the Lord not to take her yet. I knew death was coming, but I didn’t give up on her yet. We stayed, and watched, and prayed much of the night.
The next morning, there seemed to be a little improvement, but I don’t know who noticed it besides me. I was exhausted, so I went home and slept. I seem to recall that I did not return the next day because of commitments, but I checked on her. She had improved slightly. I saw her again a couple days later. She looked better. We prayed again. She told me she wanted to go to be with the Lord. I asked her to hold on a while, because we would miss her so much. Then she said, “Charles, I want you to preach my funeral.” I said “Big Mama, I would be honored, but only if you wait a while. We are not ready to send you off yet. But, God’s will be done.”
She improved day by day. In a week or so, she was able to go home, and lived seven more years! To God be the glory for her life and example! She passed away on April 8, 1988 at 84 years of age.
I preached the funeral as she requested, but a few years later than we thought! We were simply going by what the doctor had said. The sisters are all gone now, except Aunt Jessie who is 89. Mom passed away in April 2005, at 82. I want to talk about her now.
Exodus 20:12 “Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.”
My father was 36 years old when I was born. Perhaps that kept us from being closer in spirit, because when I was 13, he was 49. My mother, Vertie Lee Smith, on the other hand was young. She was only 16, nearly 17, when they married. I was born three years later, when she was 20 years old. Mom was born in 1922. I was born in 1942. Chuck, my oldest son, was born in 1962. I always thought this was interesting.
One of the earliest memories I have is going to Sunday school and morning services at Gordon Street Baptist Church in the Cascade Heights area of Atlanta. I delighted in learning Bible verses, and singing the old hymns, such as Holy, Holy, Holy, Crown Him with Many Crowns, and He keeps Me Singing. Mom always went with me, but Dad didn’t. Dad was a good provider, a good father, but Dad was a drinking man during the time I was growing up. I’ll explain how that changed later in another article.
I made a profession of faith, but, I don’t believe I was really saved at 8 ½ years old. They thought I understood, and was ready, I thought I understood and was ready, but apparently not. Anyway, I went forward, made a profession, and later was baptized. Mom had made a profession herself, and was baptized, and perhaps I just wanted to do what she did. I can’t be sure. The invitation system itself creates an atmosphere for premature professions of faith. That is just a fact. Almighty God is the only being in the universe that can tell you that you are saved. Let no man deceive you!
Let me be clear here. Even though I may not have been really convicted, and saved then, I would not discourage parents taking their children to church from infancy. I learned much during those days that was pretty sound Bible teaching. I continued to go to church regularly until my rebellious teen years. I still remember some of the teaching I received in several Atlanta Southern Baptist churches as we “moved our letters” when we located to a different area of the city.
I believe the greatest thing Mom ever did for me, was expose me to the Bible, Sunday School, and gospel preaching! The value of this in my life cannot be fully measured! But, this story is not really about me, it’s about Mom, yet as far as her relation to me, it is impossible not to say things about myself. So bear with me a little.
When I started to school in kindergarten, and the first grade, guess who walked me six blocks to school? Mother!
When I got my lip severely cut on a broken swing chain after falling out of a swing at about five years old, guess who cared for me, and took me to the doctor? Mother!
When, as a teen, I got in trouble several times, who was the main person who believed in me, and tried to help me? Mother!
Things with me got worse and worse, including burglary and car theft, and I was going to be sentenced to reform school at age15 until I was18. Who do you think pleaded with the judge, and got my school Principal, Mr. DeVaughn, at Brown High School, and my pastor, Dr. O. Norman Shands of West End Baptist Church, to write letters to the judge, stating that I was a good boy? Mother!
That was a close call, so I had a bit of a reformation. Although I quit school at 16, and left home, except for drinking and fighting, I stayed out of major trouble. No felonies, although if they had caught me bringing in Dexedrine, and other illegal drugs at the Mexican border at Tijuana in 1959, I would have likely done hard time!
I got married in January 1962 to Sandra, and our first child, Chuck, was born December14th of the same year. In early November, 1963 (about three weeks before President Kennedy was shot), I was finally saved for real at a dear Christian friend’s home. Guess who didn’t believe her ‘good boy’ needed saving? Mother!
But, she soon saw that I had indeed changed. We started going to Maranatha Baptist Church in the Bolton area of Atlanta. The pastor, Jack O. Cole, was young and a fireball. It was real different from the more staid setting in the churches we had attended when we were much younger. We were sad when Jack left after a year or so.
After a couple years of being cold in heart and unsure where to go to church, we got involved in Grace Baptist Church in the Cabbagetown area of Atlanta. This was about a mile from historic Oakland Cemetery where my Great-Great-Grandfather is buried. Garland Odom preached the gospel straight and true. He believed if God called you, God would prepare you. At Grace Baptist on March 15, 1968, I surrendered to preach the gospel. After the service Pastor Odom asked me to preach in his stead on April 7, 1968. I thought, “Oh, please God! That only gives me three weeks to prepare!” I did try to prepare. I saw a man’s tattoo in the Walgreens where I worked. It said Born to Lose! This stirred a theme in me. As natural men, we are sinners, and are born to lose, unless we are born again by God’s grace. My text was Ecclesiastes 1:2: “Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.”
I think I have preached better since then, but never more sincere. I could sense God’s presence in a special way. Mother, Dad, and my brother and sister were there. I think my grandmother was there. Some of my aunts and uncles, and cousins were there. Some of Sandra’s relatives were there. We all were in that little church in a mill village! Including regular members, it was rather crowded. There were two professions of faith, as I recall. That’s in God’s hands. But the striking thing, my mother and my dad were there! Guess who always encouraged me in my ministry after that? Mother!
Many years and many miles have passed since then. I wish I could say that Mom stayed close to God all those years. After Dad died in 1984, she quit going to church regularly. She, who had sung in the choir, and was faithful to church for a time seemed to lose interest. There were areas where I wish her life had been different. She did some things that were not right in those years. She got more materialistic. We still discussed the Bible, but it wasn’t the same.
Mom started to physically decline about ten years ago. It was Alzheimer’s. How fast that terrible disease seems to take its toll. Her memory got down to nothing. She would repeat things over and over. It got worse. Then, in October 2004, she fell and broke her hip. After that, she declined rapidly. Sadly, we had to put her in a nursing home. She developed a severe infection in March, and she died in Forsyth, Georgia on April 19, 2005. She was 82 years old. We miss her.
I always loved her and she loved me, I know. Time moves so quickly, and I have not always been where I should be with God. But God is faithful. Mom, like all of us will be, is in the hands of a just and almighty God. “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment” Hebrews 9:27.
In memory of Vertie Woodruff, Lillian Seivers, Inez Smith, and, also,
Chuck Woodruff. You all made a difference in my life! Thank God for you!

Mary, the Mother of Jesus
How could we fail to mention the mother of our Lord? The scripture says “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb” (Luke 1:42b). She is to receive honor as no other woman, but she is NOT to be worshiped! As a matter of fact, she herself worshiped the savior. She knew she was greatly honored, and blessed, and said so in the Magnificat (See Luke 1:46-55), yet she knew she was a sinner herself, and needed this savior that she bore in her own womb (verse 47). She knew she was NOT co-redeemer of the human race ready to receive our prayers and intercede on our behalf with Christ. There is nothing of this lying Popery in the word of God! Mary was a humble woman, chosen of God for the greatest motherhood of all time. She was a godly woman that all women could model after in character. She is to be honored, remembered and taught about -- but not worshiped. If she was on earth today, she would be saddened by those misguided souls who pray to her and worship her. She would point to Jesus Christ and say “worship Him who is the true savior”. (See John 14:6). She loved Him as her son, sure, but loved Him more as her “Saviour which is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11). Mary is truly the most honored mother in the Bible. The most honored mother of all time.

EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Jordan Swing scored 19 points and Preston Purifoy hit a go-ahead jumper with 51 seconds remaining as Alabama-Birmingham edged UTEP 61-60 Saturday night.
Purifoy's basket put the Blazers (9-13, 4-5 Conference USA) ahead 61-59. He was also fouled on the play but missed the free throw. Gabriel McCulley got the rebound for UTEP and was fouled but made just 1 of 2 free throws. He had tied the game at 59 on a pair of free throws with 1:02 remaining.
A missed jump shot by Swing with 9 seconds left gave the Miners (10-13, 3-6) one more chance, but Michael Perez's 3-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark.
Purifoy had 12 points for the Blazers, who were 9 for 21 on 3-point attempts. Cameron Moore added 11 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks.
UTEP got 22 points, eight rebounds and four blocks from John Bohannon, and 16 points from Julian Washburn.

Blind dates with an oenophile, financial whiz, and surgeon sounded promising. But the wino, cheapskate, and Dr. Handsy did not make for happy endings.
Perhaps you can get one at The Cinema Club.
Starting next weekend, the preview movie society will host Sunday morning screenings and discussions of on-the-verge American and foreign films at Landmark Midtown Art Cinema.
Film titles aren’t revealed until the house lights go down, so we’re in the dark about upcoming events. (If past sneak peek screenings of then-little-known flicks like Two Lovers, Slumdog Millionaire, and Then She Found Me are any indication, we’re in for a treat.)
Author and Emory film prof Matthew Bernstein moderates a postshow conversation, and anyone’s welcome to chime in.

The Baylor Bears are knotted up 14-14 with the West Virginia Mountaineers after one quarter.
Bears quarterback Nick Florence was undeterred after throwing an interception on the second play of the game. He later hit Terrence Williams across the middle, who ran it down to the Mountaineers 14 yard line for a gain of 49 yards. That set up a Jared Salubi one yard touchdown run that gave the Bears a 7-0 lead.
After holding Heisman candidate Geno Smith in check during the first drive, the Bears let the Mountaineers quarterback get loose on West Virginia's second drive. Smith led the Mountaineers on a nine play, 75 yard drive that was capped off by a Andrew Buie touchdown run.
The Bears came right back, marching down the field behind the arm of Lawrence and legs of Salubi and back up running back Glasco Martin, who scored on a seven yard run up the middle, putting the Bears up 14-0.
Smith then led the Mountaineers back down the field in less than two minutes to tie the score up on a seven yard pass to J.D. Woods.
Cornerback Demetri Goodson was seen walking to the locker room with his left arm wrapped up. There is no word yet on whether he will return to the game.

Tony Romo threw five interceptions, two of which were returned for scores, as the Dallas Cowboys lost to the Chicago Bears Monday night, 34-18.
The Dallas defense allowed Jay Cutler 275 yards and a 75 percent completion rate, but with Romo turning the ball over four times in the second half the game was quickly out of hand regardless of defensive efforts. Romo's final line on the night was 31-of-43 for 307 yards with five interceptions and one touchdown, and he was benched late in the fourth quarter in favor of Kyle Orton. Romo didn't get any help from the ground game. Demarco Murray was completely unable to get anything going and finished with 24 yards on 11 carries.
Jason Witten managed to avoid the drops that had haunted him in earlier weeks, catching 10 passes for a total of 72 yards. Only Dez Bryant had more for the Cowboys, finishing with 105 yards on eight catches.
With the loss Dallas falls to 2-2. They next head on the road to face the Baltimore Ravens, another defense likely to be a strong test for Romo.

MAN page server - suggestions please

Topic: MAN page server - suggestions please

I read a message on this forum a day or two past and it mentioned that DSL uses network MAN pages.
Then I read another message that said the network MAN server is no longer up and running.
Can I tweak a config file and point BusyBox to a different MAN page server? Or, better yet, install MAN pages on my own machine and point BusyBox there?
Thanks,
john

The internet man page server is working fine here.
The complaint had to do with the actual man page sever when a command's manpage was not found.
Originally DSL used olemiss university man page server. That server is down. If you are running old versions of DSL which still point to olemiss then no manpages are displayed.
When olemiss went missing, John decided on man.he.net, Hurricane Electric manpage server. When a command is not found on this server, it responds with an adverstiment for their ISP products.
Since DSL uses busybox most man pages are not correct for busybox, so John wrote the script to first determine if the command was a busybox and if so display a busybox man page. So it is not a striaght forward fetch and display.
If one is offended by Hurricane Electric, then change the manpage server in the script at /usr/local/bin/man.
If you are on a traditional hard drive install with gun-utils loaded then no busybox.
Also there is a manpage extension that can provide local manpages.

This program will feature six films, all ranging between three and twelve minutes in length, two of which will be presented as looped video installations, preceding & following the screening. FRAMEWORKS is proud to announce the selected films: Sleeping with Frank, Lily Baldwin. A slice of morning in Queens in which choreographed gesture reveals a potent underbelly to the lacquer of domestic normalcy.Greece Piece, Michael Bodel. World Premiere. Three tourists scramble in search of the perfect beach. Set on the island of Ios, Greece Piece is an effusive gestural approach to paradise, tourism, and loss of place in the Greek Islands.For Water, Natalie Metzger. World Premiere. A collaboration between dancers from Indonesia and America that follows a pilgrimage of five spirits to a sacred place to perform their centurial ritual for water.Story Case, Ne Barros. U.S. Premiere Story Case documents empty places and people with no history. Bodies move in and out of a charged stage environment, set to an electric guitar soloist.Gaffe, Marisa C Hayes & Franck Boulegue. U.S. Premiere. An impressionist response to NASA's gaffe in accidentally deleting documentary footage of Armstrong's first walk on the moon.Tissue Lattice, Courtney Gannone & Lindsay Wolfe. U.S. Premiere. The by-product of stealthy discomfort and distaste, where cinematic and human motions fall off-center.· Body/Traces, Sophie Kahn & Lisa Parra. This seven-minute single-channel video installation asks, "what happens to the body when it becomes a still image?" And, "what becomes of that image when it returns to motion?" Hi-tech or lo-fi, each film forges new territory in the field of dance film, capturing the power of human motion through the camera's eye. Submission is free. A rotating panel selects the films on the basis of merit and originality, regardless of their budget. FRAMEWORKS returns to DNA for its 5th screening, and will be accompanied by a new workshop series "Cinematic Gestures: Filmmaking for Choreographers" in Spring 2011. Cost: $5.00 online, $10 at the

A person asked, "What was the name of the ice cream stand on W. 21st Street in Lorain, Ohio during the 1960's and 70's? It was located just past the Westgate shopping center and on the same side of the road. It is now for sale and from the picture it looks like the name on the large cone says Dairy Twist. However, we lived nearby and patronized it often but remember the name to be Dairy Isle. Can anyone refresh my memory?"
That's a great question. I thought about it, and even though as a kid I rode my bike there a couple of times from Skyline Drive, I couldn't remember what the name was originally, or even what it was when it closed. So I dropped by the library Wednesday night to find out.
It turns out that the official name of the ice cream stand when it opened around 1971 was Westgate Dairy Isle, at least according to the city directory. It kept that name all the way up to about 1994, when it became Mr. Twister.
It's kind of interesting that whether you enjoyed eating ice cream here, or at Lorain Creamery (like my family did) you had the train tracks running right alongside for entertainment.
Anyway, in case you have a hankering to run an ice cream stand, here's the link to the real estate company that currently has the business at 2910 West 21st Street listed for sale. It comes with two Taylor Ice Cream machines and a pizza oven!

When we lived in Leavitt Homes in 1966-67, it was Dairy Isle; my favorite was the chocolate dipped cone.
Your memory's trumped my research 2 days in a row! I couldn't find it before 1971 in the books. Maybe they didn't have a phone!
I remember the Dairy Isle, but I also remember a soft serve place near where the Arthur Treachers was and they had the best soft serve. We lived on Meister Rd and my dad used to take me there.
Anyone remember that place?

but all in all, the reason this blog became what is it today was pretty much because of this resolution, and last sunday i completed yet another year of what i had set out to do on january 1st. (if you dont recall, i gave up potato chips for my n.y.r. of 2009. dumb, dumb, dumb. that has completely backfired on me as i now go through at least a mini bag of chips per day. no joke.)
will this blog end here and now? HA! weve still got a wedding to get through... 22 days!!! i couldnt (& wouldnt!) leave ya’ll hangin like that! and ive got some fun plans coming for next year. i think ill stick around.
so without further adieu (ive never used that word before... figured id start now), here is my ultimate "12 in 2010" review… the good, the bad, and something i learned from each race. ive also added the link to the race recap report incase you have any interest in seeing more pics and randomness from each race.
january- frozen 5k 23:54 (7:42)
date/time/weather: 1/10/10, 1:30pm, 20 degrees… really freaking cold, oh and there was wind too. wind is so awesome.
the good: an afternoon race! got to sleep in. always a plus.
the bad: 20 degrees. wind. enough said.
something i learned: sprinting in freezing temps does not allow for quality breathing but it does mean you wont be out running in the cold as long.
one lonely tshirt just waiting for some friends...
february- mid winter classic 10 miler 1:26:08 (8:37)
date/time/weather: 2/7/10, 9:45am, 11 degrees… miserable.
the good: does anyone else run 10 miles the morning of the superbowl? allows for extra beers and chicken wings with no added guilt.
the bad: little to no sleep the night before (i ended up on the couch watching kardashian reruns at 2am), wind, ankle bracelet timing chips. its 2010 right? get with the newer technology thanks.
something i learned: this race had a huge impact on me (i didnt PR, down to the very second of my previous race). it helped me realize not getting a PR was insignificant and not to take anything in my life for granted.
thats maine talk for "hardcore". this moose knew whats up.
march- irish road rover 5k 30:38 (9:53)
date/time/weather: 3/7/10, 11:00am, sunny & on the warmer side for march in maine
the good: the weather was awesome, ty ran with me, aaaand we all went out for beers post race! cant go wrong with that combination.
the bad: i found nothing bad about this race. i asked ty what he thought was bad about this race: "all of it". he really loves running.
something i learned: i dont hate 5k’s as much when im not running them in an all out sprint
am i irish? nope. is it still fun to wear cute shamrock socks obviously.
april- great bay half marathon 1:58:15 (9:02)
date/time/weather: 4/11/10, 11:00am, 64 degrees. warmer than i thought it was going to be (apparently i thought 64 was cold)
the good: this is a truly beautiful and challenging course
the bad: trying to take off a long sleeve compression shirt while running… with a tshirt over it… holding a handheld and wearing a belt… not easy
something i learned: i have a love hate relationship with my handheld
usually i hate my monster manlike calves... but i actually like this pic
may- sugarloaf marathon 4:15:25 (9:49)
date/time/weather: 5/16/10, 7:00am, mid 40’s at start, warmed up to 60's, sunny
the good: my training. i worked hard for this PR and it showed.
the bad: no expo, waiting too long to book hotel room so we ended up in what i can only imagine resembled a retro bomb shelter, waiting 2 hours for dinner, and 16 miles downhill…. holy quad thrasher!
something i learned: apply a lot of sun block on your legs if youre going to run a marathon on a sunny day with KTtape… the tan lines arent cool. also no matter how much you train, a mile 20 breakdown/wall can and will still occur whether youre ready or not
a 26.2 mile advertisement
june- close to the coast 10k 49:44 (8:01)
date/time/weather: 6/12/10, 9:00am, warm, humid & muggy
the good: um... well... yeah, i got nothing. the race was pretty well organized, i met up with my friend betsy and got to meet her little boy :)
the bad: unable to pace myself, trail running, wood chips.
something i learned: i am not a trail runner
july- llbean 10k 52:21 (8:26)
date/time/weather: 7/4/10, 7:30am, so FREAKING HOT!
the good: andreas race photo taken by sarah (see below) and jake getting a PR. there was nothing good about this race from my racing point of view.
the bad: a pace of 16:45, yeah that’s walking.
something i learned: even though i live by my own rules, i dont often make the best choices. changing up breakfast, new shoes on race day, different pre-race fuel... not recommended
hoooooooooooottttttttttttttttttt
august- beach to beacon 10k 49:47 (8:01)
date/time/weather: 8/7/10, 8:05am, 49 degrees before the start (the two previous days were in the 90’s. gotta love maine!)
the good: probably the most beautiful/scenic race in the world! (ok thats probably not entirely true since i havent gotten out much, but its MY most beautiful race)
the bad: nothing. i heart this race. well attempting to register for the race is a royal pain. when asking ty what he thought was bad about this race, he said "all of it". see a theme here people? (see pic below)
something i learned: how to pee in the woods pre race. crucial.
ty (green shirt) was so excited. cant you tell?
september- reach the beach 200 mile relay 28:51:27
date/time/weather: 9/17-18/10, all night long baby, rain, sun, wind, cold, hot… you name it
the good: running in the middle of the night through wooded backroads with a head lamp, the white church with the old ladies making homemade chili, giddy middle school sleep over esque behavior in the van, chasing white new balance vans for silly bands. this list could go on and on...
the bad: the car top carrier opening up on the highway, scattering all our belongings all over the road… and having to leave early. sad.
something i learned: no matter how many times you say “ok guys im REALLY gonna try to fall asleep now”, it aint gonna happen. and i really hate port-a-potties.
stolen from reach the beach photos.
october- maine marathon 4:43:30 (10:49)
date/time/weather: 10/3/10, 7:45am, 46 degrees
the good: i love this marathon. love, love, love it.
the bad: i didnt train properly. i nearly got heat stroke on an 18 mile training run. marathon personal worst time. (but really, i love this marathon.)
something i learned: not training for a marathon will not kill you, but it is something i also do not recommend
did i just run almost 5 hours or did i BQ? you'd be surprised.
november- turkey trot 5k 24:18 (7:50)
date/time/weather: 11/21/10 9:00am, brrrrr chilly and windy
the good: getting together with good friends and kevin mitchell at the finish line handing out water
the bad: another stupid ankle bracelet for timing and no starting mat (gun time only)
something i learned: hills during mile 3 are not my friend
im moving so fast i made the pic blurry! no, not really. camera fail.
december- jingle bell 5k (actually 2.9miles) 21:42 (7:00)
date/time/weather: 12/5/10, 10:00am, 34 degrees
the good: a 5k race thats not accurately a 5k is still an official 5k online... right?
the bad: the course was about 0.2 miles short
something i learned: my final race of my new years resolution... i can do anything i set my mind to, just takes determination, dedication, and heart. ill never forget this year, and i couldnt have done it without the support of all my family and friends. thank you!!
thats the smile of accomplishment, folks
so there you have it. many people have asked if im going to do this again next year... simple answer: no. did i have fun? absolutely... thats not it at all. i set out to accomplish a goal and i did it. there were mornings i didnt feel like running a race, as there usually is. i want to do different things next year and that will be just fine with me. do i recommend what i did to others? for sure. be it with races of mixed distances like i did, triathlons, half marathons, or even 12 marathons in 12 months... its a fun thing to set out and feels really good to accomplish it. go for it.
on top of the 12 races in this resolution, i ran 8 other races as well: psychic prediction 5k, polar bear triathlon relay 5k, trail to ale 5k, 65 roses 5k, maine coast womens half marathon, loco moose 5k, thankgiving 4 miler, and coming up on 12/26 ill be running 6.1 miles with a team of awesome mainah's supporting operation jack & train4autism (sign up here, k thanks).

Joey deVilla, defending Microsoft’s “Future Visions” concept video:
As you might expect, Jon [sic] .
DeVilla isn’t the only one who accused me of Apple-biased hypocrisy regarding my stance on Microsoft’s “Future Visions” vs. Apple’s “Knowledge Navigator”. It is true that when I linked to Andy Baio’s post about “Knowledge Navigator” a few weeks ago, I didn’t add any commentary.
But the exact same criticism I have for Microsoft today applies to 1987 Apple. “Knowledge Navigator” encapsulates everything that was wrong with Apple in 1987. Their coolest products were imaginary futuristic bullshit. The mindset and priorities of Apple’s executive leadership in 1987 led the company to lose what was then an enormous usability and user experience lead over the rest of the industry, and eventually drove the company to the precipice of bankruptcy. That 1987 Apple was a broken company is so painfully obvious from today’s vantage point that I didn’t think it needed to be mentioned.
“Knowledge Navigator” didn’t help Apple in any way. Apple never made such a product. It didn’t bring Siri to us any sooner than if that video had never been made. It only served to distract from and diminish Apple’s then-current actual products.
“We’re like Apple in 1987” is not a badge of honor — it’s a flashing red warning light.
Apple today, from a strategic and operational perspective, is nothing like Apple of 1987. Apple today would never release to the public a concept video speculating on what sort of products they might be making 10 or 20 years from now. The attention of the public and the media is a rare and precious commodity. Apple today uses what attention it gets to focus on actual new products, ones that you can go out and actually buy and use.
Apple today is a company that, several times a year, every year, releases new products that millions of people literally line up to buy the first day they’re available. Apple in 1987 was a company that began work on the Newton, a product that nobody ever had to wait in line to buy. The Newton was a brilliant design and full of terrific industry-leading ideas. And it struck the market like a wet match.
I’m not lambasting Microsoft just because they’re Microsoft (or because they’re not-Apple), and I’m not praising today’s Apple just because it’s Apple and even when Apple farts I proclaim that it smells like roses. I praise Apple for its successes, which are undeniable.
Putting this “Future Visions” video in public squanders attention that Microsoft could otherwise have focused on its current and imminent new products — like Windows Phone. Take a new iPhone 4S and a Windows Phone 7.5 device back in time 20 years and they might seem equally impressive to a pair of 1991 eyes. But one of them sold more in a weekend than the other does in an entire financial quarter. Is not Windows Phone scarily similar to the Newton? Innovative design, much to praise — and but striking the market like a wet match?
DeVilla writes:.
That sure helped Sculley-era Apple.
DeVilla then cites old examples from Sun and AT&T. Sun went out of business, and AT&T never accomplished anything in their concept video. Not a damn thing..
1987 Apple didn’t have that focus. 2011 Apple does. Only one of those Apples releases futuristic concept videos. But you know who else does release futuristic concept videos today? RIM. Great company.

I nightmares I still have and occasional anxiety attacks are not unique to me. There are many… many who have been through the same and are going through it now. There is a way to come out of it and find the light at the end of the tunnel. That is partly why I blog. I want people to know that they are not alone, but also that you can have a life after. Sure, you may have set backs and it never truly disappears from your past, but even survivors have multi-faceted lives. They can embrace family, sex, work, parenting, and everything else that makes us who we are even after going through so much.
However, this one time I saw “violence against women” or VAW, something occurred to me. It is a simplistic thought, but it was profound to me. You would never see someone saying let’s stop violence against men or against the middle class or against… almost any other population subgroup. There are of course exceptions, but never as something as general and all-embracing as violence. There is stop cruelty against animals, but even cruelty seems fairly specific. Like we all know, as good human beings, that to be cruel to animals is to be a bad person. And, there is stop discrimination, which could include violence. But, it is also a given that those who discriminate are bigots. They are wrong in society’s eyes. Child abuse is the same.
Violence against women though seems like this large unwieldy mass of incidents and events. Even I, who have been on the punching bag end of the spectrum, would never categorically think of someone as inhuman or a bad person, if they have participated in violence against women. Yes, I know, that’s awful. However, the reason I cannot is because it would include just such a large percentage of the population, especially the male population. Women, we are not supposed to be a victimized population, in these times of feminism and women excelling in all areas of our society. But, we are. The numbers are staggering. We are violated, trampled upon and demoralized. Yet, we are supposed to be successful. We are supposed to be a large voice of the American population. We are supposed to be strong and independent.
Is this true though? How can such juxtaposition exist? For how much longer can violence against women be ingrained in our society as an often overlooked norm. Can that reality coexist with the rise of powerful women? Something has got to give. It has been this way for quite a long time, and I am afraid, especially with the legislature’s refusal to renew the Violence Against Women Act that when this comes to a head, the societal norm will win out. It is what we are used to. It is the existence we were born into. It needs to stop now. This is the time where we can make a difference and change the lives of our daughters and granddaughters. It is now that we will be able to turn the tide in the favor of equality for women not just in the board room, but in the bedroom as well.
This seems like such a strange shift from the feminist rhetoric of the past, demanding equal pay for equal work. But, maybe it is time to start demanding equal value in the eyes of all the men in our lives – fathers, brothers, husbands, neighbors, and friends. It is those men who decide on our behalf the lives we will lead – if it will be one lived in fear or one lived in happiness. For, it is not the women who bring this upon themselves, but the men who decide to perpetrate such acts. It is time for many in our country to stop blaming women for what violence is done to them. If a car ran into a tree, you would blame the driver, not the branches. If a man beats his dog, you do not say the dog should have done something differently. So, why as a society do men and women alike still look to the victim for the answer as to why they were victimized? This is something we need to change.
What are you doing to change this? And, what are the men in your life doing to change this as well?

Archive for the ‘Craigend Street’ tag
Take it home and see if it works: Toilet
When you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go.
We spotted this loo a couple of weeks ago, on Craigend Street, at the corner of Surrey Street.
You could take it home and see if it works, or you could just find out on the spot if the urge was that great.
Romantic robot
We noticed this lonely looking robot at the end of the right-angled cul-de-sac, Little Surrey Street, several days ago.
We snapped a photo, naturally, but didn’t quite get around to doing anything more. That is, until Kym Chapple tweeted another robot sighting in the neighbourhood.
He – has to be a he, right? – is on the corner of Craigend Street and Oswald Lane.
There’s something I like about robots in love. It’s part of the reason I love Mari Velonaki‘s beautiful robotic creations, could be the relic of a childhood reading Asimov novels. Whatever, I like it. More romantic robots.
Chalk alphabet – updated
The mystery continues. More chalk on the walls in Darlinghurst.
These were picked up by Allie Townsend. They’re hard to read because of the light, but both are on Craigend Street, the photo on the left is on the corner of Surrey Street.
So to recap, we now have:
A is for “azimuth”
C is for “cephlapod”
D is for “diatribe”
E is for “entropy”
F is for “fiasco”
G is for “gyroscope”
K is for “kibosh”
M is for “modulate”
N is for “nebulous”
T is for “thought bubble”
Y is for “yesterday”
Z is for “zipper”
Anagram, riddle, random inspiration?
An update: Sushi Yachiyo
We last posted about the pending opening of Japanese place, Sushi Yachiyo, back in May 2009.
Well, the location is yet to prove itself un-haunted as we are still waiting for the doors to open for business.
It must be soon though, as I noticed take-away menus affixed to the door, with a voucher for free edamame, when walking past yesterday.
And this morning, a workman was busy inside, before 7am.
Haunted corner
I walk past a building on the corner of Craigend Street and Kirketon Road in Darlinghurst most days. It has an intricate facade, and a seemingly perfect location overlooking Kings Cross and the city.
Yet it’s played host to a string of bars and restaurants, including the lamented Global Burgers. You might see a shadow of old vomit too.
Haunted, cursed, bad feng shui?
In the buzz following Clover Moore’s liquor licensing changes, a DA went through to open ‘Lotus Wine Bar’ downstairs. Seems like such a cool location. It was going to be a seven day a week, 11am to 3am place. But less than two months later, in August, the $75,000 proposal was withdrawn.
Background 10/12/08
Prompted by Scot’s comment below, I checked out the background for Dale Jones-Evans’s intriguing (and, in 2004, award winning) building. It’s all here.
As the architect and developer I imagined a precious, gritty little building exploding out of this tiny, Tokyo-like, 7 x 15 metre, forgotten site. A commercial redevelopment appeared more suitable to the intense nodal semiology of the Kings Cross circus, William Street Boulevard, the corner condition; the urbanity of traffic-tunnel-signage and the general prevalence of human lunacy.
I think the Emily Kame Kngwarreye work’s gone though. Anyone know when/where?.

My current project is related to Accessibility. Certain parts of the accessibility modules will help me and are being tested.
One requested idea is to make use of a 5 button mouse. By default the 5 button mouse works per the defaults: Thumb1 does a Back, and Thumb2 does a Forward.
The special need that we have is to eliminate the need to use the keyboard in combination with the Left mouse button. I'm trying to map it like this:
Thumb1 = Hold_Shift_L + Regular_Left_Mouse_Button + Release_Shift_L
Thumb2 = Hold_Control_L + Regular_Left_Mouse_Button + Release_Control_L
This would let them make non-continuous selections and shifted selections without the keyboard. It seems like imwheel is the closest software package for this purpose, but it seems incapable of sending a physical mouse click after another mouse click. Can anyone confirm this is true?
What I tried in the .imwheelrc file is this:
".*"
#,Thumb1,H|E|L|L|O
,Thumb1, Shift_L|Left|-Shift_L
The commented line works great, click Thumb1 and the string appears in the current window. You also can issue a Control-A to select all, works great. But when you attempt to simulate a mouse click, it doesn't seem to understand how to do that. The line below the commented line above to me should work, but doesn't work. I also tried Button8 instead of Left and that also does not work.
Anyone know of another program or technique that could provide this functionality?
Thanks!

Me and my friend were arguing about an issue similar to this! Now I know that I was right. lol! Thanks for the information you post

Another day when the phone won't stop ringing from correspondents because of a newly reported project involving language. This time it's the so-called Culturomics project, reported on 16 December in the journal Science and picked up in a half-chewed state by several newspapers and radio stations today.
What has happened is that a team of researchers have collaborated with Google Books to present a corpus of nearly 5.2 million digitized books, which they think is around 4 per cent of all published books. The corpus size is 500 billion words, 361 billion being English (the others from six languages - French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Russian, Hebrew). The time frame is 1800 to 2000. This is now available for online searching, and there's a site where you can type in your own words or word-sets and see how they have developed over time. There is a report on the project here. The full report can be read in the journal Science, though you have to register first.
The name culturomics is an odd one, presumably based on ergonomics, economics, and suchlike. They define it as 'the application of high-throughput data collection and analysis to the study of human culture'. Most people in this business I imagine would normally talk of 'cultural history' or 'cultural evolution'. The language side of the project is familiar, as an exercise in historical corpus linguistics. The new term may catch on, as it blends the two notions (culture and language) in a novel way. We'll just have to wait and see.
The news reports have homed in on an analogy the authors make in their paper. They say: 'The corpus cannot be read by a human. If you tried to read only the entries from the year 2000 alone, at the reasonable pace of 200 words/minute, without interruptions for food or sleep, it would take eighty years. The sequence of letters is one thousand times longer than the human genome'. This has led to such headlines as 'Cultural genome project mines Google Books for the secret history of humanity' or (in today's Guardian) 'Google creates a tool to probe "genome" of English words for cultural trends'. But it isn't anything like the human genome, which is the complete genetic account of an individual. Culture doesn't work in that way. The authors themselves don't use the phrase in their paper, and rightly so.
We mustn't exaggerate the significance of this project. It is no more than a collection of scanned books - an impressive collection, unprecedented in its size, and capable of displaying innumerable interesting trends, but far away from entire cultural reality. For a start, this is just a collection of books - no newspapers, magazines, advertisements, or other orthographic places where culture resides. No websites, blogs, social networking sites. No spoken language, of course, so over 90 percent of the daily linguistic usage of the world isn't here. Moreover, the books were selected from 'over 40 university libraries from around the world', supplemented by some books directly from publishers - so there will be limited coverage of the genres recognized in the categorization systems used in corpus linguistics . They were also, I imagine, books which presented no copyright difficulties. The final choice went through what must have been a huge filtering process. Evidently 15 million books were scanned, and 5 million selected partly on the basis of 'the quality of their OCR' [optical character recognition]. So this must mean that some types of text (those with a greater degree of orthographic regularity) will have been privileged over others.
It's still an impressively large sample, though. So what can we look for? To begin with, note that this is culture not just lexicology. No distinction is made between dictionary and encyclopedia. Anything that is a string of letters separated by a space [a 1-gram, they call it] can be searched for - including names of people, places, etc. They also searched for sequences of two strings (2-grams) and so on up to five [5-grams]. Only items which turned up more than 40 times in the corpus are displayed. So, to take one of their example, we can search for the usage of 'the Great War' [NB the searches are case sensitive], which peaks in frequency between 1915 and 1941, and for 'World War I', which then takes over. Note that, to achieve a comprehensive result, you would have to repeat the search for orthographic variations (eg 'The' for 'the' or '1' for 'I'].
A huge problem in doing this kind of thing is punctuation. I know, because I had to deal with it when carrying out a very similar string-related project in online advertising a few years ago. You have to deal with all the ways in which a punctuation mark can interfere with a string - 'radio' is different from 'radio,' for example. The culturonomists have collapsed word fragments at line-endings separated by a hyphen - though there's a problem when a non-omissible hyphen turns up at a line break. And they have treated punctuation marks as separate n-grams - so 'Why?' for example, is treated as 'Why' + '?'. They don't give details of their procedure, but it doesn't seem to work well. I searched for 'Radio 4', for example. The trace showed the usage taking off in the 1970s, as it should, but there were many instances shown before that decade. I found examples listed in the 1930s. How can that be? There was no Radio 4 then. When you click on the dates to see the sources, you find such instances as 'stereo with AM/FM radio, 4 speakers' and 'RADIO 4-INCH BLADE'.
The other big problem is homographs - words which look the same but which have different meanings. This is the biggest weakness in software which tries to do linguistic analysis, and it was the primary focus of the ad project I mentioned above. A news page which reported a street stabbing had ads down the side which read 'Buy your knives here'. The software had failed to distinguish the two senses of 'knife' (cutlery, weapons), and made the wrong association between text and ad inventory. I solved it by developing a notion of semantic targetting which used the full context of a web page to distinguish homographs. The Culturomics project has to solve the same problem, but on a larger scale (books rather than pages), and there is no sign that it has yet tried to do so. So, type 'Apple', say, into their system and you will see a large peak in the 1980s and 1990s - but is this due to the Beatles or the Mac? There's no way of knowing.
The approach, in other words, shows trends but can't interpret or explain them. It can't handle ambiguity or idiomaticity. If your query is unique and unambiguous, you'll get some interpretable results - as in their examples which trace the rise and fall of a celebrity (eg Greta Garbo, peaking in the 1930s). But even here one must be careful. They show Freud more frequent than Einstein, Galileo, and Darwin, and suggest that this is because he is 'more deeply engrained in our collective subconscious' thanks to such everyday phrases as 'Freudian slip'. But which Freud is being picked up in their totals? They assume Sigmund. But what about Lucian, Clement, Anna...?
Linguists will home in on the claims being made about vocabulary growth over time. Evidently their corpus shows 544K words in English in 1900, 597K in 1950, and 1022K in 2000, and claim that around 8500 words a year have entered English during the last century (though of course only some achieve a permanent presence). These totals are pointing in the right direction, avoiding the underestimates that are common (and incidentally showing yet again how absurd that claim was a year ago about the millionth word entering English). The real figures will of course be much higher, once other genres are taken into account.
They point out that their totals far exceed the totals in dictionaries, and - one of the most interesting findings reported - say that over half the words in their corpus (52%) are what they call 'lexical dark matter'. These are words that don't make it into dictionaries, because they are uncommon, and dictionaries focus on recording the higher frequency words in a language. Their figure is probably a bit high, as (as mentioned above) this project includes proper names as well as nouns, and nobody would want to say that knowledge of proper names is a sign of linguistic ability. (I am reminded of the old Music Hall joke: 'I say, I say, I say, I can speak French'. 'I didn't know you could speak French. Let me hear you speak French.' 'Bordeaux, Calais, Nice...')
This 'cultural observatory' has given us a fascinating tool to play with, and some interesting discoveries will come out of it, especially when one types competing usages into the Ngram Viewer, such as the choice between alternative forms of a verb (eg dreamed/dreamt). There's nothing new about this, of course, as other corpora have done the same thing; but the scale of the enterprise makes this project different (though limited by its academic library origins). For instance, I typed in 'actually to do' and 'to actually do' to see whether there is a trend in the increasing usage of the split infinitive, and there certainly is, with a dramatic increase since 1980. The spelling of 'judgment' without an 'e' has been steadily falling since the 1920s, with the form with an 'e' having a stronger presence in British English [it is possible to search separately for British and American English]. Enough, already. As with all corpora, it gets addictive.

Fascinating, especially about the semantic links. It often amuses me that if I write a humorous blog post about, say, motherhood, in which I advocate all kinds of unacceptable practices (ironically, of course) to keep a baby quiet, serious ads will pop up as soon as I publish, offering me babycare products. The sudden appearance of these ads always give me a laugh.
Good post that highlights some of the weaknesses with the culturomics analysis, that being said, some of the issues your raise are, in my opinion, non-issues.
“They don't give details of their procedure, but it doesn't seem to work well.” The method is very painfully detailed in the supplementary material of the paper, which is freely available on the Science journal website.
“There's no way of knowing.” Although approximate, you can use the snippets provided from the Google Books search to estimate how many hits in a given year represent The Beatles or the Mac.
“They assume Sigmund. But what about Lucian, Clement, Anna...? “ Their assumption makes sense in the light of the relative importance of the 2grams, (see). Furthermore, the 1-gram name analysis was not a part of the paper per se, only of the half chewing, as you so well put it.
The name culturomics is an odd one, presumably based on ergonomics, economics, and suchlike.
No, it's based on genomics, which has spawned various other X-omics.
Thanks for these clarifications.

Based on genome... Not the most felicitous choice of a term, it seems to me. It's bound to lead to confusion, as morphologically this ending has a short vowel, and that's how people will automatically say it.

Here is my drama: Top Chef Las Vegas premieres on Wednesday (8/19). Project Runway premieres the next evening. WHAT SHOULD I RECAP?!? And you're not allowed to say "both".
Seriously, I need your.
17 comments:
Oy. Hmmm, well I guess cause TLo recaps PR and not Top Chef and I would love at least one hilarious recap of each show, I vote for Gail's Boobies!
Recap PR and do a short commentary on TC and let everyone comment. Or you could choose to recap the one with the best material each week and post a short commentary on the other one.
I could be a life coach.
Oh, that cat is perfect!
oh project runway please, and rename the cast with funny monikers thx xx
my dream-wish-fantasy is both, but since i MUST choose, i choose PR of course.
Damn, now that you have a life, you have become so difficult....JK!!!.
LB anon
I vote PR, too.
Project Runway! Just because... it's been so long.
In a perfect world you would clone yourself in time to recap both.....who will provide the snark? Follow your bliss and recap whichever one suits your fancy!
I like Joy's idea. And Natasha wants to know where her check is since you used her likeness here.
Are you kidding? Much as I LURVE your Top Chef recaps and much as I LOL every time THE BOOBIES make an appearance, it's gotta be Project Runway, baby. Love ya, mean it.
Oh, dear! I would have to vote for PR as I agree with Lelio, it has been so long since the last PR. But do throw in a comment on Gail's boobies once in a while...
PROJECT RUNGAY!!! PROJECT RUNGAY!!!! PROJECT RUNGAY!!!!
ok, now that I have that outta my system...please recap PR...you are madly fabulous at it.
and I hope Lifetime doesn't take out all the gay...ya know?
PR. I'm sorry, I just couldn't get into TCM. I mean, without Gail's boobies and Padma's scar and all...
Why can't I say both? I say both. Do both. Give up your life, take a vow of recapping and go to it.
Maybe you could sort of combine them. Yeah, a Project Top Chef mashup. Tim Gunn in a toque and no pants. I have to go lie down now.
I say : "DO AS JOY COMMANDS!!!!"
XOXOXOXOXOX
Your Project Runway recaps are LEGENDARY - you MUST recap it.

COVER STORY: J.K. Rowling for grown-upsNovember 11, 2012 by dawnbooksandauthors
Reviewed by Sheheryar Sheikh
The Harry Potter series has sold over 450 million books, and has been translated into 73 languages. Upon learning that J.K. Rowling would soon come out with a novel for adults, I was eagerly waiting to see what she could come up with after taking a sharp turn away from material that had brought her such astounding success. Having now read The Casual Vacancy cover to cover in three sittings, I am convinced that this is the book I was waiting for her to write.
The entire narrative of The Casual Vacancy takes place within two adjacent rural towns in England: Pagford and Yarvil. Of these, the more residential Pagford is a haven that was once pristine and untainted by council housing (read poor people’s accommodations), but has since been infiltrated by an estate where families on welfare dwell.
At the beginning of the novel, Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Pagford Parish Council, suffering from a two-day headache, dies suddenly of an aneurism. This leaves open his seat on the council, and tears into the social fabric of the town. Barry was perhaps the only universally liked character in both Pagford and Yarvil. A link between families and between the haves and have-nots in the two towns, he leaves behind not just his widow Mary and their four children, but also those that counted him as a role model, best friend, coach, or even the secret love of their lives. All these bonds come untethered with Barry’s death.
Three people decide to stand for election as Barry’s successor on the Pagford Parish Council. The power of the council extends to zoning the town’s territories, and the major decision of whether or not to keep the council estates within Pagford will come up for voting soon. Miles Mollison wants to be elected to add power to his father Howard Mollison’s idea of reworking the zones so as to kick out the council estates from Pagford into Yarvil. This would mean that Yarvil, not Pagford, will bear the brunt of generating the income that goes to support families on welfare in the council estates.
But the deceased Barry was opposed to rezoning, and the local high school principal Colin Wall wants to be voted in so he can fulfil Barry’s vision. The last candidate, Simon Price, wants to win the election because he thinks he can fill his pockets with bribes once he is on the council. All candidates are Pagford people who haven’t tasted poverty themselves, whereas Barry was born in the council estates and raised himself out of that den of hopelessness to make a future for himself and to give hope to those still stuck there.
While the election hovers in the background like a reverberating piano note, there is much more to the novel than just these principal candidates and the eventual outcome of the vote. Rowling ties together the families of these towns into a claustrophobic web. There is hardly any degree of separation between the characters that are linked in multiple ways and display complex loyalties. For instance, Barry’s main opponent Howard’s doctor is Parminder, who counted Barry as her best friend. Also, everyone drops by Howard’s deli-café in town, even though they may be at loggerheads on the council estates issue. Simon’s son, Andrew, even begins working at the café, despite Simon and Howard facing off in the election.
The tourniquet-like pressure on the narrative keeps building as the elections come closer, reaching several crescendos before the last major one. Children, in fits of rage, put up notices on the council’s website against their parents — anonymous notes that shout out their parents’ darkest secrets. And the women form their own layers of diplomatic negotiations, with tensions escalating to the likeness of a shrill shriek at some dinner parties.
The couples have tussles for power and intimacy. There are some secret affairs that fuel small-town gossip, as in real life. But the most interesting parts of Rowling’s commentary on adults are her dissections of marriages. Consider this one paragraph that exemplifies her skill with the pen:
.”
Rowling writes most of the adults well, but the book’s best segments are when she is describing what the three principal teenagers are going through. Surely seven Harry Potter books play into her heightened capacity for understanding the teenage years and portraying them well. In this for-adults novel though, the psyches of her characters are darker, more realistic, and not prone to supernatural escapes from their dangerous explorations.
When we first meet one of the principle teenagers, the candidate Simon’s son, this is what we learn about him: “That’s wise, thought Andrew, with furious contempt; that’s profound. So it was Barry Fairbrother’s own fault his brain had burst open. You self-satisfied f***er, Andrew told his father, loudly, inside his own head.” That’s how rebellious teens behave when they want to dissemble. But Rowling’s got their number.
The situations that Krystal, a council estate teenager, is exposed to are harrowing, and cannot come up in any children’s book. Raised by a neglectful drug-addict mother, Krystal is the one thing keeping both her mother and her baby brother out of foster care or prison. With a filthy mouth and promiscuous habits, she becomes a link between the bleakness of the council estates and the privileged class that calls Pagford home.
Krystal was among those who counted on Barry as her mentor. He was her rowing team’s coach, and now that he is dead, her hope — and hope for her — is disappearing fast.
There has been some criticism of the pessimism in the novel. In her quest to depart from writing for children, Rowling may just have written the bleakest possible work she could. Despite its fleeting moments of pure delight for characters that do strike a sympathetic chord, there is little to cheer about in this novel. The darkness is what resounds. Another imperfection is the narrator’s moralising tone. It may read well enough for fans of her previous fiction, but it can appear condescending in a literary novel for adults.
Overall, the gripping narrative, with its several high points, including beautiful use of language, is a worthy read. The Casual Vacancy should figure among the best books of the year. J.K. Rowling, the writer for grown-ups, has arrived.

In Barcelona on Tuesday, Team USA faced off against the Spanish National Team that gave them a scare in the gold medal game of the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing. But the game wouldn't be as close as the Americans defeated the Spaniards, 100-78.
Carmelo Anthony led the way with 27 points off the bench, including 23 first half points to help secure the victory. LeBron James pumped in 25 points and Kevin Durant helped break the game open by scoring 10 of his 13 points in the first three minutes of the third quarter.
For Spain, they were led by Los Angeles Lakers star Pau Gasol who scored 19 points, and Oklahoma City Thunder big man Serge Ibaka -- who became a Spanish national last year -- who contributed 16 points in the loss.
Stick with SB Nation DC!

UPDATE: Now with a GIF, via Japers' Rink user dimagus.
The goal by Jason Chimera during the Washington Capitals' 4-3 win over the Carolina Hurricanes was great in one respect and a little hilarious in another. How was it great, you ask? Look at Chimera's speed getting past the Hurricanes defenders and getting in on Hurricanes goalie Brian Boucher.
How was it hilarious, you ask? Well, it wasn't exactly the cleanest shot in the world. As you watch the very end of this video, notice how it barely slips over Boucher's shoulder and drops into the net. Boucher looks so confused because he has no idea where the puck actually is. Eventually, the puck landed behind Boucher, and everyone paused for a beat before celebrating.
It looked like this goal would end up being decisive. It wasn't, of course, because both teams scored two goals after that. Here's the video below the jump, from our friends at CSN Washington.

Friday Spotlight with Kay Dee Royal (and Lacinda)
One of my favourite people on the webisphere is stepping under the Spotlight today with a super fun post. In addition, Kay will offer up some info, an excerpt and a FREE copy of her contemporary erotic romance One Plus One!
Kay Dee Royal, welcome to the e-rotica blog! Thank you for stepping under the Friday Spotlight.
Hello D.C., thank you so much for inviting me in to hang out for the day. Love your place…really feels like home
Oh, I should probably introduce myself…
Hi everyone, I’m Kay Dee Royal, an erotic romance author who writes what I love, paranormal, fantasy, and contemporary erotic romance. I’m here today with Lacinda, the heroine of One Plus One, my latest contemporary erotic romance. I’ve brought her along to explain in her own words how she ended up on a singles cruise ship;)
*Lacinda coughs, blushes, and stares at the floor*
Kay Dee: You’re okay with sharing this, right?
Lacinda: Well, it’s terribly embarrassing…and feels a bit humiliating to say it out loud.
Kay Dee: We’d all love to hear what you did to get on that ship, Lacinda. Please share it with us.
Lacinda: *looks up and takes a deep breath, face even brighter red* Okay, it might be considered quite immature by some, and I wouldn’t blame them. It was Avery, my best friend’s idea. She came over one night with a bottle of wine and a survey questionnaire…
Kay Dee: Yeah, go on, what kind of survey?
Lacinda: She told me it was just some silly thing she’d found…she’d been insistent on coming over to fill this thing out for a couple days. I knew she’d been worried about me, not having a man in my life, and it drove her crazy. So, I agreed to do this as a bargaining chip for her to leave me alone about men afterwards.
Kay Dee: Sounds like a good caring friend. (LOL) So, did you fill it out?
Lacinda: After a couple huge glasses of wine, yes, we had fun with it. Avery told me it was an anonymous survey describing intimacy…in full graphic detail. She kept prodding me to use my imagination and get down and dirty about it…so, I did.
Kay Dee: So, tell us more about the questions…
Lacinda: I’d never seen anything like it before…asking about my favorite sexual positions, how many orgasms did I have in one day, even asked about the kinkiest position I enjoyed and why did I like it. Avery helped me describe the outrageous positions. I honestly didn’t have a clue about most of it, but once my imagination got juiced up on wine, I just came up with crazy wild stuff.
Kay Dee: Come on, Lacinda, you had some knowledge about this sort of thing.
Lacinda: No, not really. I led a fairly sheltered life, could only claim one relationship with a college sweetheart and my only experiences with him were missionary style. *smiles* Little did I know about the great big world of sexual gratification. *blushes – only a little*
Kay Dee: Okay, so what did this have to do with you getting on the ship?
Lacinda: Avery is good, I’ll give her that. After we finished off the wine, she pulled out this tiny stringed bikini and asked me to pose like a wanton whore, and she snapped my picture. *grins* Well, after going through all those explicit questions, I didn’t mind acting out a bit. I mean, what could it hurt, just in front of my friend, right? After this she’d quit bugging me about meeting someone.
Kay Dee: Honey, you still haven’t answered my question ~ what did any of this have to do with getting on the singles cruise?
Lacinda: Apparently, the survey was a contest entry and the winners got a three week get away on One Plus One Equals Fun singles cruise liner.
Kay Dee: LOL – Oh that Avery…gotta love her for getting you and Blade together, Lacinda.
Lacinda: I can’t ever, in my wildest dreams, imagine going on this kind of cruise. Talk about no inhibitions! Mazie, the director of the cruise, made sure everyone enjoyed themselves…but, I won’t go into details, you’ll have to read it to find out the rest;)
Kay Dee: Well, that’s a wrap…thank you, Lacinda, for joining me today. Thank you D.C. for letting us hang-out at your lovely place…and to everyone, thank you for stopping in to visit with Lacinda and I
GIVEAWAY CONTEST ~ I’m offering a PDF copy of One Plus One to one lucky commenter who answers this question: What would you name a singles cruise liner? Leave a way that I may contact you – winner will be chosen from a random drawing on Sunday 10/28. GOOD LUCK!

One Plus One Excerpt ~
.
Excellent character interview and excerpt, Kay Dee! So glad you stopped by and please come back any time! Folks don’t forget to enter the contest. I am dying to find out what kind of names you come up with.
Thanks so much for visiting the e-rotica blog, Kay Dee! I know I can’t officially enter but I’ll get the ball rolling… If I could name a cruise ship, I would probably name it something goofy like Penelope or Tom.
Hello D.C….fun! Penelope…hmmm – I’m showing up very late, the post looks brilliant, thank you so much for having Lacinda and I today…Now to spread the word;)
Sweet interview and excerpt. The book looks like fun!
Hi Julia – thanks for stopping by! Lacinda and Blade’s story was fun to write also;)
I love character interviews…they really give us an idea of what we’ve got to look forward to in the book. Lucinda sounds a lot like I probably would in her–erm–position.
Hello Raine – ya, Lacinda has a few of my traits as well…but, I’m not sure I ever would have stepped foot on that cruise *grins* Thanks so much for stopping by;)
Totally fun way to showcase the book, and so effective I had to get me some of that!
Aloha
Toby Neal (author of the Lei Crime Series)
Aloha, Toby:) Thanks so much for stopping in and for the kind compliment…glad you liked the intro (sort of).
Boy. Hard to know what the best name would be. G spot?
Book looks good, Kay Dee.

The New York Design Center was the place to be last night! The What’s New, What’s Next event was a success! I was enchanted in the lovely lap of Laserow, where I met fellow bloggers and got a crash course in Swedish antiques. Founder, Karin Laserow showed me around the showroom pointing out each piece and what period it was from (they focus on Rococo, Gustavian, Empire and Baroque periods), and they quizzed me at the end! Karin has been in the business for 32 years, and her daughter Liza runs the New York Showroom at the NYDC. After sitting with them for only a few minutes, it was evident that they are passionate about this business. I was fascinated by their down to earth perspective on antiques, the chairs must be comfortable and you must be able to live your daily life with these pieces. The way they mix the antique furniture with modern upholstery was refreshing.
I look forward to seeing the outcome of some of Liza’s Interior Design projects she is working on now!
I was amazed by all of the beautiful/industrial lighting options!

Your morning roundup for May 1, the day after Seth Meyers said Weekend Update stuff to people's faces.
• Thirty-two NFL franchises passed on multiple opportunities to draft Boston College's Mark Herzlich, a linebacker who was projected as a first-round pick before he had to take a season off to battle Ewing's sarcoma.
"I guess people are saying I can't play football anymore,'' said Herzlich, already preparing himself for his next battle. "Well I have heard that before and look what happened.'" [Boston Globe] (Photo H/T Scott Lewis Photography)
• Vancouver Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo gave up his first goal of the Nashville Predators series with 1:07 left in the third. Game went to overtime. Then, double overtime. But not triple overtime, because Matt Halischuk of the Predators scored 14:51 into the second extra frame primarily because Nashville goalkeeper Pekka Rinne played the role of every ice-skate-wearing superhero in history. [Tennessean]
• The Philadelphia Flyers got the piss kicked out of them by a team with a track record of ceding three-game series leads. [Boston Bruins]
• On the flip side, the first 18 pitches that Roy Halladay threw against the Mets yesterday were strikes. The 2-1 win made it the first April in which the Phillies won 18 games. [NorthJersey.com]
• They say some, if not many, of the 20,245 who attended yesterday's Rays/Angels game in Tampa Bay were there just to see REO Speedwagon. Well, the opening act was a 10th inning win on a Fernando Rodney bounced-sinker wild pitch, the first such victory in franchise history [Tampa Tribune].
• Emilio "Millito" Navarro, the 105-year-old who was believed to be the oldest living professional baseball player, died Saturday in Puerto Rico. The first Puerto Rican to play in the Negro Leagues, he was the leadoff-hitting shortstop for the New York-based Cuban Stars of the Eastern Colored League in 1928. Navarro said he made $25 a week and enjoyed dancing and the occasional glass of whiskey. With Navarro's passing, Jamie Moyer assumes the oldest living professional baseball player mantle. [AP]
• Former Braves pitcher John Smoltz barely missed being within 26 strokes of the cut at his debut Nationwide Tour event. He was 27-over at the South Georgia Classic. [New York Times]
• That Auburn University is helping the University of Alabama grapple with a tornado-ravaged Tuscaloosa shouldn't be news, as sporting rivalries should in no way dictate someone's common decency when someone else is in pain. In an unrelated story, the fact that Auburn University is helping the University of Alabama grapple with a tornado-ravaged Tuscaloosa is news. [Huntsville Times] [Orlando Sentinel] [AP] [Etc.]
• Brian Dawkins, a 37-year-old safety for the Denver Broncos, thinks drafting quality safeties makes the Broncos stronger on defense and special teams [Denver Post]. Hearing that Hall-of-Fame Broncos QB/Executive VP of Football Operations John Elway say that he's his "biggest fan" made current Broncos QB Tim Tebow feel all warm inside [ESPN].
• With the 34th pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, the Buffalo Bills selected Aaron Williams, cornerback from the University of Texas, guy who posted a picture of himself holding a dead rabbit online. [BuzzFeed]
• Kurt Warner on the Patriots drafting QB Ryan Mallett: "I did text Tom Brady after this pick and he wanted me to know for sure that he was planning on playing 10 more years." [NFL]
• Oh, the lockout's back on so everybody from Cam Newton to Cheta Ozougwu can all just go ahead and workout on their own. [USA Today]
• In football-actually-being-played news, the owner of the Orlando Predators ponied up for a billboard in advance with their Saturday night showdown with the Jacksonville Sharks. He apparently has some sort of beef with the opposing team's hometown so he went with the understated, "Jacksonville Sucks. See you rednecks April 30." Final April 30th score: Rednecks 76, Comic Sans Lite 55. [Orlando Sentinel]
• Kyle Busch won last night's Crown Royal 400 in Richmond, Va. He apparently does this often. [NASCAR]
• After getting some lucky breaks/calls, Chelsea pulled to within three points of EPL leaders Manchester United with a 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur yesterday. Next weekend, the Blues visit Shrek et al. [BBC Sport]
• On the couple-of-days eve of El Clasico V, both Barcelona and Real Madrid lost on the same weekend for the first time since the 2008-09 season. Nothing gold shall stay. [Goal]
• Today's soccer-viewing recommendations: Since Liverpool/Newcastle United is already over, you might want to check out the second half of Arsenal vs. Manchester United, like, now. Other options: Almeria vs. Sevilla at 10:55 a.m., Manchester City vs. West Ham at 11 a.m., Bari vs. Roma at 2:30 p.m. or Palmeiras vs. Corinthians at 2:55 p.m.
Recently On Deadspin
A few stories you might've missed.
"That's Corny": LeBron James said he didn't quit on his Cavs then-teammates in last year's playoff series against Boston.
Athletic Prowess: A Swede takes ping-pong artistry to briefly noticeable levels.
Dick Moves: The governor of Ohio heckled Browns fans during a recent speech. The Browns play in Cleveland, which is in Ohio, where the governor governs.
Bat Manipulation: Roger McDowell's "conversation" with some homo fans, as a talking toon.

."
Smith won't say it, but the Internet will, and it's a very unlikely name being tossed around this time. (And mom isn't involved.)
So now we have a starting point for the 2011 edition of this column, if it comes to that. It shouldn't, but it probably will, and only because the Heat are two games from elimination. We knew coming into this five-year experiment that it would take just big loss to start the LeBron James doubt machine up again. It didn't matter how much was his fault — any loss automatically becomes about him. And, of course, nebulous off-court business.
Listen to Smith's comments again. There's no "there" there. There's nothing. There's something he saw online, and grapevines and weasel words and equivocation and rumors of rumors and zero news, which is what Stephen A. Smith does when he's allowed to talk instead of write. This isn't passing along a rumor: it's starting one, and it's a low blow to bring it up at all to a world hungry for just this kind of bullshit about LeBron James.
We can't put the genie back by ignoring this: it's too late for that. A loud man, on a hugely popular radio show, talking about the most famous man in sports? It's out there, and "legitimate." LeBron's personal life belongs to the world now. Go nuts.

39" LED LCD HDTV, 1080p for $299.99 + free shipping
Use coupon code KHE61894 at checkout.
Anybody have any reviews on this TV?
How is it both LED and LCD? It's an LED TV which is good - but who is TCL?
LED is the backlighting technology... it still uses an LCD to control the image, color and contrast...
I was concerned with TCL as a brand as well but recently bought a 32 inch (new) tv for the bedroom. So far everything has gone smoothly.
I have the 40'' version of this TV that I got from Amazon two Black Fridays ago. The speakers are mediocre but everything else works great. I would definitely buy another.
@bsalamon: could not find reviews for this model anywhere online! :/ It's backed by a 2-year manufacturer's warranty, by the way. "Limited warranty, 24 months for parts and 24 months for labor."
I just had to laugh because who makes a 39 inch TV? :-) Somebody forgot to measure twice and cut once.
Have the 40" LCD I purchased after Christmas .. No problems with this item - I prefer the sound from my receiver, but roomie is satisfied with the audio on the unit..
I just went through to purchase this and found two hidden items. First they charge sales tax on this which comes up to about $25 on a TV. The free shipping requires that you buy a $50 membership with tigerdirect. Otherwise to Georgia it was going to be about a $25 shipping fee for ground. Final price for a no-name tv was going to be about $350. Worst Buy has a 39" brand you have heard of, RCA, for about $325 that with tax would come up to the same price and you can get it the same day and have a place to take it back if you have a problem. Just my 2cents! I was in for two of these at that price till they threw the two curveballs. :)
@tankstew: Shipping should be free. Make sure you select Econo shipping (4-9 days, residential only). The membership you're talking about (called Inner Circle) gives free shipping on all orders made at TigerDirect, but you don't need it because this item already qualifies for free shipping. After entering in your shipping information in step 2, check step 3 (the first option should be selected).
@tankstew: Also, the RCA TV you mentioned () is a regular LCD TV (lit by a fluorescent lamp as opposed to LED's).
Seems like a great price for a 39" LED not sure if its too good a price though.... hmmm it is definitely tempting.
Just picked one up. I remember reading that TCL actually used a Samsung LCD in their 40" TV (you could clearly see the Samsung logo through the back vents) Hoping this is the same thing. If not, it's still a really good deal since this company also sells under the RCA name
Just snaked one of these bad boys real quick! I was tempted on the last similar Newegg deal that came out, but Newegg charges CA sales tax, so no go...but Tigerdirect is $299 to the front door of any CA home. Helllz ya.
The price is up to 349.99 now.
@reeds101: I remember seeing the same thing on Amazon. If Samsung likes them enough to outsource to them, I'd say that's good enough for me. TCL seems like a good brand, and a great way to get a bargain on an HDTV.
@avenger885: I have a 39" TV. They are pretty common :)
Not sure whether to +1 @murixbob for telling us the price was raised, or -1 because I dislike that fact.
+1 to you, good sir. Thanks.
Perhaps we could let the OP @cornellbigred and/or @shawnmiller know and the price can be updated to $349.99?

The survival kit comes complete with a camouflage sheath with belt clip, to keep your protection close to you when on the run.

Where was it manufactured, anybody know? I only buy USA-made products whenever possible, especially tools.
Omaha tools has a history of being very Pro-Zombie! They have donated to the Zombie Federal political parties and have spearheaded major legistlation aimed at the proper handling and processing of human brains for consumption.
Please if you purchase this item check for any flaws that could cause it to fail in the event of a zombie attack

Hooray, an outfit post! My computer is mostly better, although after I got it back from its recall the boys who fixed it told me they found malware on it. I think I have pretty insane virus protection so I'm not really sure how that happened, but I don't want to spend what they charge ($200) on getting it removed! Is anyone a computer smarty pants with good ideas on how to fix that?
These photos are from a trip to Prospect Park. I have been exploring Brooklyn which has been really exciting for me; I love visiting new neighborhoods and finding coffee shops or restaurants to return to. Seeing how different the people are in every neighborhood is fun too, it's like going into another little country when you get a few blocks into every new section. Prospect Park was lovely on this day because everyone was out having picnics and birthday parties and riding their bikes. My lovely lovely friend Ginger (whose bed I am staying in before I move into my new apartment) took these photos and I think they turned out so well. It was the perfect time in the afternoon to take them, and it is so nice to have a person behind my camera, rather than a tripod! I know I've said this before but I am so jealous of bloggers who have real people to take their pictures!
This is Ginger...she's so stylish!
I have so much time on my hands, what with not having a real job and all that jazz. I have been writing a bit for Baeblemusic, but other than that no exciting job offers (or even boring job offers...I would settle for that at this point!) have come along. If any of you are music lovers you can check out my first review here. I think I'm going to be exploring a lot more until a job pops up!
