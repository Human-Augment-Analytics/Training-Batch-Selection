MISSION — The Mission City Council approved a measure for a road expansion project on the city’s west side into Palmview.
On Monday, leaders approved the cost of engineering services for the Mile 2 West project to create a four-lane road, with a fifth lane at intersections, between Conway Avenue in Mission and La Homa Road in Palmview in the amount of $1,257,229. L&G Engineering will do the work.
Engineer Jacinto Garza said the total cost of the project is $4,032,000, which will come from federal and state funds. The money for the project will be administered through the Metropolitan Planning Organization, as the project involves more than one city. The project will be funded in the 2012 fiscal year’s budget, which means work will start the latter part of 2012.
Garza said the road would be similar to the expansion of Mile 2 East, which is due for completion in a couple of months.
In other action, the council held a public hearing on use of the Community Block Development grant funds. The city is being funded $765,469, which is $148,748 less than the city received last year.
The Citizen’s Advisory Committee recommended $50,000 for housing rehabilitation assistance, $500,000 for housing reconstruction assistance, $90,000 for housing administration, and $115,000 for CD Housing Program Administration. The only public services they wanted to fund were Amigos Del Valle at $5,000 and Children’s Advocacy at $3,500.
Mayor Norberto “Beto” Salinas recommended funding Dentists Who Care at $10,000, the Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council-Area Agency on Aging at $10,000, Amigos Del Valle at $10,000, and Children’s Advocacy at $10,000.
Tony Cadena, director of the Meals on Wheels Program, run by Amigos Del Valle, asked the council to reconsider the cut in funding set by the CAC at $5,000. The department serves one meal a day to 900 elderly residents and had a waiting list of 142 people. Cadena asked for the full $15,000.
After hearing the request, Salinas said it should be funded for $15,000.
Belinda Garcia and Dr. Noe Cardenas of Dentists Who Care asked for $10,000 in funding for their project that serves low-income children in Mission who have dental problems needing immediate dental treatment.
Salinas also recommended funding Dentists Who Care at $10,000 instead of the requested $20,000.
To cover these additional costs, Salinas recommended having the city supplement the housing administrative costs to allow the additional funding for the public service agencies.
The items will be approved at the next meeting.
The council also approved two memorandums of understanding with the Mission and Sharyland school districts allowing use of the Shary Municipal Golf Course for students for the coming school year.
The Mission Police Department was given authorization to apply for the 2012 Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws black Grant to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. The grant, if received, is $15,000.
The police department will also submit a grant application for the 2012 Tobacco Compliance Grant Application to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.
Authorization to solicit bids for four new police cars and the special equipment needed to outfit them via the state approved contracts was approved.
Authorization to request for qualifications for the enhancement of the Mesh Network Hardware to add five additional cameras to the system was approved. Police Chief Leo Longoria, Jr. said long-range plans are to add a total of 15 additional cameras for safety in the city.
The police department was also authorized to solicit bids via the state buy board for two police dogs to replace to older dogs in the canine force.
The council approved the recommendation of S.S.P. Design, LLC to do the schematic and irrigation designs for the irrigation system at Jaycee and Birdwell Parks.
The firm was also selected to do landscape and irrigation designs for the irrigation system at the Northwest (Hollis Rutledge, Sr.) Park at a cost of $2,850.
The Monday, May 23, council meeting has been changed to Wednesday, May 25, due to a conflict of the mayor and city.

Bissonnette says he’d take a salary rollback

For.
- jimw81 - Nov 21, 2012 at 11:49 PM
Bissonnette nailed it. there will be no real progress unless a owner like jacobs is involved on the other side. You don’t see an reasonable person like shananhan or a yzerman in the room on the owners side and there is reason for it. Look at the last lockout, lou lamoriello was the voice of reason for both sides and they were able to get it resolved.

For all those of you out there that feel the owners that signed players to big contracts knowing that they would roll them back, therefore cheating the players out of money. I ask this then, how would the players feel if the owners signed them to their regular sized overpaid contracts then went for a roll back? Now that would be more like cheating them out of money wouldn’t it?
-
- stakex - Nov 22, 2012 at 2:16 AM
The thing is, people who attack the owners for giving out big contracts right before fighting to roll back said cotnracts have a narrow minded view of the situation.
First of all, it wasn’t just the owners giving out these deals like candy during the summer… it was also players demanding these deals. Why? Becuase the players knew damn well that a salary rollback was a very real possibility going into the CBA talks, and that other changes might be made to contracts (like length limits). So yeah, you can say its hypocritical for owners to give out these deals and then demand a rollabck. However in a lot of cases the owners were pretty much forced to give out such deals or risk losing valuable players.
Theres really no one to blame in all that and no fingers should be pointed. Its business. The players wanted to get the best deal possible, and the owners didn’t want to miss out on or lose good players due to CBA uncertainty… and both sides were well aware of the pending CBA talks.

These are probably the most all around level-headed comments I’ve seen from either side in a long time. He not only accepts that this is just business…. but also accepts the reality of the situation.

- id4joey - Nov 22, 2012 at 4:45 AM
At this point one has to wonder if the players will take a page out of the NBA labor negotiations from last year. Will the players make a move to decertify the PA to force the hand of the owners, or will they push for a mediator. Certainly viable options as dissention will continue to increase within the membership.
-
- pastabelly - Nov 22, 2012 at 9:04 AM
He’s right about Jacobs. He is a selfish POS. The Bruins are very profitable and now spend to the cap. He’d love to spend much less and make obscene profits. Thanks for doubling ticket prices over three tears, you selfish prick. He is why I side with the players.

- gallyhatch - Nov 22, 2012 at 9:29 AM
Glad to know I’m not the only person who subscribes to the completely insane idea that Bettman is an extension/ employee of the owners and not the other way around. Do people really think he would still have a job if the owners didn’t like what he was doing? It’s their league, not his.
Thumbs down all you want, but this lockout is between the players & owners, not Fehr & Bettman; blaming the representatives of the two parties is ridiculous.
-
- shotzongoal - Nov 22, 2012 at 11:57 AM
The player’s salaries are based on the CBA percentages of gross revenues or total sales. The owners know this, the players know this, the player’s agents know this and the union knows this. Before the old CBA expired, when all the multi-million dollar, multi-year contracts were, sought out by the agents, offered by the owners and gleefully accepted by the players, everyone involved knew these would be contingent on the new CBA. There should be no surprises. The owners may have to cram a 57% salary into a 50% limit. Again everyone, player, agents, union officials and owners knew this could be a possibility. Both the players and owners are at fault for this mess but in reality it think everyone involved went into this with eyes wide open.
-
- id4joey - Nov 22, 2012 at 12:28 PM
shotzongoal, It was reported that the NHL would like the next CBA to be retroactive. That is, all previously awarded front loaded contracts would be subject to the new CBA terms. We’re not talking about only contracts signed over the summer of 2012, not that it matters because one would think that anything signed before the expiration of the last CBA would not be affected by the next CBA, of course exception is made for the players share of HRR which should be a percentage anyways. In other words, the structure of a contract should be honored based on the CBA in existence when the contract was signed. Again, the PA would like front loaded contracts like Luongo’s and Hossa’s to be honored. However, the owners don’t want to honor them. So, this could lead to the players making a request to decertify the union, which will give them other legal avenues to pursue the owners to have current contract structures)

“You’re living in the best possible time to create. In your hand, you hold devices that far exceed the technology that countries depended on thirty years ago for their intel. Think about that”
~ D.Request
The other day I was colouring with my youngest niece, I used all the tools I had learned to display a beautiful portrait. Outlining. Colouring within the lines. Use of many different colours. I really let my creative juices run amuck. Pink dirt. Golden windows. I was the creator and this was my canvas. Beside me, my niece went out of the lines and used almost every colour imaginable and to me, this was the most beautiful piece of art. I sat and pondered what her four year old brain was seeing. Not yet jaded by the restrictions set by others.
“That guy can’t have Orange skin”
“Lights don’t come in rainbows”
“You’re going outside of the lines”
“There’s no such thing”
Her mind was able to decipher beautiful in a much more unburdened way. It actually makes me sad to know that at some point she’ll assimilate and have to rediscover herself, like I did.
I am a self aware social media entusiast. I live and die by the tools that promote me, as a brand and as a global citizen. My creativity stems from the fact I see things plainly and decipher it with total disregard of outsider opinions. Today marks a great time in history. When I was young, I communicated by telephone, then icq, then text, then bbm and now through twitter. Things have changed in my short three decades breathing all this oxygen. I look around and see the ingenuity of my friends, becoming self employed and working out the kinks of a flawed system. Some of my favourite youtube acts have broken the mould and become stars just based on their promotion of themselves. You can lump Jenna Marbles, D.Request, Karmin, Ill Doctrine and Connor Maynard into that group. They have all attained some small fraction of success by cultivating the niche that made them marketable.
While my goal is not riches or fame, but more happiness and self-improvement, I think it still prudent to discuss how anything is now possible. I ready myself for another adventure at the latter part of this year (barring the Mayan’s prediction) and constantly reassess my situation, not unlike a certain woman once told me I would. Things are always in flux and that’s how I like it, at least for right now. The point here is “impossible is nothing”, for real, this is the opportunity of your lives. You have been given the golden keys to Wonka’s factory, yes, I know it was a ticket – you get the picture.
At your fingertips, you hold unparalleled information. This age has given us the opportunity to pursue our dreams like no other period in history. Where just a generation ago, it was almost unfathomable to jetset around the world and live the nomadic life. Now, it’s pretty commonplace, I’ve met tons of people over the blogisphere who have took the information within their hands and harnessed it to the best of their ability. My message today is to use your means, if you dislike something – change it. There’s no excuses anymore, there never was an excuse for that matter. You hold the keys here, nobody else.
“The universe is wider than our views of it” (Thoreau))

Pat McCrory took another swipe at Beverly Perdue over offshore oil drilling.
The Republican gubernatorial nominee used a lunch speech before a commercial real estate and construction group in Cary to drum his message that Perdue, the Democratic nominee, has flip-flopped on offshore drilling, Mark Johnson reports.
Perdue in June said she was "100 percent opposed" to drilling off North Carolina's coast but last week said she would appoint an independent panel of scientists and engineers to help decide.
McCrory quipped that he doesn’t know where she stands.
"I guess I’ll find out tonight," he said referring to a planned debate to be broadcast at 8 p.m. on WTVD-TV in the Raleigh-Durham market.
McCrory addressed the Raleigh area chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties and the Triangle Community Coalition.

New JKR-ku app by the Ministry of Development
Thursday, 24 January 2013 09:11
WITH the development of Internet usage in Brunei Darussalam covering more than three quarters of the total population, the Ministry of Development (MoD), through the Public Works Department (PWD), has stepped forward and come up with an application known as JKR-ku.
JKR-ku is an application that was created to upgrade the management of complaints and report on the problems experienced by the general public, while PWD is known as a government organisation that offers maintenance and repair services for its users.
During the launching ceremony of PWD’s latest application, JKR-ku, Pehin Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan Dato Seri Setia Awg Haji Suyoi bin Haji Osman, the Minister of Development and guest of honour, said in his speech that it is hoped the application will be able to improve the services of the PWD, enhancing their management quality in handling reports and complaints from the general public.
Through this application, the guest of honour urged the PWD to provide a fast and more efficient response to the complainants via e-mail or telephone and also to better record all complaints and responses for future references.

Furthermore, the minister also stated that the name of the application, JKR-ku, is to showcase PWD as an organisation that invites all citizens in the department to be responsible in supporting the mission and vision of PWD and the MoD.
Through this application, said the guest of honour, PWD hopes that it will illustrate their concern and care towards members of the public by their continuous efforts and will give assurance to the consumers to use the application and provide information about any complaints and problems that could be acted upon quickly.
The minister also hoped that MoD and PWD will be well received by members of the public and the consumers will be proactive in assisting and helping PWD to deal with any damages or problems before it becomes a bigger problem or is neglected.
“As a government department that is heavily involved with the public, such initiatives are most welcome because the service we provide is not in the form of ‘one-go’ but is continuous,” he continued.
Through this initiative, the minister said that the application can also help the people to monitor the work of the ministry and enable the ministry to maintain their service quality.
Members of the public can now simply file their complaints through their smartphones by sending the information to the latest application, known as JKR-ku, designed and developed by the Public Works Department (PWD) through Webpixel Technoloogy.
Members of the public can send information through the application and at the same time, senders can also attach photos of the complaint and problem. Once they send their complaints, they will receive their reference number through an automated notification from the system.
All of the complaints received will then be forwarded to the Ministry of Development’s Customer Care Hotline Centre at 140. The complainant can contact the hotline 140 for the update status of their complaint.
During the launching, the department also presented its newly revamped official website () that offers mainly the information of the services that the department is offering.
PWD’s new website aims to be more user-friendly so that the public can obtain information that is required and simultaneously promote the information about PWD.
The main objective of developing JKR-ku is to offer an alternative for members of the public to send in their complaints, not only through hotline but also through PWD’s website and the JKR-ku application.

Brief Description
Active Minds is a student-run program that addresses the stigma surrounding mental illness among college students. Started in 2001 at the University of Pennsylvania, Active Minds has worked to expose and reduce stigma associated with mental illness within increasingly judgmental college environments. Active Minds, Inc., located in Washington, DC, is the national headquarters for all Active Minds on Campus chapters.
SituationWithin the last few years the atmospheres of colleges and universities has changed. This change is due in part to an increasingly competitive job market and a subsequent increase in pressure placed on a students academic performance. Mental illnesses abound on campuses across the country, and yet students seek help infrequently, primarily due to the heavy social stigma and pressures applied by their peers. Alison Malmon, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, saw the need to address the stigmas of mental illness at colleges and universities after her older brother, Brian, committed suicide.
SolutionSince 2001, Active Minds has grown from a single chapter at its home university into 132 chapters based at colleges and universities,two high schools, and internationally. These chapters support mental health awareness, education, and advocacy designed for students in higher education. Active Minds also serves as a liaison between college students and the mental health community.
ResultsActive Minds focuses on increasing students awareness of mental health issues, providing information and resources regarding mental health and mental illness, and encouraging students to seek help as soon as it is needed. So far, the campaign has been successful, receiving great recognition, exposure, and support from within the mental health community.
ContactTo obtain further information about Active Minds, you may contact the national headquarters by calling 202-332-9595 or by visiting the Active Minds Web site.

UK family got on property ladder by buying Garage
The UK is witness of a unique new property investment, made by the Borman family from St Neots, Cambridgeshire. They found an extraordinary way of getting on the property ladder. Instead of buying a bigger home, they invested in a garage which they turned into a new living room.
The Borman family has been living in the St Neots, Cambridgeshire whole their lives. The 44 year old Martin, his wife Lindy and daughter Amber were having a hard time living in a house that is just too small for them. They had thought about investing in another property over and over again but due to their current financial situation they were not able to buy themselves a new home. Even though they could afford to buy a new home, they knew something had to change. Therefore they used the money they had saved up to buy themselves a £6,500 lock-up garage and turned it into an extra room. Read more of this post

As PRS currently is changing their distribution in Europe, PRS parts like string nuts are not available in Germany at the moment and no dealer can tell me how long this situation will last.
Concentrating on one distributor for the whole of Europe may seem as a clever move from your side of the Atlantic, but to be honest this never worked out in the past.
So as original PRS string nuts will be not available in my country for an unspecified space of time, what would be the next best thing as a replacement? Black Tusq XL?

I'd really like to get from the five way blade:
1) Just the bridge pickup humbucker
2) Just the bridge pickup split single coil
3) both - singles or humbuckers - whatever will work
4) Just the neck split single coil
5) Just the neck humbucker
It hit home the other day trying to play "Mary Jane's last dance" that I wanted my single coil sounds back. I also heard David himself during a DGT demo get that bridge Tele pickup sound out of a DGT - I want that tone back. So go buy a DGT? Right? Yes - if it had a PIEZO. ;-)
So I wonder with the electronics for the PIEZO - is it possible to rewire it to get these combinations?

For over ten years now, the Hot Shots Golf series has been providing PlayStation fans with lighthearted links action that is simple enough for casual players to enjoy yet deep enough for experienced players to get into as well. Recently, the first PS3 entry in the series mixed things up by introducing a new swing meter. This new PSP version, however, retains the traditional method of hitting the ball, which should please Hot Shots purists and those used to playing the original Open Tee.
This game's predecessor was one of the finest titles available during the early days of the PSP, and for the most part, very little has changed in this sequel. You still take control of an adorable, large-headed golfer and play through your choice of modes: Training, Stroke Play (the standard golf game), or Challenge (where you compete to unlock new characters, items, and courses). On the surface, the game may be a bit too similar to the original for some people. Dig deeper, however, and you'll find all sorts of new features that add to the overall experience.
The bulk of the additions are found in Challenge mode, where you'll probably spend most of your single-player time. There are six new courses to play on in addition to six "classic" courses. There are two characters to choose from at first, but you'll eventually unlock twenty. As before, you're rewarded by continuing to use the same character through a loyalty meter that fills whenever you play a round. The more loyal a character becomes to you, the more advanced techniques you're able to use.
Upon completing challenges, you win cards that give you new items that alter your character's appearance in three different categories: head (usually a new hairstyle or hat), body (new clothing), and accessory (all sorts of things from glasses to a miniature car to ride in). In addition to appearance, equipping different items will alter your character's stats, giving the game a light RPG touch. As you earn more cards, your overall level increases as well, and eventually you'll gain enough cards to challenge (and potentially unlock) a new character.
Cinderella Story. Outta Nowhere.
The added bonuses don't stop there. You're now encouraged to more thoroughly explore the various holes when given a prompt by your caddy. Once you hear the clue, start moving the camera around and search for a sparkling light. If it's found, you'll earn a new item. These can be new wearable items or different clubs or golf balls that grant new abilities. Sometimes you'll even find a hidden character who will offer to join you if certain conditions are met. These range from having a particular item equipped to performing a specific shot. This sort of mild exploration isn't something that you usually see in a golf game, and it's a fun method to add a little more depth to the single-player.
Of course, you won't be spending all of your time playing alone. Unfortunately, there's no option to play a multiplayer game on one system by passing the PSP to different players in between turns. The game does, however, support up to eight players via ad hoc networking. More importantly, Open Tee 2 includes a major feature that was absent on its predecessor, online play. Up to 16 people can compete with each other over Wi-Fi. The pre-game lobby is a bit barebones, but it gets the job done. At least you can "chat" with other players through a series of bizarrely humorous (and occasionally grammatically incorrect) prompts like, "Did you date my sister," "I won't eat chili again," "You ain't the judging of me," and the ever-popular "Sorry. I farted." Luckily, all the players take their shots simultaneously, so you're not forced to watch everyone play. The minute-long breaks between rounds can be a bit tiresome, but chatting during the downtime does give you a chance to compliment the other players (or yourself).
Hot Shots' main draw has always been its accessibility. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a divot-diggin' noob, it's always been an easy game to pick up and enjoy. Open Tee 2 is no different. The more you play, the more techniques become available to help deal with the more challenging courses. The wide variety of unlockables is also a great incentive to keep playing. If you've invested a lot of time in the original you may get a feeling of deja vu, but Open Tee 2 is still a blast.

OK.... i'm VERY much enjoying the FBA Next Emu, with a pretty full 7GB romset......... its lovely.
I have heard fans of this mention MAME roms when they could not find a full set of FBANEXT roms..., so
i am going to aquire a set of MAME ROMS later this morning.....
My question is.....
1 Are these MAME ROMS pretty much ok to run on FBA Next?
2 How do u go past the "Press ok to continue", with a PS3 Joypad..?
3 Is there a dedicated MAME Emu for PS3, or one in the works, that anyone knows of? (Every machine has a MAME... so maybe..?)
Thanks for looking at my questions..... a bit noob & dope maybe, but hey!
& THANKS!

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.-.
Ng's work area in a corner of the Hatsopoulos Microfluids Laboratory contains a variety of dough-manipulating devices. To measure torque, or turning properties, the mixograph twists the dough around metal pins the way saltwater taffy is spun in a candy shop; the filament stretcher pulls the dough until it snaps.
To conduct experiments, Ng works with small samples of flour ground from grains newly developed by farmers and food engineers. He painstakingly records how the resulting dough is treated and how it reacts to manipulation, because different blends of flour, water and additives can result in drastically different dough. Atmospheric conditions and time of day also can affect the product's elasticity and rise.
Getting the dough to stay put can be a chore. "It sticks to pretty much everything other than the things you want it to stick to," Ng said.
Ng wasn't always cut out for dough. He completed a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from Cambridge University in England and arrived at the Gas Turbine Laboratory at MIT with the goal of designing airplane engines. Airplane engines are designed with air flow in mind, and Ng made the switch to "fluid mechanics of a different sort," he said, when he heard McKinley needed a dough man. Working with dough, he said, sounded like something "different and fun."
The research also has a serious side. For millennia, bakers have developed a feel for dough as they kneaded it. But this homespun approach isn't good enough for large commercial operations, which need "numbers" representing a material's properties during the manufacturing process, Ng said.
Ng helps define those properties while seeking a deeper understanding of the micro-structure of dough.
Gluten gives dough its distinctive elastic behavior. To engineers, gluten is a nanoscale bio-macromolecule, one of the largest protein compounds on earth. These proteins form an entangled matrix whose quality, shape and distribution within the dough are intrinsically linked to its bread-making qualities.
"The texture of bread--the chewiness and mouth feel--is dependent on the dough you start with," Ng said. "The airiness of the bread, or, from a commercial point of view, the amount of air they sell you, is directly related to the ability of the dough to resist rupture during the deformation process as it rises. When bread is in the oven, air bubbles within the dough expand. At some point they break, and the bread stops expanding."
Wonder Bread, Ng said, is "a very airy product."
Ng doesn't usually eat his experiments because the laboratory dough is covered with silicone oil to keep it from drying out. But since starting this line of research in 2003, Ng has become a home baker. When he bakes bread, he brings a bit of the dough in for testing. White bread, he said, is his favorite.
Ng's work is funded by Kraft Foods.

In clinical practice, it is common to encounter
parents with either medical or psychiatric illness or both. Working
with parents with such illnesses provides an important opportunity
to help both parents and their children. In this chapter, we address
two areas. First, we discuss parental mental illness that places
families at higher risk for the development of disorder in children and
at the same time provides an important opportunity for preventive
intervention. Using children of parents with depression as a model,
we specifically discuss risk factors, protective factors, and resilience
and review prevention programs. We outline prevention programs that
have been developed for families with anxiety disorders and substance
abuse disorders. Second, we address directly what clinicians can
do when they encounter parents with mental illness in their practice, based
on both clinical experience and the research on preventive intervention.
We have not focused on medical illness, although we believe many
of the same principles apply, given many studies include parents
who have both mental and physical illness..).

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in people with bipolar disorder may be a distinct familial entity and perhaps even a distinct disorder.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) plus bipolar disorder is a distinct familial entity and perhaps even a distinct disorder, a study reported in the January Journal of Psychiatric Research suggests.
The study was headed by Joseph Biederman, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
Biederman and his colleagues studied 401 children with bipolar disorder, ADHD, or both, as well as nearly 1,200 of their relatives. They found that when children had bipolar disorder alone, their relatives were also more likely to have bipolar disorder alone; when children had ADHD alone, their relatives were also more likely to have ADHD alone, and when children had bipolar disorder in addition to ADHD, their relatives were also more likely to have both disorders.
“The co-segregation findings suggest that ADHD plus bipolar disorder is a distinct familial entity and, perhaps, a distinct disorder,” Biederman and his team said. “[And] the idea that ADHD comorbid with bipolar disorder is a distinct disorder is further supported by emerging neurobiological findings.” For example, the gene that codes for the dopamine transporter has been linked with both ADHD and bipolar disorder.
Further studies addressing genetic association and neuroimaging of subjects with both bipolar disorder and ADHD “may yield important information regarding course, treatment, and the neurobiology of bipolar disorder plus ADHD to determine if this combined condition should be considered a distinct disorder,” Biederman and his colleagues also noted.
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Fund, the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric Psychopharmacology Council, and the Susan G. Berk Endowed Fund for Juvenile Bipolar Disorder. ■

Davey Mato Butorac Will Be Tried in 2013
Langley serial killer Davey Mato Butorac will go to trial for the 2006 slaying of Aldergrove’s Margaret Redford sometime in the late fall or early spring of 2013.
Margaret Redford
Jury selection for his trial is slated for Jan. 29 to Feb. 4, 2013 in B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster. He was last in court on this matter on March 29.
Butorac is already serving a life sentence for killing two sex trade workers in the spring and summer of 2007. DNA found on his shoe and in his car linked him to those murders, which took place in Langley City and Abbotsford.
The names of the 2 women that he has been found guilty of killing are Gwendolyn Lawton and Sheryl Koroll. I think it is distateful that this article does not use their names only their occupation. These woman were so much more than ‘sex trade workers’.
Gwen Lawton and Sheryl Lynn Koroll.
There is an excellent article about the evidence that led to his arrest here.
On July 7, 2007, IFIS was called to Langley where the body of a woman had been found in an industrial area. Cpl. Krumbhols was part of the team that responded. He and his partner collected evidence including footprints, tire tracks, DNA swabs and cigarette butts. Much of what was collected was ruled out as belonging to employees but there was one set of footprints and one set of tire tracks that could not be accounted for. There was also a tire track on Koroll’s right wrist. She was run over by the very car from which she’d been dumped.

Steve Barnes, in reply to
When it happened just that particular variety for miles around would bolt to seed and die.
Aparently they do that
In fact, many bamboos only flower at intervals as long as 65.
I was wondering if the rapid growth may be a precursor to such an event.
I was wondering if the rapid growth may be a precursor to such an event.
It's what I thought of when you mentioned it. I've only seen bamboo flowering twice, once in the late 70s in Wellington, and about 10 years later in the Auckland area. Typical grass flowers, turning to seed heads like rye grass. In both cases it was that common running variety that's a noxious weed in places like Greymouth district (I've seen it overwhelming native bush near Blackball). Something triggers its clock and there's a mass flowering followed by the big die-off. Bad time to be a panda.
I remember a dismal rainy drive through drawn-out Dargaville where there was a lot of bamboo up farmhouse driveways etc. It looked as if the place had been hit with agent orange. Apparently some of the non-running varieties have become so dependent on suckering that they've never been known to flower.
Yep, common running bamboo - and so-called bamboo grass- are noxious weeds* as far south as Haast.
I asked my big nursery cousin for a variety of bamboo** that wouldnt engulf the entire neighbourhood and he gave me a plant, v.thin-stemmed, that - he garenteed- would be green forever and stay put...it has done so, and is still a joy.
*I sometimes think today's noxious weed (furze, wilding pines, bamboo) may be tomorrow's really useful plant. I know this is not a popular view with DoC.
**I plant symbolic things in places that I love: here, it was an apple tree (Cox's Orange), a totara (there were none on the flat at the time of planting) the bamboo, and 3 different types of ti-rakau...they all thrive.
keeping our powder dry...
I wrote an early morning comment - but then my wireless connection faded as the snow flurries thickened - but I was impressed that the Press delivery got through, and less impressed that several large snow-laden branches fell on the car (no real damage luckily the car had a padding of powder snow too) and in the absence of any small quakes to do the job, I had to go out and whack some of the other trees and shrubs which were at breaking point...
...it was pretty neat watching it snow most of the day - then the sun came out for a while and it was all drip, drip, drip - now it's all cold, dark and slushy out there...
Life is ever interesting down here...
PS: loved that "the icing on the quake" line...
and Islander surely your mum's dog would be a Bijon Freeze today?
Yo! Good one! - Bella is a nice little animal, and, like all her kind, she has a thick woolly coat. Unfortunately her pads - and tongue- dont-

Really envy Bob’s igloo, btw.
With the housing shortage in Christchurch we’re planning to rent it out. In fact, your envy has made us raise our original asking price.
SPECIFICATIONS: Suitable for a family of four. Refrigeration included at no extra cost: $450 per week. No vegetarians. Suitable for people who like the colour white.
Refrigeration included at no extra cost: $450 per week. No vegetarians.
Perfect spot to chill out & chew the fat.
As an old Antarctic explorer, may I comment on your "igloo". We were taught how to make both igloo and hedgehog. Yours is technically a hedgehog. What is supposed to happen is the support you piled the snow over gets removed and the inside hole gets 'chiselled' out to fit he who wishes to inhabit the 'obbit hole. We piled snow over our packs. The snow (if it is crispy enough) will stick quite nicely such that you can even stand on it.
How goes your snow??? Is suspect your snow is NZ sea level snow. Wet.
And when the wind stops blowing.....isn't it amazingly quiet??? I remember being in the Windless Bight, south of Ross Island. The quietest place I have ever experienced. Nothing. White, deep snow, miles from anywhere and you could even hear your blood flow. Breathing was too noisy.
White, deep snow, miles from anywhere and you could even hear your blood flow. Breathing was too noisy.
My mother reports that the local hoons - who use her street as part of their circuit- and the truckies - who normally also use her street as part of their detour route-are conspicuously absent. "It's so quiet...."
Snow itself: the sound of silence-
and yes, the snow has been both *coastal* and sealevel through much of the south.
Heh.
So...Hilary...are we off to the knackers now?
Pssst....call me. I'm good with gizmos.
Nice tree hut though...don't you think?
Hilary Stace, in reply to
Lovely tree hut, beautiful ladder. I like engineers (my father had three engineering degrees but wasn't very good at the practical application), and just got that clip from another source and it seemed appropriate, although it was not about snow.
Suitable for people who like the colour white
non-hillside modernist decor
Perhaps it’s because I’m in upstate New York at the moment, remembering the long grey winters here...
How're you liking the unbearable heat we have right now, then, eh? Gaaah. I would happily - happily - donate a good twenty or thirty degrees to the good people of Christchurch.
On the plus side, I can now tell you the closest ice cream purveyor to any point in town, and have finally figured out what the "mist" setting on the hose is for.
Ice Station Zebra crossing
it's a crunchy morning in Chchch
all the snow is now iceblocks or sheets
cars sound like icebreakers outside...
...so watch out under trees & eaves today folks
Gravity is implacable and meltwater
a great lubricant, cycle helmets all round!
Meanwhile, MetService spokesman Bob McDavitt said he heard a report of a snow flake being seen in Lambton Quay. I’m off to build the world’s smallest snowman.
I can confirm that more than one flake of snow was seen in Kelburn - it snowed at my place for oooohhh, 5 minutes at least! Very exciting! Except I was so busy tweeting about it it didn't occur to me to take a photo. Darn it!
Today is a beautiful blue-sky day here in Welli - and it's FREEZING - although I suspect not quite as freezing as the South Island. * sigh * I miss proper snow.
I apologise for the threadjack, but I keep forgetting to post this on a Friday. It's irrelevant, of course (to pretty much everything).
I downloaded that for a friend of the teutonic persuasion a while back, who blurted out "That's beautiful!" at about 5 seconds in, before remembering that they were supposed to laugh at it.
Horns of the di lemma? Horn, horns, horning around.
Lederhausen or as Wiki points out, these are more correctly Liederhosen, song-breeches.

I bet both their names are Stan.
Megan Wegan, in reply to

Snowman is an Island-
er.
Still can't get over that Snow Dalek. That was just awesomeness personified.
Is that Donne gagging out there in the sleet?
Shall I rush out and toll the fire bell?
Nah, it's too bloody cold...
but the puns & wordplay from you jokers are quite warming-
Ironically, David, whilst in Fiji, Kath pxted me with a photo of her 17cm of snow in normally balmy Waimairi Beach. Lovely. And yes, think of how much your house has seen in the last 100 yrs. She is far too lovely to be laid waste to.

If trademe forums had existed (did it?) a few weeks before the 2002 election, you'd probably have found a preponderance of rightwingers moaning on about helengrad and the like.
Dinah Dunavan, in reply to
Any candidate who goes into the last week of a campaign complaining about “media bias” is in a losing position, that line may shore up your core support but looks whiney and dishonest to the undecideds
Unless you happen to be Winston Peters, in which case you look strong and pricipled and the swing voters head towards you in droves.
Not releasing the tapes is playing right into Peter's hands. He is getting way more news time than he might have done otherwise and I haven't heard anyone calling "bull shit" on his pronouncements regarding the content of the tapes. Which makes me think that either he knows the content, or the media is his poodle again.
Richard Aston, in reply to
the media is his poodle again.
Dinah the media have always been his poodle ( with some exceptions) he whistles and they came running up like puppy dogs eager for some action.
If trademe forums had existed (did it?) a few weeks before the 2002 election, you'd probably have found a preponderance of rightwingers moaning on about helengrad and the like.
There was a popular NZ forum I used to hang around on for a period of a few years which happened to coincide with both the 2005 and 2008 elections. I used to play a variation on Godwin: how many posts would it take for an entirely unrelated subject to attact a post decrying PC gone mad and the KKKlarke government in Helengrad.
Someone would start a thread asking how to change their oil filter/worm the cat/tie a fishing lure/fix their flux capacitor/whatever, and it was more or less guaranteed that within half a dozen posts someone would post a rantette about how it was so much more difficult these days because you couldn't import the parts required, they were banned, just because all those children in Oaklahoma went blind, it was all the gubbermint's fault, a free man couldn't breath these days without some interfering lesbian peering over his shoulder, and so on. It got highly tedious very quickly, and I gave that particular forum up a couple of years ago.
But it was usually the same couple of dozen or so users every time (out of probably 500 active/semi-active participants). Filtering their opinion as outliers was relatively straightforward. And, possibly uniquely, I met a reasonable number of the other users in real life. Their opinions sync'd reasonably closely to what they were saying online, and were, I think, a reasonable way of gauging 'the public mood'. So, even allowing (and compensating for) the 'angry right winger' element, something like the TM forums, which are active across a broad scope of NZ society, could be a useful way of sniffing the air. Maybe. Interviewing a browser is perilous at the best of times.
Bart Janssen, in reply to
I'm not going to change anyone else's mind and vice versa
That seems to be the message of this election entirely. For all the sound and fury, for all the photo opportunities, the polls* seem to show that people made up their minds 6 months ago or more.
It doesn't stop us having discussions.
* But the polls may not be correct, sample sizes are small and sampling is not random so that leaves me very curious about the results of the only poll that actually matters.
Richard Aston, in reply to
Me too JLM - I am really worried about the level of unbridled power about to wash over us like a tsunami .
Tim Watkins blog on this has not had much pick up yet. He's looking out over the teapots to a very scary future.
Euan Mason, in reply to
"What gets me is how any government in NZ, 2011 can get any support at all for the prospect of selling assets."
The answer lies in that which regularly destroys economic prosperity in the west; people want reduced taxes but enhanced services, and they don't see the oxymoronic connection. Selling state assets provides a short period during which a government can bask in the glow of fairyGodMotherhood.
Bart Janssen, in reply to
in the west
????
Western Europe is a high tax high service structure as is Scandinavia.
Craig Ranapia, in reply to
Me too JLM – I am really worried about the level of unbridled power about to wash over us like a tsunami .
First, I guess we should wait a while until the only poll that really matters (tm) is signed, sealed and delivered. :) Otherwise, I don't know how seriously to take all the hand-wringing about "unbridled power". If National ends up enjoying an absolute majority of seats in the next Parliament (which, FWIW, I don't believe will happen) I say that's one for the "democrazy's a bitch, but she's our bitch" file.
I'd also note that even if National is in a position to govern along, we're exceedingly unlikely to see Jar-Jar Binks (Nat - Naboo) move a motion to vest powers in John Key to bring about the creation of the Galactic Empire.
Neil Graham, in reply to
For all the sound and fury, for all the photo opportunities, the polls seem to show that people made up their minds 6 months ago or more.
People may not change to a different party but if they have a sour taste in their mouth about their pick on election day then they might think it's not worth heading down to the voting booth.
democrazy’s a bitch, but she’s our bitch
But as Neil's comment suggests, that's no longer true if a sizeable proportion of voters are disengaged.
In regards to the trade me forum, in my experience it is simply a mindless outlet for mass manipulation and is wall to wall with rightwing ‘operatives’, (a loyal and longstanding crew) making every effort to influence what could potentially be a very large audience comparative to other ‘blogs’ To suggest tm is a valid representation of public opinion is a set up waiting for a punch line ...
we’re exceedingly unlikely to see Jar-Jar Binks (Nat – Naboo) move a motion to vest powers in John Key to bring about the creation of the Galactic Empire
Yeah, but somehow I still don't find the argument "they may be muppets, but they're our muppets" very satisfying...

I’d also note that even if National is in a position to govern along, we’re exceedingly unlikely to see Jar-Jar Binks (Nat – Naboo) move a motion to vest powers in John Key to bring about the creation of the Galactic Empire.
What you mean we haven't created a Galactic Empire already - shit I thought we had that sussed - what are our leaders doing twiddling their thumbs?
Here comes NBR on a "Get Winston" white charger:
I wonder if that story has been waiting in the wings "just in case".

Isn't that pretty much what this government has already done to Christchurch/Canterbury - and got away with? Do we really want to see what Joyce looks like with no checks and balances other than internal party tensions?
Yeah, but somehow I still don’t find the argument “they may be muppets, but they’re our muppets” very satisfying…
Oh, I don’t so why should you? :) But I also don’t find particularly satisfying cursing the outcome of a free, fair and credible election when the outcome isn’t to your liking. Chris Trotter had a typically nasty projectile spew in the Sunday Star Times the day after the last election, and Brash didn’t exactly distinguish himself as a graceful (narrow) loser after the last one.
I wonder if that story has been waiting in the wings “just in case”.
I believe Matt Nippert has been working on this story for a long time (and it’s exactly the kind of financial investigative piece the NBR has done well in the past), but I’m sure the last week has been a welcome hook.
I’m hoping the cock-struck press will decide that now’s an opportune moment to take a look at who might ride into Parliament on Winnie’s coattails. IIRC, 5% will bring in five or six other MPs with Peters. If Andrew Williams is the cream of that crop, we should all be very very nauseated.
My point about TM is that it could give a wider view of the populations views on politics compared with here (liberal/left) Kiwiblog (right/raving ) or the Standard (hard left/raving )
I can't say I have followed it enough to say which way it swings or is swung except it seems to mirror the polls which show about 50% National and quite a few Winston followers who I don't come across in the flesh at all
Rich of Observationz, in reply to
a rantette about how it was so much more difficult these days
You know, and forgive me for being callous, but the absolute locus of this stuff would be the West Coast, and especially people like miners.
Then of course, it comes out that unsafe behaviour became routine, possibly because the workers and management considered such things to be lesbian-imposed political correctness.
The saga has reached the Guardian's Media site although without much comment, yet
RB:
I fondly recall reading there once a warning that I was "an extreme Marxist", which would certainly surprise the folk at The Standard.
lol ;)

I guess you're pretty happy with Phil Goff then, and his trappist vow of silence for the first 18 months of the Key government.
Me, I think the job of the opposition is to oppose, and that starts the day after the election.

I recall there being plenty of perfectly nice and mutually supportive people there -- but also a much higher percentage of angry nutbars than you would find in actual real life.
Mind you, it's got nothing on the Yahoo NZ forums, which tend to make Kiwiblog comments look like Public Address. After all these years, I'm still sometimes amazed at how horrible people feel they can be online.
and their job is to present a viable alternative - another activity that takes a few years, not a few weeks.

It’s the whole cloak of anonymity thing – trolls can get away with saying nasty stuff on the Web that they wouldn’t use in real life. As the #mencallmethings movement goes to show, blowing their cover is the thing they most dread.
And if we ever get our own Anders Breivik, would it force them to pause and think, or just invoke the No True Scotsman clause or worse?

A recent briefing by the King County Public Health Department addressed the recent retraction of Andrew Wakefield’s pivotal, but extremely flawed – fraudulent – article in Lancet. Recall that the initial 1998 publication implicated MMR vaccination in the development of autism and started a trend of significant hesitancy towards vaccination of children. Unfortunately, this hesitancy has become prevalent among parents AND some medical professionals.
Jeffrey S. Duchin, MD, Chief of the Communicable Disease Epidemiology and Immunization Section sent out a memo after the Lancet RETRACTED the original article written by Wakefield. The briefing is directed at providers, but is available on the kingcounty.gov website:
Page one of this briefing is useful for both providers and patients who want to know more about why the medical community has come to find Wakefield’s research unethical and fraudulent and the impact Wakefield’s assertions have made over the past several years. Page two is useful for providers who want to educate patients who still feel dubious about vaccinating their children (which, by the way, is still quite likely, as much of the public is unaware of the momentous Lancet retraction).
Is the medical community beating a dead horse? Probably not. As widely publicized and accepted as Wakefield’s Lancet article was, it will take an even more significant effort to undo the damage done.
“In 2008, there were more cases of measles reported in the US than in any other year since 1997, with >90% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals or in those whose vaccination status was unknown. The current pertussis epidemic in California is the largest since 1955.”
It was a public figure who fueled the controversial fire a few years ago. Is it likely that any celebrity would educate the public about the importance of vaccination as fervently? Perhaps social media and the blogosphere have the power to clean up the mess Wakefield left behind. (Imagine: A big “S” on this blogger’s white coat).

Doha, QATAR – Qatar Airways Group celebrated Qatar’s National Sports Day with fun and excitement attracting more than 1,500 staff and their families for a range of sporting activities.
Staff Celebrate Healthy Living Enjoying Fun Day Out With Colleagues And Families
The event brought smiles and camaraderie all round making the special occasion a great fun day out.
The fun-packed day began bright and early at Doha’s Al Jazeera Academy, offering a wide range of sporting activities, including football, basketball, tennis, cricket and volleyball.
Participants were able to choose from a variety of games on offer at Al Jazeera Academy’s excellent sporting facilities.
The programme also included races and zumba dance classes for children and mums, indoor playground area for children, together with a cafeteria offering snacks and refreshments.
The face painting and henna stations proved extremely popular for children and women.
Special t-shirts and caps featuring the Qatar Airways and National Sports Day logos were distributed to all participants.
The team activities saw competition at its fiercest as airline group employees showed their sporting skills on the field and on court.
The day’s activities came to a close with trophies presented to winning teams. An additional incentive saw an array of raffle prizes on offer donated by local organisations.
More Than 1,500 Participants Turned Up Making The Annual Event A Huge Success For National Airline
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said the airline was delighted with the strong turnout that showed a commitment to supporting the state’s vision promoting sports and healthy living among citizens and expatriates living in Qatar.
“This year, the response from our staff was bigger and better than last year’s celebrations,” he said.
“We see this annual event as a great opportunity for us to bring together our employees and their families for a fun day out. It was a pleasure to see so much team spirit and enthusiasm of our employees. We want them to stay in good health not only for their physical and mental well-being, but also for everyone as a healthy society is what we all strive for.”
National Sports Day is celebrated every second Tuesday of February and is an initiative adopted by the Heir Apparent His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The annual event demonstrates Qatar's desire and dedication to building healthy communities as it also gears up to host the much anticipated 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Qatar Airways has a rich history of lending its full support to sporting events in Doha and overseas, being named the Official Airline of key tournaments in the country’s sporting calendar. These include the men’s and women’s tennis, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open and Qatar Total Open respectively, as well as cycling and golf – the Tour of Qatar and the Qatar Masters – all of which have taken place in the first two months of the year, with many others upcoming.

No, definitely not. If we are a member of say Gymkhana or any of the old Colonial club, started by Britishers, does it make any sense to give up the membership just because in the past, the club used to be patronized by Britishers and there used to be a board at the club gate saying Indians and Dogs are not allowed. What has happened in the past has happened. Today when British are ready to respect and treat us as equal why should we sulk and spoil things by refusing to accept their friendship. Some politicians may propose such ideas. These are the same stupid politicians who think by breaking the ruins of Babri Mazjid we are avenging the insult heaped by some dead barbarian king called Babur.

From Eyewitness News:
A woman battling a long-term illness died in her home in the College Point section of Queens, leaving her toddler to crawl around her lifeless body for hours.
Authorities say 32-year-old Saydie Rentas collapsed in the kitchen of her home on 11th Avenue sometime Thursday afternoon.
Rentas was home with her 21-month-old son, Brian Rodriquez, at the time. Her husband was at work.
She was reportedly dead for at least four hours, and possibly more, when her husband called a neighbor to check on her.
The neighbor, who had a key, went into the house at around 8 p.m. and discovered Rentas' lifeless body.
Authorities say her son was crawling around her body and eating food out of the dog bowl. He was taken to a nearby hospital for observation.
An autopsy conducted Friday morning determined Rentas died from complications of lupus. Her death is not considered suspicious.

So sad.
How sad. Poor baby. :(
umm . peoplee need to get their stories straight , im saydiess step son and in these stories you "writers" swear u get the story straight because 1 . it was lupus . 2 . the baby's fine thank you for asking and 3. the writers . "leaving her toddler to crawl around her lifeless body for hours. " cmmon get a life . was it planed that she would die . "21-month-old son, Brian Rodriquez ." brian is far from his name and he is turning 2 in 2 weeks . so that makes him 23 months . "The neighbor, who had a key" the neighbor didn't have a key . "Authorities say her son was crawling around her body" 1 hes 23 months obviously he knows how to walk and he was laying beside her waiting for her hoping she would wake up. She was an amazing mother and you reporters who don't know crap mind your business . R.I.P Saydiee . <3
Prayers for her family - this is a shame. Unfortunately, it does happen occasionalyy
God bless her and may he watch over her family durning this very difficult time.
Davidd, you need to step away from articles that have minor details wrong, and grieve... and pick up a dictionary so you come across a bit more credible and intelligent.
if u dont knoww what you are talking about dont write nothing . and they diddnt know what they were talking about . they get paid to make stories like this not make stupid mistakes .
@ anonymous... the CHILD just lost his step-mom. people grieve in different ways. have a heart, he's brave for sticking up for what he believes is right.
@ David, i'm so sorry for your loss...don't let the media get to you sweetheart. they are careless sometimes.
From the Family R.I.P Saydie Rentas We all love you and u will be missed tremendously You were a joy to know!! We all know your in a better place and you are One of Gods Angels!!!!
i found out soo sad to kno its was cause lupus i also have it too soo my prayeers go out to them,,
Saydie was one of the most amazing women and wonderful mothers any one could ever ask for. Every one that knew her was a better person for having been in her presence. She always had a kind word and a loving smile, she lit up a room when she entered. Little Dave, my love, don't let these people get to you. As you can see people, most people, do have a heart and do care. We all know who and what Saydie was to all of us. I love all of you guys. Take a piece of Saydie with you and use her as a great example of how to live your life. She loved you and your sister with all of her heart and soul. She was so proud of you guys.
thank youu anonymous and careyy .
Little Dave - I love you, and Saydie loved you SO MUCH! You were always there for her, defending her, protecting her, loving her. We were all blessed to have her in our lived.
And the Anonymous person that said he should pick up a dictionary needs to shut the hell up. He is grieving, the way that a 14-year old boy should! He loved his step-mother, and he know's first hand the crap that was written was done so on a whim - the story was not double-checked and facts were far from correct!
Saydie, this world is a better place because of you - and we are better because you touched our lives in ways that no other could. Rest In Peace Sweetheart. I will always love you.
I am David's godfather. To the individual that made the comment that David should get a dictionary, I say this, apparently tragedy has never come your way. When your heart is in pain and you can not figure why life has thrown such a tragedy your way and your emotions are at a level that you have never experienced, spelling is the last thing you are concerned with. And if this doesn't give you a little better perspective about life and death, then come and see me. I will surely put it in perspective for you in two different colors.... BLACK & BLUE...
Dave senior, Dave Jr, and Jesse I love you all, and you know that I will be always be there for you.
The story was apparently just news for the night; but Sayde was my niece. A loving wife, mom, daughter, and friend to many. She was ill for a very long time; and we are all sure she didn;t just plan to collapse alone leaving RYAN (NOT BRIAN)alone to eat dog food.My family hated this article from the 1st time we read it;but there was so much else that was very important at the time. The story showed no empathy; Lil David had every right to speak up.
It's truly heartbreaking and I hope the family finds peace.

From the Daily News:
Racing to rescue a helpless woman from the clutches of a would-be rapist, Bryan Teichman had just seconds Wednesday to decide whether he should start yelling - or revert to his Marine training and attack the man.
"My gut said to scream first, to avoid the conflict," said the 31-year-old Queens resident. "So I screamed, you know, some profanities, but basically: 'Get off her!'"
That was enough, police said, to send the suspect running - and for Teichman to be hailed as the city's newest hero.
16 comments:
the rapist will be back, just like the rest of the shit that flows in your cesspool city
Where in Whitestone did this happen???
Engaged & committed. This man was engaged to help the victim and took the right decisions to do so to help the victim be freed from the rapist immediately.
When they catch him, they should castrate him with a blunt object and then cut of his tongue so that he cant utter a sound ever again. Then they should cut off his left foot and half his left leg. Amputate his right arm and his left hand. this way this animal can never harm anything ever again..
Uh, does it not strike anybody as very strange that the artist's depiction of the rapist looks EXACTLY like this guy????
Brian doesn't have salt and pepper hair, his eyebrows and width of his jaw are different and he wasn't wearing a red shirt and jean shorts.
this is a great man for geting involved.
Yet again well said AL.........
Great Job! - but I don't know that I would want the reqard of my picture under the title "Rapist ..."
I'll let an anonymous comment left on a NY Times blog speak for me:
“Whenever terrorists attack one of the first things the left worries about is that the victim will "overreact" in their response.
This same line of thinking is how the left became known as the party soft on crime. Whenever someone is raped, the left just wants to make sure that the rapist is not handled roughly by the arresting officers, that the rapist is questioned properly, that people understand the rapist had a tough childhood, that people understand the rapist could have gotten help but Reagan cut the program which would have helped him, that the rapist gets a fair jury, judge and trial and that the rapist does not get an unfairly long sentence, and then when the rapist gets out that he is not unfairly discriminated against as a sex offender in the community, and you know those sex offender registrations go too far and make it so those poor rapists don't get a chance to rehabilitate themselves, and on and on..” –
Comment posted on NY Times blog after an Islamic terrorist group attacked the Taj Hotel in Bombay, India
And where was that "competent police force" at the time of the attack?
When a nabe makes it its business to put out a vibe that it's tough and will take care of its own....would be criminals tend to shun it!
And that's a well proven fact.
i.e.
street crime isn't tolerated in
"protected" neighborhoods like Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Little Italy, etc.
And it ain't the police force that's doing the main protecting there.
Thing is we have a sick individual on the loose in the neighborhood. We all need to be vigilant and keep our eyes open. If you think you see this vile piece of shit, call 911 immediately.
Plaster the area with flyers, watch out for each other, and be alert.
He needs to be caught and he will. Again the guy who helped this woman did what needed to be done, the only shame is that the Police didnt get there in time to catch him. Lets hope he is caught before he strikes again. Stay alert.
And for Our Hero Bryan ;-) SEMPER FI Brother .....
Remember the guy in Brooklyn who did the same thing to a guys sister? No you dont, why? because we took care of him ourselves. nothing elsed eva happened here.
The good samaritian does look alot like the rapist...I thought I was the only reader who thought that....really weird...

Hey, this is great, but where are the international corporations on this list?
We know Pepsi is with us on this issue, but what about other big companies??
I love how you use the slogan "Stop the H8" or "No on H8", yet you have created a blacklist. It is almost comical that you fail to see the irony in the way you are choosing to fight "hate".
Dearest dimwitted Shannon- If a company donated money to back a proposition to take away a woman's right to vote, I wonder if you would boycott that company. Women did not have the right to vote until 1920 in America, a right you now enjoy but never fought for in your life. The mormon and catholic churches (purposely not capitalized) have NEVER supported women's rights in any form. If your rights had been left to a popular vote, you would not be voting today. Also, please note that every time ANYONE does or says ANYTHING that these churches don't like they tell their MILLIONS of followers to boycott. We are not doing anything hateful. We want to be aware of where our money is spent. I refuse to spend my hard earned dollars to support those who think I am less than human. I'm sorry if you find that comical!
The leader of the Yes on 8 campaign said that we don't have "the right" to boycott. You can read this quote for yourself in the majority of the articles from major news sources about yesterday's protests. The fact that this individual believes that we don't have the right to choose where we spend our hard-earned money gives you an immediate sense of how accurately he (and the rest of Yes on 8 supporters) understand the principles of freedom that are intrinsic to America. A boycott isn't about hate, Shannon, it's about choosing not to hand over our money to people who think an entire group of Californians are second-class citizens. It's a choice to stop FUNDING hate.
How interesting that when it is your group who is boycotting, it is acceptable. But, I guarantee if I were to boycott all the gays who contributed to the No on 8 campaign, I would be labeled a bigot. Again, it is almost comical that you fail to see the hypocrisy of your arguments and actions. Seven - targeting specific people who participated in the democratic process not hateful enough for you? How about defacing places of worship? Are you going to come up with some half-baked excuse for how that is perfectly acceptable? OR how about resorting to name calling simply because someone disagrees with your opinion? Is that a good example of hate??
Shannon, you are a dolt. If you boycotted homosexuals for being homosexuals, you wouldn't be LABELED a bigot, you would BE a bigot. I refuse to give any of my money to support a company that will give my money to someone else JUST TO PASS A DISCRIMINATING BILL.
Great list... now I know who to do business with. The list is a double edged sword. By the way... prop 8 passed.
Marriott Hotels (including Fairfield Inns, Springhill Suites, Residence Inns, Courtyards, JW Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, and Renaissance) should be included as well. Although Bill Marriott did NOT actually donate to the campaign, he is a Mormon in good standing (meaning that he tithe to the church - thus, the money you pay at the hotel does in part end up with the church) - and although thes Fairfields, Springhills, most of the the rest are franchises, the do pay "license fees" and other money to Marriott International, which is a major contributor to Mormon-related charities, and a major employer in Utah.
Far from choosing not to do business with those with whom you disagree, many gays are actively disrupting businesses with picketing, vandalism and intimidation. What's your justification for that?
Alex, you are struggling to understand, so let me help you. If you read my post again, you would see where your mistake is. But, just read this one SLOWLY, so you can understand. I did not say I wanted to boycott all gays. My example only referred to boycotting those who contributed to the No on 8 campaign. See, YOUR example of boycotting all gays regardless of their involvement in Prop 8 would be considered bigoted. In fact, your example is more akin to what the GLBT community is doing right now by targeting all Mormons, regardless of their involvement in Prop 8. The post just after yours is a wonderful example of the bigotry I am referring to. You guys are going to boycott Bill Marriott, not because he contributed to the Yes on 8 campaign, or even voted Yes(since he does not live in Cali), but simply because he is a Mormon. I don't think you can get a more blaring example of bigotry than that. Is that clear enough for you, Alex? Or do I need to use smaller words?
O ye hypocrites!
Shannon. You're a bigot. And you obviously see gays and lesbians as less-than, or not deserving of the same rights everybody else gets. We're free to boycott, which is a perfectly acceptable method of protest. You're free to not spend your money at gay-owned businesses, or those that donated against Prop 8, *even though* gays getting married wouldn't harm you personally. This harms us personally, do you see the difference? If not, please just go elsewhere and stop posting your annoyingly obtuse comments here.
S.S.L - What you fail to see or understand is that I simply disagree with you. You can call me a bigot all you want(it must make you feel better), but in so doing, you are highlighting the problem that your side fails to acknowledge. Are there some people who are Yes on 8 who hate gays and think that they are all going to hell? Absolutely. Are there lots of people(like me)who have nothing against gays, but would just like to keep the traditional definition of marriage? And do those people also believe(as I do) that gays who form a union should have all the rights that I do as a married person? ABSOLUTELY! I also don't believe that people should have premarital sex or drink alcohol. I don't hate the people that do those things, nor do I think they are going to hell. I just disagree.
You can continue screaming, Lemur, but constantly yelling "Bigot!" at someone just for disagreeing with you will never advance your cause.
everybody, listen up!! shannon is incapable of understanding rational, compassionate thoughts and arguments, so stop wasting your precious time and energy on her....she's nothing but a bigot and will never be able to pull her head far enough out of her own ass to see reality. let it go!! dedicate your focus toward people with loving hearts...people who are confused, not people who have no soul.
And that last post is a perfect example of why you have lost the same sex marriage battle in 30 states in just 4 years. Heaven forbid you actually listen to someone who respectfully disagrees with you!
Shannon - whoever you are - the reason they keep calling you slow and a bigot, and the reason you keep failing to understand, is the fact that, forgetting everything Prop 8 has to do with personal beliefs, Prop 8 is blatantly against the 14th Amendment of our United States Constitution. If you have a problem with basic civil rights, feel free to move to a country that enjoys discriminating against its own citizens.
The fact that something that takes away a citizens equal rights (no, sorry, California domestic partnership laws are NOT the same as marriage, no matter how many people have brainwashed you into believing this) was allowed to be on our ballot is appalling, and you should be ashamed to call yourself an American.
If you're proud of such a thing tainted by personal beliefs and bigotry to be allowed on an American voting ballot, then you, my friend, have no faith in the American way, and whether you are Christian, atheist, white, black, rich, or poor - you are still a bigot.
Hey Shannon! How are you? Your family? Friends? Did you have a good week? I'm doing well, just here doing what I can to make my little voice heard. I believe everyone should be treated equally so I was against prop 8. I also believe that you can't change the way people think or feel, the only true change you can make is the changes you make in your life. So I try to treat people the way I'd like to be treated, be more tolerant and think before I speak. I've never been to a YES ON 8 website or bulletin, there is nothing I can say that will change their minds, they'll only see me as an irritant. Besides, I would rather spend my time talking to friends, hanging out with family, being with the people I love... but that's just me.
Take care of yourself :)
Melissa Martine
Meliisa - I am doing well. Thanks! Unlike you, I had been on many No on 8 websites before the election because I always strive to understand the other person's viewpoint. But it seems as if the NO on 8 side has no desire to understand the other side. I post on here, because it takes all of 5 minutes and it's really easy to do. Unlike protesting in front on places of worship(where you will only be seen as an irritant), or roaming the streets of Los Angeles for hours and hours, stopping up traffic.
Katie - As I said in my previous post, I think you should have all the rights that married couples do, just call it something different(you know, the same thing Elton John said. Is he a bigot too?). So you would then have all the same rights. And there would be no civil rights issue. See? Also, I find it a little strange that you asked me if I am proud to have voted according to my personal beliefs. Well, doesn't everyone vote according to there personal beliefs???
Shannon - you described your presence on this website the best "(where you will only be seen as an irritant)"
How about we get marriage and you get civil unions, its the same thing, you are happy right?
QU - maybe a little irritation is good. Isn't that what you guys are doing with all of those protests - irritating people? Actually, I think the state should only do civil unions for all people and leave marriage up to the churches. I'm disappointed in you QU. I mistakenly thought the reason you didn't delete posts that disagreed with your side was because you were open to listening to other people's viewpoints. Guess I was wrong. I understand that those on this site might feel threatened by someone who is making a valid point.
I don't delete your posts because you are entitled to your opinion, just not entitled to the right to force your agenda on us and to destroy the constitution.
As for being threatened by your points, that is laughable.
I will ask your for the third time, how about we get marriage and you get civil unions, its the same thing straight people, why do you want special rights?
QU - I don't really have an agenda, but you guys certainly do. And wouldn't trying to overturn something that the majority of the people voted for be considered forcing one's agenda?
You've only asked me twice(but hey, who's counting?), and I think I answered your question pretty clearly. In fact, I am surprised that you even suggested something that goes so against your strong beliefs of everyone being equal(so in case that wasn't clear, I don't think your idea is a good one). But, I'll explain my position AGAIN. I would like to keep the traditional definition of marriage. But, if I could choose, I would make it so that marriage was not used at all as a means of determining benefits at the state or federal level. Everyone would have a civil union because that is fair and equal.
Now I have a question for you. It seems that even your definition of marriage would still exclude some people. What about the asexuals that don't want to get married? Why are they discriminated against by the government(in terms of receiving tax breaks, etc) just because they don't have the desire to marry someone. In fact, marriage in general discriminates against all single people. And why? Just because they are single. How unfair! And what about polygamous relationships? What if three people love each other? Are you including them in your fight for the "basic right" to marry?
Shannon - I am fine with federal civil unions only for gay and lesbian couples, but that means no marriage for heterosexual couples either. We all get civil unionized, fine.
Some asexuals want to get married some don't, marriage equality is about having the right to marry the person you love or not to marry anyone if you don't want to. I also don't want single people to be lacking any benefits and yes I support people who are polyamorous and believe in group marriage if that makes people happy.
It's good to see that you are at least consistent in your views. I bet you never thought you would find some common ground with a "bigot".
Shannon - I don't believe I ever referred to you as a bigot. I often find common ground with people when they come up with logical ideas.
QU - I know you didn't refer to me as a bigot. But just about everybody else that posted did. I did want to get back to the whole reason I posted to begin with, which was to point out that it is unfair and hateful to protest people who had nothing to do with the Prop 8 vote(like Bill Marriott). And if the roles were reversed and Prop 8 had not passed, and we had started creating blacklists and protesting those who had contributed to the NO on 8 campaign(regardless of whether they are gay or straight), you guys would be decrying us as haters and bigots.
arg! enough with Shannon..
I'm compiling a list of donors in my town....if they own a business they are going to get no business from me.
It's very important to keep the discussion open with all the Shanons out there. She is just as hard-headed as we are. Yelling "bigot" does nothing to encourage someone to change their mind (remember caucusing?)
When Shannon says we already have civil unions and should be content with that, she should be reminded that black and white drinking fountains look just the same as well. No one is trying to change the definition of marriage. Just make it more inclusive. The slippery slope argument about polygamists and incestuous relationships is just avoiding the issue at hand, but it does show us that she equates gay relationships to these other groups.
For us, it is unfathomable to punish children with gay parents by not allowing the parents to marry all because a word in the dictionary might have a wider meaning.
It appears that most of the population is made up of Shannons, who are certain that they are protecting something sacred; something unchanged for millennia. But of course, marriage has been in constant change for all of that time, or maybe it hasn't... Perhaps Shannon will have to acquire a sizable dowry before any marriage on her part could be considered.
She needs to look inside of herself, examine these beliefs and then decide if they really represent the good she thinks she is doing.
tara-please share that list with us whenever you compile it.
anon-i think the slippery slope argument is silly, marriage is the union of 2 people, so whether it is a man-woman, man-man, woman-woman, it is still two people which doesn't anymore open the door for polygamy.
Prop 8 isn't a violation of anyone's equal rights. If you are a gay man, you are free to marry a woman, just like a straight man. Similarly, straight men and gay men are treated equally, in that neither can "marry" another man.
That is why this isn't the same as banning interracial marriage. In that case, a black man can't marry a white woman the same as a white man - black and white men are treated differently with respect to their ability to marry white women. The black man is denied a right solely because he is black.
An equal rights violation would be if straight men were allowed to marry women, but gay men were not - that would be denying the gay man equal rights based on their sexual preference. The fact that gay men don't want to marry women doesn't mean they are denied equal rights.
"Far from choosing not to do business with those with whom you disagree, many gays are actively disrupting businesses with picketing, vandalism and intimidation. What's your justification for that?"
If I'm being attacked, I'm going to attack back. It's called self-defense.
Unfortunately the federal government does not agree with the above post. As a gay man, I have NO right to get married. If I were to marry a female, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement would define it as a fraudulent, 'sham' marriage.
I found this link, and had hoped to find a neatly prepared list of companies that we could, as a group, boycott to show our displeasure with their choice and persuade them to spend their money more wisely. Instead, what I find is a board of "rants and raves" against each other. Are we fighting for the same cause? If so, let's get some organization here, and compile an accurate list of organizations that supported Prop 8.....
Cal Net Technology and it's owner Zach Schuler are SUPER prop 8 supporters.
Last I checked, anyone in CA could get married, as long as they followed the rules regarding marrying a member of the opposite sex. So, what right was taken away?
Marriage is a religious institution…respect it for anyone with any one or get rid of it all together. Civil unions for everyone.
My wife and I are considering divorce out of solidarity for our gay brothers and sisters.
LOL "all men are free to marry a woman" is like passing a law that says "everyone is free to worship Jesus any way they like, but not anyone else"... it applies equally to everyone, so where's the problem?
The problem is that Muslims and pagans, etc, are not free to worship Jesus without denying part of who they are.
Likewise, gay men are not actually "free" to marry women without denying their sexuality.
The other way to point out your fallacy goes like this:
A man and a woman are each interested in a third person... one of them is allowed to marry that person and the other isn't... the only difference between them is their sex/gender. How is that not gender discrimination?
How is that not exactly like your example of interracial marriage where a black man and a white man each want to marry a woman, but one can and one can't, and the only difference between them is race?
Oooooh this is fun. I'm liking Shannon. He does have a point, but it's not the one that he thinks he has....
Ooooh, and BTW, where's the master-list of companies to avoid doing business with because of their anti-LGBTQ policies?
I know Exxon/Mobil and Wal*Mart are on that list but, who else?
Boycotts cut both ways. Everyone has access to the Gay Yellow Pages, too. I think LGBT supporters and members need to think before they get involved in an anti-hetertosexual campaign.
Defending oneself against hate is not hate. It just isn't.
Why in the world would I want to give $$ to people who will turn around and use it to prevent me from marrying?? There is nothing wrong with this list. As a matter of fact, thank God for it...
I was at the airport a while back, and saw a book. A neatly compiled listing of all the companies that supported Focus on the Family(a very ANTI-gay organization). Now, Focus on the Family donates to many anti-gay causes...even Yes on Prop 8. With that said, those companies obviously have an agenda that they are supporting and may be contributing to other ANTI-gay causes and organizations. I didn't buy the book I saw at the airport at that time; However, I am actively pursuing a copy now. Shannon made me realize that I don't want to support people that believe in(and actively try to leagally enforce) discrimination.
I have some friends that do not believe in gay equality. This doens't mean that I can't be their friend, it simply means we disagree. However, I'm certainly not going to give them money that they will use to support a cause that discriminates against me. I don't hate my friend,...I just love me enough to fight for what I believe in. Besides, I have to right to spend my money where-ever I choose.
So, I believe the best thing to do is go to the source. If corp A donates to ORG B, and ORG B supports CAUSE C(who is historically anti-gay), then don't shop with CORP A or ORG B. Those places are all the sources of funding. It makes sense. And Shannon, please understand that we(a majority of us anyway) don't hate these places, we just have to support ourselves and protect ourselves from those out to hurt us(like Prop 8).
I'm not going to post again, I just wanted to sound out my thought son the matter and this is what it is.
Best wishes,
BW
getting back to the list itself:
I'm amazed at how many bigot dentists there are...
Just re-hashing this thread for those who haven't seen it.
If you have explain to someone that there is a difference between having an open dialogue about marriage equality AND taking rights away from people, that person is not worth your time. Let's back to this: No gay money for antigay bigots. Thanks, QU for posting this list and any updates.
can't we all start referring to it as "civil marriage" (The catholic church came up with the term, btw) to make the point clearer?
When I was settled and could choose I did business only with gay owned/friendly businesses in NOLA; it was not some social statement, it was just a feeling of being comfortable and able to do business without being snubbed or slighted while doing things I had to. Whenever I found this to not be the case, as in overhearing the owner of the only two laundries in the Quarter refer to us as fags, I took my business elsewhere. [Yes I took my laundry out of his dryers and left, the ferry ran on the hour and I didn't have this problem across the river.] But the main reason I felt obligated to do strictly gay business is for the same reason I feel we should all do business with small businesses; support of those trying to make it just like we are. A multi-national corporation's board doesn't give a D about the loss of one customer; however, a small or gay business usually does--especially a regular customer--because it does impact on their bottom line. Myself and about a dozen of my fellow workers even started making a weekly group trip across the river for a laundry without attitude and even closed a couple of smaller bigot shops by refusing to do business with them. You know the axiom: "Telephone, telegraph, tell a queen" and once it was out the majority (read this as gay) of the Quarter's residents quit doing business there. I do not apologise for these actions anymore than I would have someone apologise for the Montgomery bus boycott. It is my money and I do have the right to chose. I feel that if we all were more "selective" in our choices we would have more friendly choices available.
After all is said and done:
1) someone will run a laundry, grocer, clothier, etc. no matter what--they want to be successful.
2) If their personal opinions and actions costs them their business--to bad.
3) when they lose that business due to those actions someone--hopefully with a more accepting and friendly attitude--will open a replacement for the failed business.
Just simple economics; You either chose or lose.
You chose to be treated less important to a business or you chose to not go back and let it be known (to all around you) that THIS is the reason you chose NOT to do business there.

TEXTILES GOING TO NEW MARKETS; These Exports and Shutting Out of Foreign Goods Cause Activity in Mills.
There seems to be no question that the European war has exerted as a whole a beneficial effect on the textile manufacturing industry of the United States. At the present time the industry occupies probably a stronger position than at any other period in its history. The factors in this situation are the shutting out to a very large extent of foreign competition on the one hand and the enormous "war orders" on the other.

NBC and Its Stations Venture Into Online Video Market
By SAUL HANSELL
Published: September 13, 2006
Hoping to profit from the fragmented market for video on the Internet, NBC Universal has created a new company that will distribute video programming to various Internet sites.
The new venture, called the National Broadband Company, or NBBC, will have content from NBC's networks and local stations as well as from other companies. That programming will appear on NBC's own Web sites as well as other sites.
Commercials will be inserted before each video segment, with the revenue split among the program's creator, the Web site owner and NBBC.
NBC was spurred to rethink its traditional business model earlier this year when Lazy Sunday, a sketch from ''Saturday Night Live,'' became a hit across the Internet. Some people recorded the sketch and uploaded it to YouTube, the popular video-sharing site. Then other people used technology from YouTube to put the video directly on their own blogs or pages on MySpace, the social networking site.
''When 'Saturday Night Live' had a great clip of Lazy Sunday, YouTube made a lot of money off it,'' Randy Falco, the president of the NBC Universal television group, said at a news conference yesterday. ''In the future, when we have a Lazy Sunday clip, NBBC will make a lot of money on it.''
NBC executives liken the business to the television syndication market, in which producers sell programs to local stations or cable networks.
''We want to create new tools to allow NBC Universal to do what it has always done: to deliver quality entertainment experiences to as broad an audience as possible,'' Mr. Falco said. ''In short, we are going back into the broadcast business on the Internet.''
NBBC is a joint venture between NBC Universal (which in turn is controlled by General Electric) and NBC's affiliate stations, which own about one-third of the company. Local stations hope that the syndication market will provide new outlets for the news and entertainment programs they produce, and they hope to add video from the marketplace to their own sites.
''If we really want to compete with big aggregators like Yahoo and Google, we need our video in as many places as possible,'' Mr. Falco said.
Google is, in fact, a direct competitor with NBBC. It plans to distribute video content to other Web sites, accompanied by advertising, starting with a deal for programming from Viacom's cable networks. AOL is also preparing to distribute its own video content and content from its partners on other Web sites. And there are many start-up companies with various approaches to video syndication, including Brightcove, Roo, Revver and Broadband Enterprises.
NBC is seeking a much higher proportion of the advertising revenue from running the syndication business than other players in the market. In cases where NBBC sells the advertising, it expects to give about 30 percent of the revenue to the program producer and 20 percent to the site on which the video is shown, and to keep 50 percent for itself, according to an executive familiar with the company's deals. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity because the financial terms of the contracts are confidential. Moreover, the revenue splits can vary significantly depending on the clout of the partner.
Still, NBC's approach is sharply different from Google's, which would give the majority of advertising revenue to the content creator. Broadband Enterprises, which had syndicated NBC video until yesterday, Brightcove and Revver all take closer to one-third of the advertising revenue.
Michael Steib, the general manager of NBC Universal's strategic ventures unit, which created NBBC, declined to discuss the specifics of the company's financial arrangements. But he said that content creators would find dealing with NBBC lucrative.
For now, NBBC has been able to attract a collection of prominent programmers that will at least test its system, including CNET, Forbes and the About.com unit of The New York Times Company. The company has attracted some participation from NBC's largest rivals, including the College Sports TV unit of CBS, IGN Entertainment from the News Corporation and several properties of Discovery Communications.
NBBC has made it easy for producers to try its system because it does not ask for exclusive rights to programs.
''It is so early that who knows who has the right formula?'' said Mark Larkin, an executive producer at CNET. ''It seems like aligning ourselves with a brand like NBC is a pretty safe bet.''
At first, NBBC will distribute programs under seven minutes. Over time, it may experiment with longer programs.

I'm tucked up in my basement studio wondering if it is too soon to start a fire in my wood stove! It's definitely chilly, but I know when I fire up the beast, I'll soon open the windows and doors and try not to cook. This is one powerful wood stove....and it HEATS.
I do love the coziness and crackle of a wood fire....and candles burning....and hot tea in a big mug! My favorite things about late fall/winter.
The 3rd quilt is on the bed, adding a delicious weight and keeping all the warmth in. I love sleeping all tucked up, surrounded in my little quilt cocoon, one cat on either side preventing me from rolling in either, or any, directon! I think the best sleep comes with a cold nose, don't you agree?
This morning I was pondering on the feeling of GRATITUDE. Here in the US, our Thanksgiving is approaching. And you know what? This past 10 days off has given me the opportunity to just slow down and be grateful for little things.
The change of season outdoors, the smell of autumn in the air, the beauty of the falling leaves, the adventure of making it from the backdoor to the hottub without being beaned by falling acorns!
Are you too busy, too rushed, too hectic, so much on your plate that you don't even think about the joy of feeling grateful? I know I have been guilty of this. I'm not talking necessarily feeling grateful in any kind if "religious" way. We all have our own convictions, I am just talking about the little ordinary-every-day beauties that we can miss in our rush to get to the next "to-do" on our lists. There is joy in the mundane routine day-in-day-out doings. We just have to see them and acknowledge them with a smile and a nod to life for giving it to us so abundantly.
Okay, so this post isn't even quilt-related. It's just how I'm feeling this morning. But to put a bit of quilt-speak in here, I've been BUSY! The mystery quilt is now quilted, and I'm ready to start binding! HA! ((How's that for rubbing it in?!)) And I am loving the chatter I am reading on the quiltville friends page on facebook, and on the quiltvillechat@yahoogroups.com list about the colors that people are planning on and the excitement is building....and I am so grateful for all of this abundance too!
I'm busy quilting a baby quilt for a friend expecting her first grandchild. I'm sure she is feeling excitement and gratitude.....it's palpable! The expectation.....
Today is also a mundane chore kind of day, but I'm doing it with gratitude. I'm doing laundry! ((But I have a stacked hi-efficiency washer and dryer, I'm not pounding clothing on a rock down by the river!)) I've got book orders to mail out! ((I'm grateful for each and every one of those orders and the people they bring across my path!)) I've got to pack a suitcase, repack the trunk show, get all settled and sorted for a trip to Michigan in the morning. ((I'm grateful to be flying and to be there in a few short hours, vs DRIVING it like I did last October!))
Let's face it! If the worst thing that happens to me today is crawling groggily out of a warm bed and stepping barefootedly into dog puke on the way to the bathroom...I've got it pretty darned great!
I have my eyes to see, my ears to hear, my heart to love, my hands to sew. I have a roof over my head, a beyond-life-expectancy basement full of fabric and miscellaneous quilt-neccessities. I have family, terrific friends, and you.
For it all...I'm grateful!
Thank you Bonnie. Sometimes we focus on the negatives and we forget to bethankful for the things and people that ae in our life.
I really enjoyed reading your post Bonnie. No I do not like a cold nose, I tuck my head under the blankets in the winter. Here In Aussie though it is getting hotter.
Thank you for sharing.
Thank you Bonnie! Once in a while we all need to be reminded of how well off we are.
To quote my hubby: "Dog puke washes off!"
You 2 have opened my eyes this morning.......pity party over!
Ditto! Just taking in clean, cold fresh air, makes me grateful. My list goes on and on. Grateful to have a machine to quilt with, unlike my ancestors. Grateful to have a computer to talk to people almost anywhere in the world. Grateful that those same people are willing to share their fabulous ideas and their quilts. Grateful that my thumbs don't hurt today. Grateful...
One of my favorite sayings is "Deal with the negatives, but focus on the positives". True is all cases.....even quilting!
Marcia in Missouri
Bonnie....your thoughts and words are so lovely today. I'm grateful for all the inspiration you and your site gives me. My life has actually changed since finding Quiltville! I know that sounds corny and odd, but its true!
You've given me clarity when looking at all this fabric that surrounds me, and that clarity has spilled over into everything I do! I'm so much more productive now, in quilting and in life. And the excitement I get from that, well, it just compounds into more ideas and accomplishments!
I think I was wasting an awful lot of time before, with nothing to show for it, and nothing gained.
Thanks for all the inspiration! We're all very grateful to you!
Regan :o)
This was a rough week for our family. Dd troubles. But, I'm feeling grateful too. We still have each other and SO much to be thankful for, and youthful troubles will have an end even if some suffering must be endured. Love will get us through. Thank you for the distractions, for helping my heart to heal and for keeping my mind occupied when time is needed. I have my colors & fabrics chosen. LOL, I can't find my patience though! I'm ready to START and feel like begging you to give me a tedious/time consuming part to start on!
THANK YOU for making my life better, you are SUCH a blessing,
Lucy (in IN)
Have a happy and grateful day. I've also been enjoying the change of weather and the excess of projects to keep my hands busy while my brain works on other things...like resting. Enjoy! Lane
Well said. I like this. The optimist may be proven wrong in the end, but they have a much better journey than the pessimist.
even with a little fire in the fireplace ours heats the house too hot, we only use it when we loose power - but it is always so lovely to look at.
Karen
There is just something about this season that brings forth the nostalgia in us. I think we associate the smells and crisp weather with comfort. At least I do :) The comfort of family and friends; of joy and tradition.
Enjoy your day and thank you for the reminder to enjoy mine.
Amen,Bonnie! I am blessed to tears. So much to be thankful for. And BTW, I am thankful for you! Yes, you. For your skill and generosity and place in this quilting world. Thank you!
I too have been reminding myself how grateful I am to be able to do the things I do even those things that are not my favorite :0)
Thanks Bonnie,
I needed to read a positive post...just got back from an emergency run to the local auto dealer after barely being able to get my car running. I am grateful that DH was following me in our diesel truck so I had a way home.....
Appreciate the timing!
Great post, Bonnie.
I was just laying in bed last night. with the extra quilt on my bed thinking how heavy it all feels, and how my husband loves that feeling. I, personally, do not enjoy heavy covers . . . but I love the warmth they provide.
Just wonderful!!!Thankyou.I think everyone is guilty of running and not taking time to see a beautiful spiderweb with dew on it (my heart sings when I 'see' those!)Or to see a child just content on being.....Keep warm in all your quilts as we will be taking them off her in N.Z. :-)
Bonnie, what a lovely gracious entry today on your blog. We followers are thankful for you.
AMEN. I also try to focus on gratefulness, everyday. Thank you.
And I for one am grateful for you! Just wanted you to know that so many of us enjoy these mysteries and I have decided I am never happier than when I have one going...so I intend to just always have a quiltville project or two going...gotta do what I can to bring on bliss. Thanks for doing your part!
Bonnie, you're the best! Thank you for reminding me of how very blessed I am. I absolutely love the first line of your last paragraph: "I have my eyes to see, my ears to hear, my heart to love, my hands to sew." May I add that with my sewing hands, I have the ability to create, express my inner self and bring joy to others. We are all so blessed and should be thankful every day for the opportunity to just be.
Thank you for your thoughtful post - my heart is full of gratitude for the richness of my life - family, friends, health and a great network (face to face and online) of shared knowledge and experience from which to draw inspiration.
well said Bonnie.
A beautiful post!

Baseball Hosts Fairleigh Dickinson With Senior Day Slated For Saturday, May 7
Quinnipiac University (11-29, 10-10 NEC) vs.
Fairleigh Dickinson University (10-31, 5-15 NEC)
May 7-8, 2010
Quinnipiac Baseball Field - Hamden, Conn.
Senior Weekend
Quinnipiac will host Fairleigh Dickinson on Friday, May 7 and Saturday, May 8 at the Quinnipiac Baseball Field in Hamden, Conn. for a two-day, four-game Northeast Conference series. On Friday, Quinnipiac and FDU will hit the field at 12 Noon for a nine-inning game, followed by a seven-inning game. They are also scheduled to play at 12 p.m. on Saturday, this time with a seven-inning game followed by a nine-inning game. Quinnipiac is currently 11-29 overall and 10-10 in the NEC, tied for fifth place in the conference standings. Fairleigh Dickinson is 10-31 overall and 5-15 in conference play.
Playoff Picture
Bryant (15-5) currently sits in first place in the NEC standings, but the Bulldogs are not eligible for postseason play until the 2010-11 season. With that, Sacred Heart (12-8) currently holds the top seed in the NEC Tournament. Wagner (11-9) sit behind the Pioneers, and will host Sacred Heart this weekend. Monmouth (13-11) took three of four against the Bobcats this past weekend to shoot into third place. The Hawks are off this weekend. Central Connecticut and Quinnipiac are currently tied for the fourth and final spot in the conference tournament. Quinnipiac took three of four against CCSU two weekends ago and will face ninth-place Fairleigh Dickinson this weekend. Central Connecticut State will face sixth place Mount St. Mary's (11-13) in Emmitsburg, Md.
Corner Outfield With Some Pop
Ben Farina (Waterford, Conn.) continued his hot hitting this week, as the third-year left fielder posted a .476 (10-21) average with a pair of doubles. Farina was 2-for-4 against Monmouth in the first game of the Bobcats' four-game series, and followed that up with a 5-for-8 doubleheader, including a 4-for-4 day that produced two RBI's in the nightcap of the twinbill.
Making History
Farina became the 17th player in Quinnipiac history to reach the 160-hit mark, and the 14th in the University's Division I history. He is also the Bobcats only active hitter with two 50-hit seasons in his career.
Benny The Bat
Farina is second on the team with 15 multiple-hit games, including seven in his last 11 games out.
Quietly Making His Way To The Front Of The
Line
For the year, Farina leads the Bobcats in average (.350), runs scored (31), hits (56) and doubles (11) while his slugging percentage (.438) and on-base percentage (.390) both rank second.
Good
Week Mike
Mike Bartlett (Milford, Conn.) continued his consistent hitting against Northeast Conference competition as he hit .500 (6-12) against Monmouth for the weekend series. Bartlett strung together three-straight two-hit performances against the Hawks, pushing his season average against the NEC to .316. Barlett has reached base safely in 17 of Quinnipiac's 18 conference games, while recording a hit in 13 of them.
Back
To Back Home Run Games
Chris Migani (Orange, Conn.) and Brian Monack (Branford, Conn.) both homered in both games of Saturday's doubleheader against Monmouth. For the year, Monack leads Quinnipiac with seven homeruns, 36 RBI, as well as a .507 slugging percentage and a .413 on-base percentage. Monack's 23 bases-on-balls lead Quinnipiac, while his 30 runs scored rank second. Migani is second on the roster with four homeruns, while also driving in 20 runs.

Men's Basketball Falls To Robert Morris, 64-62, In NEC Semifinals
HAMDEN, Conn. - Justin Rutty (Newburgh, N.Y.) had nine points and 10 rebounds to become the Northeast Conference's all-time leading rebounder (1,025), but the Quinnipiac University men's basketball team was defeated by Robert Morris, 64-62, Sunday afternoon at the TD Bank Sports Center. With the loss, the Bobcats fall to 22-9, while the Colonials improve to 18-13 and move on to Wednesday's NEC Tournament Championship Game at top-seeded Long Island. The Bobcats now wait for a potential at-large invitation to a postseason tournament.
Rutty passed Central Connecticut's Ron Robinson (1,022) for first all-time among Northeast Conference rebounders. Deontay Twyman (Olney, Md.) had a team-high 14 points, while James Johnson (Queens, N.Y.) added 13 points. Dave Johnson (Jackson, N.J.) contributed 10 points and a game-high nine assists.
Coron Williams scored a game-high 15 points for Robert Morris, while Lijah Thompson and Russell Johnson contributed 14 points each. Velton Jones added 13 points, eight assists and three steals for the Colonials.
In total, the game saw 22 lead changes and 12 ties. Quinnipiac built its largest lead of the game on Dominique Langston's (Bridgeport, Conn.) fast-break lay-up at the 1:43 mark of the first half. Russell Johnson responded immediately with a three-pointer at the 1:23 mark and the teams traded two-point buckets to give Quinnipiac a four-point cushion at the half.
Robert Morris scored the first six points of the second half to take a two-point lead. The advantage swelled to as many as four on Yann Charles' jumper at the 15:30 mark. Following nine lead changes and five ties, Russell Johnson's lay-up with 1:58 left in regulation re-established the Colonials' four-point lead. Twyman then buried a three-pointer with 1:36 remaining and followed by drawing a charge on Lijah Thompson. Dave Johnson was then fouled and made two free throws with 57 seconds left, giving Quinnipiac a one-point lead, 62-61.
Russell Johnson drew a foul with 41 seconds left. He made the first free throw, but missed the second. The long rebound was tipped around and out of bounds. After a discussion including all three referees, Robert Morris was awarded possession with 38.8 seconds left. The Colonials drained nearly all of the shot clock before Jones hoisted a floater from the right hip from just outside the lane that fell straight through.
With just over four seconds remaining in regulation, the Bobcats inbounded to James Johnson, whose last-second three-point attempt fell short.
For the game,rebounded Robert Morris, 41-25.

Daisuke Matsuzaka won his 16th game last night, in what was arguably his best performance of the season as the Red Sox whacked the White Sox, 8-0, on their return home after a very successful road trip.
Despite not having Mike Lowell, J.D. Drew, Sean Casey, Josh Beckett and Coco Crisp (out last night with flu-like symptoms), the Red Sox made it look easy against Chicago. They are just so deep and resilient, and are finding ways to win.
Dice-K tied the record for most wins in MLB in a season by a Japanese-born pitcher, which was set by Hideo Nomo. He is now 16-2. He went eight innings last night, striking out seven and allowing just two hits while walking two. He was never in trouble, as the offense gave him all the support he needed from the first inning.
Dustin Pedroia had four hits, along with a walk and two stolen bases, and David Ortiz had three hits as well. Kevin Youkilis had two hits and three RBI. Jason Bay was having a tough night, with two strikeouts, until his blow put the game out of reach. The Sox were up 4-0 with the bases loaded with two outs in the sixth when Bay blasted one off the wall to clear the bases and put the Sox up, 7-0.
Pedroia also scored twice, and broke Bobby Doerr's 1950 team record for runs scored by a second baseman. Dusty now has 104 runs scored, and you have to think he will now start getting some MVP votes with the spectacular year he is putting together.
Tampa Bay won over Baltimore, and Minnesota won in Oakland, so the Red Sox remain 4 1/2 behind the Rays in the East, and 2 1/2 up on the Twins in the wild card race.
Before the game the Red Sox got some good news about Josh Beckett's elbow, as there appears to be now damage inside, as he visited Dr. James Andrews in Alabama yesterday. They did place him on the DL also, but he will only be on it for another week, as he has not pitched since August 17th. He will start in Texas next weekend. The Red Sox also placed Sean Casey on the DL with his continuing neck pain, and brought up catcher David Ross. They will bring up highly touted rookie Michael Bowden from Pawtucket tonight to make his MLB debut.

I don't like driving very much. That makes me very unhappy, because I scream a lot in the car, but other than that, life is actually pretty good.

This is Dajia soaking wet and having fun!
Dajia is face down over one of the holes where water spurts up out of. She'd seen water come out of it; however, didn't grasp the concept that water was going to come out again.
Here comes the water...watch out!
Standing in the water!
Point Defiance also has a new carosuel ride. Here's another place that Dajia screamed uncontrollably once we took her off (after two rides).

Over on TyrantOidipous.com I’ve posted my first Journal entry, a blog about my long-standing fascination with the play Oidipous Tyrannos (Oedipus Rex), which Davd Vine and I have just translated, as Tyrant Oidipous. I thought I would post it here as well. First, the link to the other site is here.
Recently on Facebook, Camelia Elias, publisher of Tyrant Oidipous, quoted one of her favorite moments from the play, when the blind seer Teiresias denounces Oidipous. The two of them have been jousting, sneering at each other, accusing each other, and Teiresias is about to leave when suddenly he states:
“I declare that unawares you live with those closest to you
in a shameful bond. You do not see that you are doing something evil.”
I was struck by her singling out this speech and wrote the following reply.
“Camelia, this is a wonderful moment to feature. Besides its inherent drama, it shows us the power of the oracular voice. Before this there has been a somewhat comic battle of egos between Oidipous and Teiresias, a kind of “Oh yeah? Well, take that!” But when Teiresias speaks as the seer something very different emerges, a divine aspect. It’s interesting that with so much on Delphi and the “message” from the oracle (as Oidipous puts it) we never actually learn the precise words of Apollo spoken by the Pythia (the woman who delivers the prophecy at Delphi). The only time we experience the real divine voice it’s through the seer.”
Now, thinking about this some more, I thought it might be interesting to explore the image of Teiresias.
Teiresias is portrayed in the play, and elsewhere, especially the Odyssey, as the very image of a seer. Originally the name may have described a whole class of people, diviners and what today we would call psychics. Mythology, the power of stories, has made Teiresias a single figure who appears in many tales. The name has various interpretations, and is sometimes translated (loosely) as “Delights in signs,” in other words, someone who goes deeply into the oracular experience. T. S. Eliot said that Teiresias was the secret hero of his great poem, The Wasteland, a true modern epic.
Teiresias has long fascinated me. Described as a blind hermaphrodite who sees everything, s/he would seem to be an alchemical figure who transcends ordinary humanity. There are various stories, some just jokes, really, of how Teiresias became a blind seer. One states that because he was first a man, then a woman, and then a man again, he was asked to judge an argument between Zeus and Hera over whether men or women enjoy sex more. In typical married couple manipulation, each one insisted the other side had the advantage. So they decided to ask the only person who had been both. Teiresias said that if enjoyment were ten parts, women would have nine and men one. Furious, Hera struck him blind, then Zeus, to compensate, gave him the power of oracular sight. This is clearly a kind of sit-com gloss on mythology!
Sophocles treats the issues of seeing, blindness, and knowing much more intensely. Oidipous ridicules Teiresias’s blindness, treating him as someone handicapped and therefore weak, despite Teiresias’s clear power. At the end of the play, after his own desire for the truth has made him see the reality of who he is and what he is done, Oidipoius blinds himself. Without conscious thought (he had a lot on his mind!) he has fulfilled the curse he earlier made on the killer he did not know was himself. No man of Thebes shall look upon the murderer’s face, he declared. Thus he puts out his own eyes, that he might never see himself in a mirror, a pool of water.
One of the stories about Teiresias, the sex changing, clearly points to esoteric practices, what I call alchemy. Supposedly a shepherd when young, Teiresias came across two snakes copulating. Some versions say he killed the female and became magically changed to a woman. Others, however, say that he thrust his shepherd’s staff—Tarotists might say his Wand—in between them, and was transformed.
A stick between two snakes forms the caduceus, the magic staff of Hermes, who uses it to guide dead souls on their journey (the association with the medical profession might be a mistake, for the healing wand of Aesclapious, founder of medicine, was a stick with one snake wound around it.
The caduceus forms an image of awakened kundalini, which yoga teachings describe as a snake at the bottom of the spine that uncoils as two streams wind around the spine until they reach the crown of the head where the energy opens into mystical light. The caduceus is pictured with wings at the top, and sometimes light.
Teiresias—or Teiresia, to use what would be the feminine version—lives seven years as a woman, seven being the number of the planetary spheres, and thus a complete cycle. Then, the myth tells us, she once again sees two snakes copulating and either repeats the trick with a staff, or once more kills one of them, the male this time, and again becomes a man.
All this can illustrate the deep mystery of kundalini, which is said to bring out the female in a man, the male in a woman (see also the famous Gospel of Thomas), producing a complete person, what the alchemists call The Crowned Hermaphrodite. The World card in the Tarot, symbol of perfection, is often associated with this figure.
A couple of years ago I had a chapbook of Tarot inspired poems published, Fortune’s Lover. The poem for The Lovers featured Teiresias and the caduceus. Here it is:
LOVERS
He was out walking with the sheep
when he saw the snakes,
two of them, copulating. He pushed his
staff, his Ace of Wands,
between them and became, briefly,
the Caduceus, a spine of light
entwined with serpents.
And when the human stepped back she’d
become a woman.
Seven years passed, as she traveled
through the seven planetary spheres,
the seven palaces supported on seven wise pillars.
Then she saw the snakes again,
the same pair or another, it makes no difference,
she moved her Cup between them,
and became—
not a man again, but something
more, beyond addition and subtraction,
a Knower, a Speaker,
blinded by Hera, sighted by Zeus,
Teiresias, whose name means
The One Who Delights In Signs.
The card of the Lovers—
a man on the right, a woman on the left,
and above and between them an angel
with outstretched arms and fiery hair—
together they are all Teiresas,
bright Caduceus in a single life.
A Praise Poem For Teiresias
Delighter in signs, ancestor,
you are always right.
You see beyond sight.
You see all the way through.
Delighter in signs, ancestor,
you read correctly.
Delighter in signs, ancestor,
You are always right.
Your body is snakes,
your face is wings.
your hair is plumage.
Delighter in signs, ancestor,
you question the owls,
they cannot refuse you.
Delighter of signs, ancestor,
you read correctly.
You know the secrets of men,
you know the secrets of women,
you know between and beyond,
above and below.
Delighter of signs, ancestor,
you taste the tongues of angels.
Delighter of signs, ancestor,
you are always right.
You open the door,
you see beyond windows.
You know all the meanings,
you know reversed and upright,
you know all the spreads.
Delighter of signs, ancestor,
you read correctly.
Rachel, your poem “The Lovers” is amazing. Thank you for sharing it with us again.
Nice poem. If Teresias is your muse, you must be a very good reader.
Wonderful poem, and wonderful reflections, Rachel!
Another story of Tiresias that I’ve found of some interest lately suggests that he was blinded (and given his oracular powers, if I’m not mistaken) in an Aktaion-like moment when he saw Athena bathing.
Which brings up a whole other set of questions: if Aktaion saw Artemis bathing and was torn apart by his own hounds for his trouble, and Tiresias was blinded and given oracular abilities by seeing Athena bathing…then, what would happen if someone saw Hestia–the other Greek virgin goddess–bathing? Hmm…
Hestia is a fire goddess. She doesn’t bathe.

So you can imagine how excited I was to be able to review the CEP Compression Shorts... especially because the major issues I had during my last marathon were with my quads. They seem to get a little temperamental when I torture them with hours upon hours of running... go figure. I used the shorts for recovery post-marathon. Just like the socks, there's definitely a technique to getting them on... I'll let you know when I figure it out. But I did eventually worm my way into them like the wicked step-sister trying to fit into Cinderella's shoe. I'd post a photo of myself in just the shorts, but I care about my readers too much. Can we just say compression + me = more muffin tops than a bakery on a Saturday morning? Ok then, we'll leave it at that. In all seriousness, though, once they were on, they were definitely compressive, but not uncomfortably so. I wore them for several hours each day for the couple of days following my marathon. I sincerely think they aided in recovery. My upper-legs were the most torn up by the Rock n Roll San Diego course... particularly my IT Bands and hamstrings, but also my quads. I can't say with 100% certainty if they sped up my improvement (especially since I did also have an appointment with my sports doc for A.R.T.) but they certainly made me feel more comfortable trapsing up and down the stairs post-marathon. Within 5 days post-marathon, I felt completely back to normal. Completely. It was almost odd considering that I felt sub-par for almost a month following my last marathon.
Nuu-Muu. And similar to the socks... they take a little getting used to, but I did notice that I had almost no soreness post run in the usual achy areas. It's hard to pinpoint exactly how much recovery and lack-of-soreness is due to compression-wear... but I *am* convinced that CEP is the best brand for compression gear in the market. And I can also say that after I started wearing compression gear, I have noticed a lot less soreness and a lot quicker recovery times (although other factors could contribute to this as well).

National Blood Service centralisation dispute
June 2, 2007 at 12:57 pm fleabite 1 comment.
The NBS in England currently has 13 regional centres which process and test donated blood before redistribution to the hospitals. However this vital service is under threat with management wanting to condense these regional centres into just 3 to cover the whole of England.
Unlike many NHS trusts, the NBS is not in debt, and operates efficiently with committed workers, many of whom have worked there for decades learning their highly specialised skills on the job.
Notes
- Currently processing centres are in : Oxford, Bristol, Southampton, Tooting, Colindale, Brentwood, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Cambridge, Sheffield and Leeds.
- The 3 proposed “supercentres” will be : Bristol, Manchester and Colindale.
- The National Blood Service role includes : collecting blood from donations from 100′s of sites daily, testing the blood for Hepatitis, HIV, Malaria and Syphilis, filtering the blood and separating into components. This must then be distributed promptly to hospitals.

Hi there
I’ve just finally registered as a poster to the site but being a bit of a dunce am not sure how to set up a new page for this dispute. So just for now I’ll have to use this comment section. (If anybody can move this to the front page for me it would be much appreciated!)
DEMONSTRATION
Lunchtime protests will be held at all blood centres in England on Friday 15th June. This is one day after International Donor Day (also the first day of a week of national leafleting in support of NBS workers by the UK IWW). Here are the addresses of affected centres for any available health activists who would like to go along + give the staff a boost.
Leeds Blood Centre, Bridle Path, Leeds, LS15 7TW
Colindale Blood Centre, Colindale Avenue, London, NW9 5BG

The continuity mistakes range from 007 star Daniel Craig's lace-up shoes changing to slip-ons during a train fight scene to a missing train stop during a journey on the London Underground.
Other grave errors, reported to website MovieMistakes.com, include a handbag disappearing after it is placed on the floor by Dame Judi Dench, and fluctuating levels of whiskey in a glass poured by Javier Bardem's villain Silva.
One picky contributor noted, ""There are mistakes in every film but some good ones in Skyfall.""
The blunders haven't hindered the film's success - Skyfall is the most lucrative instalment in the superspy franchise's history.

Rahima Foundation encourages the community to generously donate used cars in working condition that are no longer needed. There are many families in our local areas that desperately need a car, but cannot afford to buy one. A car can make a huge difference in their lives, such as helping them to get a much needed job, or allowing them to provide transportation for their children to and from school. Having their own transportation will be very helpful for these families to stand on their own.
Unlike some other organizations, we actually give the car to a deserving family, rather than sell it for what it’s worth. This is the reason we require that the car be in good working condition and should have passed the smog test. We will take care of all the DMV paperwork, and you will get the satisfaction of helping someone in need, and the benefit of a tax deduction for the fair value of the car.
Please consider donating your used car to someone in need.

Topic: Adding nested form elements within a <tr> block
Hi, I'm developing a Rails 3.2 app using Cocoon to handle a deeply nested form.
My grandchild elements consist of a text field and series of check boxes. I'd like to render these within a table, each row being a new record.
I am having difficulty setting up Cocoon to append new records, contained within a <tr> block, to the table.
I originally tried doing this with Ryan Bates nested_forms, but switched to Cocoon as it appeared to offer more control over element placement. But still no joy.
Has anyone else successfully rendered nested form elements within a table? If so, what approach did you use?
Thanks for your time.

Take the above for instance. This one was issued by Major General Edmund Kirby Smith in attempt to recruit Kentuckians to join the Confederate army when they invaded the state in 1862. It was apparently tacked to a tree in Harrison County. It clearly makes an effort to use native Kentuckians and Confederate commanders John C. Breckinridge and Simon Bolivar Buckner as a means of appeal to the men of the state. The bill also explains that Kentucky's and the Confederacy's interests are one.
It says:
"Kentuckians, I am authorized by the President of the Confederacy to organize troops and issue commissions. I appeal to you to make one effort for your principles, for your institutions [slavery] and for your state. Rally under your flag, organize and muster your men in the cause of the South. Breckenridge [sic], Buckner and their brave Kentuckians are on their way to join you. Make one effort, strike one blow and your state will be saved, from Yankee thraldom [sic] and take place in the van of the Confederacy, where her interests, her institutions and her principles rightfully place her.
Kirby Smith, Major Gen. C.S.A."

This is one of my favorites -- I like how some of the pieces of type were (hastily?) put into place upside-down in several words in the bottom paragraph ("from," "Yankee," "institution," etc). Have you done much reading on printing during the Civil War?
Yeah, it's a cool document. I haven't read much about printing in the Civil War, but I'm sure that the process of setting type (usually backward) so that it comes out correctly was a talent that came through experience. I have found many typos from setting type in period newspapers.

I had to ask how it all came about. Here's Lauren:
"Before I was writing full-time, I worked as an Associate Editor at HarperCollins Children's Books, so I got to spend a lot of time with the art department there and I realized a) how bad I was at visualizing cover concepts that represented and helped promote books, and b) how absolutely excellent the art department was at doing just that. Writing a story and visually representing the story are really very, very separate skills. In my experience, even when authors come into a project with a clear idea for the cover, they often end up groveling at the feet of the talented designers and artists who can get at their books in a really different way and bring something entirely new and fresh to the package of the book.
"This is all to say that it did not even occur to me to try and visualize what the Fallen cover would look like. I left that in the hands of the experts from the beginning! And that was a very good idea...
Read the rest of Lauren's Cover Story. It only gets better!

Heart of the Demon
By Cynthia Garner
Release Date: February 26, 2013
Source: Publisher
. . .
Every generation, preternaturals come to Earth through a rift that connects the worlds for a short period of time, where supernatural creatures come through and take over the bodies of humans. This time, though, a group of rogues want to keep the rift open longer with a new machine they built, hoping to gain enough preternaturals to take over the human race. The Council of Preternaturals isn't too happy about this, and blackmails fey Kiera O'Brien into infiltrating the rogue group and shutting it down. Little does she know that Finn, a Demon she's started falling for, has also been asked to infiltrate the group in order to earn his freedom from Lucifer. Can they find the machine and stop the operation before the rift opens?
Hmmm where to start? There were so many levels to this book and I completely fell in love with them all. First, you have Kiera and Finn, both broken and not sure if they can really love someone for the rest of their lives. Then, you have the fact that neither of them know their both on the same side, so they have to deal with their trust issues from constantly lying to each other. Lastly, you have the whole bad guy with the machine who wants to create an apocalyptic attack on Earth. Kiera and Finn definitely have their work cut out for them.
I really loved both Kiera and Finn's characters and how they both had serious trust issues. Getting the story from both of their sides was a really great part of the book because you really got to connect with both characters. I also really liked how many different supernatural beings there were because it made the book so much more entertaining.
Overall, this was a great paranormal romance that had some action and mystery thrown in to keep things interesting. If you haven't read a Cynthia Garner book yet, I'd definitely recommend you do! Especially if you're a paranormal romance lover who has a soft spot for the not so normal, yet incredibly irresistible paranormal creatures.
Seems like a good book! :) LOVE the cover!

At the company's media summit in San Francisco this morning, Bass told a crowd of journalists, analysts and customers gathered in the company's slick design gallery (see pictures below) that the combination of mobile devices, cloud computing and social collaboration is more profound than the shift to PCs.
Bass sees the world changing from a PC-centric model where workers promise to "email you that file when I get back to the office," to an environment where mobile devices and the cloud make where ever you are the computing center of the world.
It's already happening, he claimed, citing a list of impressive usage figures:
- 2 million unique visitors a month to Autodesk 360, the company's cloud offering
- 30 files a minute uploaded to AutoCAD WS, the company's cloud-based AutoCAD editor
- 10 million downloads of SketchBook in 2 years, now averaging 150,000 per week on PC and mobile platforms
- 13 million unique visitors - more than Pinterest - to the company's Instructables community
- 21 million unique visitors a month to Pixlr, its online photo editor
On the low end, naysayers like to denigrate the importance of mobile products, Bass said, calling them "juvenile" "toys." But he pointed out that "consumers by night are often professionals by day."
He also claimed that professionals can do serious work on today's portable devices. "I think we're underestimating these small devices... in the work that we do. They can run serious apps" for engineers and other demanding users, and they are getting more powerful all the time.
Meanwhile, on the high end, the cloud lets anyone take advantage of analyses that used to require dedicating expensive workstations for days at a time. Now, "You can do it in the cloud in an hour," he said.
The cloud, Bass added, "is an infinitely scalable resource," limited only by how much you're willing to pay. For urgent jobs, you can pay more and get it done faster. Other tasks can be done more cheaply over time. And that raises a fundamental question: "What would you do differently if you could compute answers faster?"
Autodesk may be a bit ahead of its time. The vast majority of serious design work is still being done sitting at powerful workstations, just as it has been for a while. But Bass couldn't be more correct about the trends. It's hard to argue that more and more computing tasks are going to stop moving away from the desktop. Big, data intensive jobs will move to the cloud while smaller, more UI-focused tasks are going mobile.
There will always be some things best done sitting at your computer. But the number of those things is clearly shrinking, not growing.
Tomorrow, I'll write about Autodesk's cloud-based PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) offering. But in the meantime, enjoy a couple more shots of some of the cool designs on display in the Autodesk Gallery:

"...Mister Keough served as the best man at LMP's nuptials to her current husband. That children, is so damn civilized and modern that we just can't stand it."
Always a hoot, Mama! But then I'm no stranger to familial shenanigans either since my dear BGD's fourth marriage was to his second cousin shortly before our 15th anniversary (hand to God, chillrun).
=8-O
Considering the microscope the somewhat reclusive spawn of Elvis grew up under, it seems to me that despite four marriages, she turned out NOT to be a flaming white hot mess (leaving out her brief foray into insanity as the "wife" of the dearly departed White Lady.)
Architecturally insignificant and uninspired, I am nonetheless still somewhat surprised at this teardown. Even in a good economy a $5MM demolition in Hot-As-Hell Hidden Hills can still raise my eyebrows (despite the botox) ––– even the most bottomless-pocketed pre-pubescent billionaire's daughter cannot be that obsessed with the equestrian lifestyle ––– there's gotta be more to this backstory.
The proximity to the storied Ahmanson Ranch cannot explain (even if there's a Gwathmey+Siegel tour-de-force masterpiece in the wings) is simply not enough to justify a multi-million dollar teardown.
Actually it is no longer Coes Hill but rather a redoing of the older house. Here is the description:
"Former farmhouse, now house, of late C16 and early C17 date, probably re-roofed in the C18. Restored and refenestrated in the 1990s. The attached 1990s structures to the north west and early C21 extension to the east are not of special interest."
You can see an aerial view on Google Earth. The place seems very spread out, by no means a great country house, but it does have a tennis court. I didn't see anything that looked like a swimming pool, but perhaps it is under a roof of some sort.
Lisa Marie seems quite a piece of work. Her Wiki bio indicates no schooling at all, certainly no university. Heiress to the Presley fortune most of which she sold off in 2005. Married to Michael Jackson and Nic Cage, the latter marriage taking longer to dissolve than did the marriage itself (108 days). Has done good works, evidently, not a bad person, but a seemingly chaotic life. One hopes she has been happy in contrast to her father.
Well, I mean, does someone know what prime land (and I'm presuming this was prime) goes for in Hidden Hills?
Maybe, even with the structures, this wasn't that far off the mark.
But more interestingly, I thought Lisa Marie was the sole heir to the Presley fortune. Doesn't she have huge cash flow from all the various Elvis generators? Why would she be living in a house that was expendable?
Have to say in interviews she comes off as quite odd. No, or low affect, as they say -- at least for public consumption. If she has charm, then it's directed elsewhere.
Probably nothing to it, but I see Lisa's homes looking much like Graceland. Maybe this is why the buyers thought they needed to just tear everything down and start all over.
If only I could've been a fly on the wall during her marriage to the Gloved One. What a hoot those two must've been.
Can you imagine them sitting around the breakfast table, MJ all Propofol-ed up and Lisa sucking down a double wide G&T?

What real-estate agents won't tell you
Fair-housing laws prevent agents from talking about neighborhood demographics, and they often don't want to discuss other details, such as crime stats. Luckily, the Web picks up where agents leave off.
immediate past-estate questions,'s Quick Facts page breaks down the information easily, by city and county.
"That would also show general socioeconomic.
Yes I do appreciate your point of view. You have mentioned good points & one should always keep in mind while purchasing house. In my case when my retired parents was looking for retirement community. We ensured all the points then we found garden spot village is the perfect place for them & it is one of the Best Retirement Communities Lancaster PA.
This column is absolute garbage. Open houses are done to expose this property to potential buyers even though most hokes are sold by agents taking clients on tour. If a buyer tells me that he/she is willing to pay more than the written offer I am NOT allowed to disclose that. (same if sellers tell me they'll sell for less than listed). Most Realtors are hard working, honest and committed to help the client (buyer or seller), but like any other profession ther are some rotten apples in the mix.

What: A ten-week challenge for real people to go back to real food, real simply. We're going to try to eat WHOLE foods (not the grocery store) that have been altered as little as possible from farm to table. We'll learn about and practice ways of preparing foods that our ancestors did instinctively, and science now supports. And we will try to do this as simply as possible.
I will be posting information, recipes, and encouragement each week, according to the ten food guidelines in the previous post. People will be challenged to follow one guideline a week, building on them, until all ten are being followed during the last week. There is much grace in this. Some guidelines may be harder, or impossible, to follow, so you can customize this as you wish.
When: The challenge last ten-weeks, and will start January 12th and last until March 22nd. Ideally, you will take some of these changes and make them LIFESTYLE changes though.
Where: All around the world! I'm hoping to have weekly or biweekly recipe demonstrations in the Boston/Newton area, but I'm willing to travel if there is interest.
Why: If you check out my welcome, you'll see that both my husband and I have experienced some health issues that modern medicine just wasn't able to "fix." Food was one of the ways we restored our health, so I'm pretty passionate about sharing my experience and knowledge with others. Our health is invaluable, and we often live sub-par physical lives, assuming the way we feel is just "part of getting older." That doesn't have to be true. Let's take back our health, and take back our food!
Taking the health interest survey would be really helpful to me. And please post a comment if you're in!
Hi Megan. Cool info so far.

Predict the Next Name: Bess Myerson, Sun-Yi Previn, Winona Ryder, Rex Reed...
The answer, of course, is disgraced Bush adviser Claude Allen, who has now joined the ranks of celebrity shoplifters by trying to boost $5,000 in stylish-yet-budget-priced goods from a Maryland Target store.
Recall when Soon Yi Previn Allen was so unknown she was only called one of "Mia Farrow's daughters" here.
Relive how Winona Ryder stole America's innocence, along with fancy clothes, here.
And thrill to Rex Reed's greatest performance outside of the titular-less role star turn in Myra Breckenridge, here.
Evil Twin Update: As reader digamma notes below, some folks are claiming that the dastardly deed was done not by Claude but by his lawbreaking twin brother Floyd. For details,.
Some people are saying the perpetrator was Allen's twin brother. Really.
Life imitates Arrested Development.
Wow. This raises the interesting question: Why is "Lloyd" spelled with two "L"s but "Floyd" only spelled with one? It also brings to mind Drew Barrymore's finest role.
Allen missed out on a diplomatic opportunity. He could have won over the Dems by ripping off Walmart instead of Target.
Baylen-
If Lloyd is spelled with two L's then Floyd should be spelled with two F's.
"Ffloyd." I like that. It's seriously ffucked-up.
It's delightful. The evil twin controversy will keep this all over TV for months and months...the WH will find it impossible to bury it. They can intimidate the Times and buy off the "serious" journalists, but once tabloid TV gets hold of a story no power on Earth can stop the juggernaut of coverage.
From what I can divine so far, I think the evil twin may have started the scam and pulled his brother into it.
Even more ffreaky, "Floyd" is already a misspelling of Welsh "Lloyd". But there's nothing too strange about "Ffloyd" - many Welsh words begin with "ff".
and now for something completely different,
Psychologists have formally recognized John Henryism as a style of strong coping behaviors used by many African Americans to deal with psychosocial and environmental stressors such as career issues, health problems and even racism.
The researchers quantify John Henryism using a questionnaire that reveals a 'single-minded' drive to succeed, even beyond a person's overall self-interest, which is the hallmark of JH,
One brother posing as another when in trouble happens. I knew two guys who did it (and neither was a twin).
Winona Ryder is, or at least has been, too much like the government, but she's also quite hot.
It will be terrible for him.
Prosecutors will not allow him to plead out with misdemeanors and will press 4 felony charges against him. They will campaign against Claude for months to print in the minds of the public he should be jailed for a few years and pay detectives and defamers and give a few phone calls to destroy his image and reputation even more. They will stage an exhibition of the stolen goods (with holes in them?) and demand the trial be televised. And if contrary to their plans the jury acquits him on one or two charges, they'll stage a press conference to explain that jailtime never was at stake, which will enrage the public even more.
I feel awfully sorry for him, it seems clear that his methods show there was no intent, no evil mind, and he was terribly depressed and vulnerable and had a substance problem. Meds can alter your judgement to the point you're not even thinking.
er er hold on, am I getting mixed up with another story?

At Least Her Avatar Doesn't Smoke
Anti-smoking activist Stanton Glantz thought Avatar was "a great movie," except for the one detail that moved him to launch a publicity campaign against it: Grace Augustine, the environmental scientist played by Sigourney Weaver, has a cigarette habit. "This is like someone just put a bunch of plutonium in the water supply," Glantz tells The New York Times, with his usual sense of proportion. In addition to rousing the ire of Glantz's Smoke Free Movies project, Avatar, which is rated PG-13, earned a "black lung" from Scenesmoking.org. In response, director James Cameron says he considers smoking "a filthy habit" and does not view Weaver's character as "an aspirational role model" for teenagers:.
Cameron is a bit too defensive, I think, but he is right to reject the notion that art should not only be didactic but that it should impart the lessons endorsed by the reigning ideology—in this case, "public health," which elevates the minimization of morbidity and mortality above all other values. The expectation that everyone who is not in the pocket of Big Tobacco will toe the official line is one of the creepiest aspects of the contemporary anti-smoking movement, as exemplified by Glantz.
I criticized the campaign for smoke-free movies in a 2003 column and discussed Glantz's wild claims about the impact of cinematic smoking in a 2005 column. Last month Peter Suderman raised some non-tobacco-related objections to.
Anti-smoking activist Stanton Glantz thought Avatar was "a great movie," except for the one detail that moved him to launch a publicity campaign against it: Grace Augustine, the environmental scientist played by Sigourney Weaver, has a cigarette habit.
Ok, so the movie contained all the leftist cliches possible except vegetarianism AND antismoking.
Well, two out of 1,000 ain't bad.
LOL: James Cameron’s Avatar is Disney’s Pochontas:
Pocahontas is way better as it does not end happily ever after.
It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie. It's only a movie.
Exactly, as long as you enjoy it that's all that matters. For me it was fun.
Yep. Piss-poor story and characters, little more than "Indians in Space." But one helluva spectacular ride.
Has anyone suggested yet to Stanton Glantz to go stick his head up his ass?
Like telling the Pope to turn Catholic, JW.
everyone who is not in the pocket of Big Tobacco will toe the official line
This phrase seems familiar to me, but not quite right somehow...
Actually, meine Dame, "toe the line" is the correct spelling of that idiom. It's not "tow the line," if that's what you were thinking.
It's actually "tow the lion".
No dude, it's "tow the lion".
Jinx!
Roar, someone called?
+1.
I like that toe the line becomes Tow the Lion as in pull a large hairy beast which now becomes a large hairy beast named Tow.
Whoa, thanks for explaining that difficult concept!
Buy me a coke?
"Tao the lime"...you mean I've been saying it wrong all these years?
Yeah, I was referring to the 2008(?) H&R meme.
Soon it will be objectionable for anyone in the movies or TV to eat fatty foods. "Man vs. Food" beware!
God, I wish that was far-fetched.
We live in a time in which satire has become impossible.
Why stop there?
The use of fat actors should be banned.
After all, they didn't get fat from exercising.
I look forward to the re-re-re-release of Avatar, where the cigarettes will be replaced by walkie-talkies. And the entire cast will be replaced by Wookies.
No ewoks? Bummer.
Chris Dodd (D-Wall Street Banksters) is not running for re-election this year, he has announced. Unfortunately, that might make it more difficult for Peter Schiff to win the general election, should he take the Republican primary.
Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, says he will run on the Democratic ticket, and being that Connecticut votes heavily Democratic, it will be tough for Peter. Furthermore, the only Republicans that have come from Connecticut in the past few decades have been hardcore statists, which means that there is almost no constituency for liberty in that state. I wish Peter the best, but the hill has become a bit more steep for him.
There's already a thread about that.
In addition to rousing the ire of Glantz's Smoke Free Movies project, Avatar, which is rated PG-13, earned a "black lung" from smokesense.org.
If the coal miners from the 1940s were alive to read that, they'd be rolling in their graves.
They'd clawing at the lids to their coffins.
There was mining in the movie, too. Well, potential mining at least.
To respond with anything more hedged than "See this ass, bitches? Eat it," is to "endorse the reigning ideology" that a world of official concerns and issues, minutely and endlessly addressed, at all times, in all things, by all, always, is what constitutes society.
My comment upon seeing the movie was that it was like StarCraft invaded a fantasy role-playing MMPORG.
The human evil-space-militarists were obviously just as much their own kind of fantasy universe as the Pandorans.
They just came from a different combat commando FPS universe than a MMPORG.
The whole gainan enviro-freak thing is not serious at all. It's the story line to a video game. The real meaning of the film is about losing yourself in alternate realities created by fantasy gaming.
They're fucking flying dragons for fuck sake, people. That's a dead giveaway.
Also, aren't the Na'vi a little too much like night elves?
yeah, they are very night-elfish. But there aren't any Orcs or Mideaval humans involved, so I couldn't say it was WarCraft III.
I should add... Weaver smokes because that's just what the characters in combat-commando-scifi computer games DO. They aren't futuristic Americans, they're the Terrans from StarCraft. Or rather, they are futuristic Americans as envisioned by combat FPS video games of the past decade.
But apparently the "Americans" in the film are complete psychotic morons. And the film pretty much revels in their grizzly deaths. The whole thing looks like a liberal revenge fantasy against the evil military industrial complex.
Snuffatar
Dude, that's because the Terrans in StarCraft, and pretty much every other futuristic combat commando game are complete psychotic morons.
You're entirely missing my point. They are portrayed that way because they are video game characters lifted out of the whole sci-fi combat FPS genre. That's the style.
That is a crazy premise to make a movie. The chances of any individual unit in starcraft surviving the scenario is just above zero kelvin. They are just mindless cannon fodder. Fun to send out to kill shit with, but not too interesting to watch on screen.
And yet the film has made over a billion dollars already. Granted, these are 2009/2010 dollars, so that's really like forty bucks. But that's still not bad.
Is that world wide? It has made 367 in the US. It is not surprising it is doing well overseas. Simple dialog, big graphics, and is basically a US soldier snuff film.
I'm really surprised Blizzard hasn't sued Cameron for ripping them off.
It's obvious that Avatar is space marines vs. night elves.
Blizzard has to be careful, otherwise Games Workshop will sue them for stealing the Space Marines in the 1st place.
And the heinlein estate will sue them for stealing the powered body armor idea from Starship Troopers.
I don't know that it's fair to paint Starcraft with the same message brush as Elves in Space.
Yeah, the Terrans are rednecks, and yeah the Space Marines are often technologically "rehabilitated" lunatics and criminals. But it was the Protoss who started the game off by eradicating whole Terran colonies -- not for crimes against the environment or imperialism or whatever; just because there were Zerg on their planets. If there's a message about the evil of "collateral damage" thinking, then it's the wise benevolent aliens that are the villains, not the Space Hicks. (Not to mention the wise benevolent aliens live in a caste-based society and are governed by a rigid, dogmatic quasi-theocratic ideology).
The Terran campaign starts out as a revolution against a despotic government, but ends with the leader of the revolution betraying his close friends, allying with opportunistic members of the despotic government, seizing absolute power and implementing something even worse than what came before. The Terran campaign's message is about the dark side of hope and change.
The "good guys" in the Protoss campaign, meanwhile, are really the Dark Templars and the Protoss that end up trying to reconcile with them. The Dark Templars were expelled from Protoss society because they rejected the new teachings for fear they would lose their individuality.
The antagonistic humans in the expansion are basically a libertarian's dystopian view of the future UN -- from starcraft.wikia.com:
"The United Powers League... succeeded the defunct United Nations and took on the mantle as the defender of humanity... The UPL sought to enforce conformity in the name of "enlightened socialism". Fascist tactics destroyed ethnic separation and racism. English was imposed as the primary language while other languages were banned. Unitariate Commissions began banning religions in 2231[2] and religion fell under an official ban... While not a religious organization, the UPL embraced the philosophy of "the divinity of mankind", scholars arguing that genetic alteration, cyber technology and the use of psychoactive drugs led to the degeneration of the human species... which led to launch of Project Purification... a campaign of mass genocide in which over 400 million people were eradicated."
Does the evil of the UPL (later UED) sound more like jingoistic hicks, or Progressive Intellectuals with Big Ideas about the Greater Good?
Fact is, the Space Marines are the least of three evils -- Raynor is essentially the everyman hero whose changing alliances (from colonist to revolution to Tassadar's Protoss to Zeratul's dark templars) are supposed to indicate the current "good guys". And the good guys are usually good because they're honorable and individualist in their ethics. Hell, even Kerrigan is a magnificent bastard(ess) because of her vaguely Byronic personality. The bad guys, the hive-mind Zerg, the dogmatic Enclave, the eugenic UED, the despotic Confederacy and Terran Dominion, are all hierarchical, strongly governed, and/or collectivist entities (the irony of the player essentially being an ur-dictator in all campaigns notwithstanding).
Starcraft is about as close to a libertarian message game as we can get (no, Bioshock doesn't count).
Hey, all I was trying to say is that the behavior of the humans in Avatar are representative of sci-fi space militarists in all sorts of other video games of the past decade. StarCraft being the most obvious. Powered body armor included.
Considering that most Americans (and probably an even greater percentage of international moviegoers) have never heard of StarCraft, I don't think that's the intended message, or the one that will be received.
Korea on the other hand....
Okay, well pick scifi combat commando game of choice. Halo 3 maybe?
An unfortunate collision of high fantasy tropes and Space Marines sounds more like Warhammer 40k (although technically Starcraft ripped off Warhammer, so...)
Can we get a Spoiler Alert here? Now I'm totally not going to be surprised when I see Weaver light one up.
Its a sled.
Cameron is no hack like Welles. I saw that coming a mile away.
Its a sled.
Neatly executed. It took me several seconds to get that.
Cute.
Seriously, there shouldn't be spoiler alerts for Avatar.
Nothing in there will surprise you. Nothing. But it will delight the hell out of the kid in you.
Let me out! Let me out!
/muffled screams.
I hate the kid in me. He was gristly.
He was unpleasant to eat? I'm willing to believe that.
That was your pancreas, Sug. :::shakes head:::
When I was a kid I would have rooted for the stupid little blue bastards to be killed. I doubt Avatar will make the kid in my smile.
Your last name is McCain, isn't it?
Reminds me of my childhood reaction to Smurfs. Maybe I wasn't typical though -- I did bite off my sister's stuffed bunny's ears after watching Watership Down.
Oh John, they blow lots and lots of things up. Things go boom!
Filthy Critic gave the review that's keeping me out of the theater: "I heart Ferngully"
I never saw Ferngully as a kid, and I'm not interested now.
I had to watch fern gully in elemetary school... it was part of me Massachusetts progressive education along with the late 80s -early 90's experiement with "whole language."
Looking back on elementary school i now realize how much of it was green propeganda from Earth Day being mad ea big event to science class being dominated by the water cycle and polution to "diversity" being taught as a virtue (keep in mind diversity only applied to the color of your skin not diversity of though or the individual)
In retrospect, my late 80s-early 90s elementary education was definitely all about environmental responsibility. Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle was our pledge of allegiance.
Is that like Stop, Drop, and Roll?
What I got out of FernGully: a new word "bodacious" and weirdly thinking Tim Curry as black goo was somehow sexy.
Snape kills Dumbledore
Yay!
"which again is a negative comment about people in our real world living too much in their avatars, meaning online and in video games...."
But the main character, the good guy, becomes an avatar forever. How is that a "negative comment" on living too much as an avatar? Cameron is obviously backtracking here, all for the sake of seeming PC about smoking. Fuck Glantz, fuck Cameron, fuck PC Hollywood.
Yes, that's interesting.
I think cameron is being a bit toungue-in-cheek about it.
But you know the main character is a guy in a hweelchair paralyzed, who is able to walk again through his avatar.
I don't think it's possible to be tongue-in-cheek about a movie that is an amalgamation of just about every crowd-pleasing blockbuster ever made.
Another reason why this movie is retarded: They have technology advanced enough to send people light years through space to live through avatars but they can even treat paralysis with anything more than a wheelchair?
They had a treatment but it was too expensive. Apparently, Obamacare never got through.
Because of capitalism and corporations of course.
No heller it is BECAUSE Obamacare got through... you know the rationing and death panels were in effect.
Ummm no, in the Avatar universe there would be no Obamacare because humanity is taken over by evil capitalism. Only unobtainium stolen from the peaceful natives can pay for his expensive medical operation back home on Earth(tm).
"Fuck Glantz"
That's glans.
Thanks for the coerrection.
And none of the bad guys had avatars, either. Cameron is definitely backtracking, but it's probably due more to the criticism of Avatar as a thinly-veiled leftist screed than to the smoking concerns.
But the main character, the good guy, becomes an avatar forever.
Wow, there's no way I would have guessed that twist ending from the random portions of the trailer that I've seen. The movie is ruined for me now.
Good. I just saved you $18-$10, a few hours, and a headache from watching 3D stuff fly at you. Also, I saved you from watching a movie you've already see before, except in little bits and pieces of other, orginal movies.
Yeah, he's not technically an avatar at the end -- he's fully Na'vi, with no machine intermediaries between his human body and his Na'vi body.
Though I'm wondering about several things related to that [SPOILERS AHEAD!]...how did the Na'vi know how to transfer the spirit from a human body into a Na'vi avatar body, when avatars were unknown to them until the humans came (and given their relations with humans, it's doubtful they would have wanted to do this before).
Also, how are the humans who were permitted to stay on Pandora going to keep supplied with human-edible food and oxygen, which the Na'vi do not have the technology to produce?
::cracks knuckles::
Well, Tulpa, the Tree of Life, as with every other living thing on the planet of Pandora, is connected through electric impulses. From my primitive understanding of casting human brains into avatar bodies, I believe the electric signals of the brain constitute that brain (and therefore the personhood of the human-avatar in question). That packet of electric signals must be constantly sent to the avatar in order to keep the connection going. When hotTerminatorGuy is at the Tree of Life (the nerve center of all electric signals, I presume), it's tendrils (also full of electric impulses) fully captured the electric brain fully and imprinted it into the Na'vi body.
/BS
I don’t believe in the dogmatic idea that no one in a movie should smoke. Movies should reflect reality.
Spoken without even a hint of irony.
REFLECT reality. Like the image of the sky in an oil streaked puddle.
Movies should reflect the reality of blue-skinned aliens on beautiful, Gaia-esque planets.
I find it somewhat amusing that a movie that contains some of the most obvious racist colonial trope as this movie is liked at all by the left. I guess the enviornmental message dwarfs the fact that the blue kitties are completely lost without the help of one good white male. Oh and the smoking is bad too I guess.
Personally I think its a movie with neat effects and a juvenile story line. Which is good enough for entertainment I enjoyed my time in the theater. However, the left love to look "deeper" into these things, so its kind of fun to not see them look deeper to the obvious problem with this film.
"the blue kitties are completely lost without the help of one good white male."
That is pretty much how lefties see the world and minorities in particular.
Yeah, I noticed that too. The one white male hero arrives to save the day, flying the biggest fucking dragon of all, thereby fulfilling tribal prophecy. Whereupon he is worshipped practically as a God.
People, this is *exactly* the narrative of a fantasy role playing game. It's so entirely superficial I can't see how anyone takes it seriously, in either a positive or negative way.
That is a good point. And pretty pathetic statement about the movie. Video games can get away with lame or ridiculous plots because you are playing them as opposed to watching them. A movie with a video game plot is pretty low.
The movie is called 'Avatar' for a reason.
Because it's about video games.
The main character displaces his personality into an alternate body in a fantasy universe.
They fly dragons and ride dinosaurs.
The humans have giant steel powered body armor suits and fly space ships.
Like I said, it's as if StarCraft invaded the Night Elves home town. Or some equivalent fantasy RPG universe.
It is even lame for the video game. No one would play a video game like that and chose to play the blue things. You would play the humans and slaughter the blue things.
What? The blue things get to fly dragons and mind-meld with a tree.
That sounds like WAY more fun.
To each his own, but I would rather hunt varmints.
That's not a fair characterization. [SPOILERS AHEAD!] The "blue kitties" saved the white male's life the first night in the forest, and only after they had taught him their peace-loving, harmonious-with-nature ways was he able to find the inner strength to fight against the eeeeevil humans. A blue one also saved him at the end.
yeah, but it's still about the white mans mental journey.
The blue kitties are never expected to expand their minds and learn to understand the ways and culture of the white people. they are assumed to be too primitive to grasp the concept that the other side might have something of value to teach them too.
Another reason why Pocahontas is the better movie, even though the two are similar. The actual member of the native tribe saves the day.
I think there's a valid concern here. Children watching Avatar in 3D are going to see Ripley seemingly puffing on a cig right next to them in the theater. And we all know that virtual secondhand smoke is exactly as dangerous as the real thing.
Win
And we all know that virtual secondhand smoke is exactly as dangerous as the real thing.
Actually this is true.
"I find it somewhat amusing that a movie that contains some of the most obvious racist colonial trope as this movie is liked at all by the left."
The soft speakers on NPR this morning called it the most derivative unoriginal movie they had ever seen, and warned that it didn't really say or mean anything.
When you make a liberal revenge fantasy and have lost NPR.
When you make a liberal revenge fantasy and have lost NPR.
Posted twice, but still a sentence fragment.
That's just because they havn't played enough video games to recognize it as one of them.
I think we've all got your point about video games by now Hazel. Really.
What I don't get is how Cameron could have spent 15 years of his life trying to get such an obviously unoriginal and stupid movie made. This movie looks like something the studios threw together with six different screen writers in a few months and then foisted on the public not a fifteen year labor of love by an allegedly serious director.
C'mon. I know its not Shakespheare but cut us some slack.
I don't think it was the script that took 15 years -- it was piecing together the visuals and the equipment necessary to put them on screen.
True enough. But you would think at some point during those 15 years Cameron would have tried to fix a few of the holes in the plot.
Mothers are always the last to see the flaws in their children.
He only added the plot because the executives kept bitching. The first draft of the movie was called "Three Hours of Fucking Awesome CGI Special Effects in Space (in 3D!!!)". It just so happened that Pocahontas was the last thing he had watched, so...
It was Dances with Smurfs, in 3-D.
Pocahantas Dances with Smurfs, in 3D
Glantz's textbook is pretty good. He seems to be pretty much a wanker though. Très bay area.
It should be noted that there was MUCH more to the movie, but it was cut to fit the time alloted.
It should be noted that there was MUCH more to the movie, but it was cut so that future DVD releases can be used to milk the "director's cut" market. Fixed it for you.
Oh is that it? I guess all the morally complex, interesting and unique angels to the story took too long to develop so there was only enough time for the simple, trite, and predictable stuff.
I think you give Cameron too much credit. If there were interesting and unique angles to the story, why not put them in in the first place?
sarcasm
John's head
In his defense, I meant my sarcastic response to be to Kroneborge's post, not John's reply to Kroneborge's post, but somehow I got hit the wrong one which made it kind of confusing. Damn threaded comments!
How would you know this?
Read about it in a Cameron interview. He said when he first wrote the script it was basically a novel, and he had to cut it down to get it to an acceptable movie length.
One wonders why he didn't go the trilogy route then. Of course, it's quite possible that the stuff that got cut was just as trite and worthless as the stuff that made it into the film.
"If it’s O.K. for people to lie, cheat, steal and kill in PG-13 movies, why impose an inconsistent morality when it comes to smoking?"
Ugh. I understand what he's saying, but I hate the implication that smoking is immoral. Just because something's unhealthy doesn't mean it's "wrong," per se.
It happened when the definition of immoral became "things I don't like."
Hey, I like that definition. It makes the left and most government actions immoral.
Of course, I can usually give a more reasoned explanation than "I don't like it".
"This is like someone just put a bunch of plutonium in the water supply," Glantz tells The New York Times
cowabunga, dude!
Cameron's fifteen years was taken up mostly by a) playing, and b) inventing and developing new technology & techniques to allow him to even get his (lame) story to the screen at all. I definitely agree that the film's story is wonky, but it is the most astoundingly beautiful film I've ever seen - and the absolute best motion stereography I've seen.
Hiro Protagonist is not amused.
Another story full of leftist tripe. But less enjoyable.
People always have wondered what kind of movie Ed Wood would have made if he had been given infinite resources. Well, now we know.
Except Ed Wood's version would have given Jake Sully a female avatar.
Wearing a pink angora sweater.
For me there is a disconnect between population control nuts also being smoking nazis. The anti-tobacco hype offered by liars like Henry Waxman has just about driven me to the point of believing cigarettes must actually be good for you.
Yes. And the anti-smoking ads before movies make me wish I was cool enough to smoke.
Fe'ces.
LOL: James Cameron’s Avatar is Disney’s Pochontas:
Too funny!
Sigourney smoking was one of the few plot elements I give Cameron props for. Takes balls these days to make protagonists smokers in movies.
As far as everything else, I wish egotistical directors like Cameron and Lucas would focus on their groundbreaking technology and let actual writers do the writing.
But I agree with A.G. Pym above. The plot was kind of beside the point.
Which is why the movie will be forgotten in a matter of months. The technology will progress and become more widely used and Avatar won't look so spectacular to future movie goers. It will just be a cheap looking movie with a dumb plot. Seriously, who watches Who Framed Roger Rabbit or The Abyss anymore?
I disagree. I think Avatar is more groundbreaking like the Matrix (though not quite as good). I think it will change the way movies are made for a long time.
Plus, I just enjoyed it. Predicatable story, sure. But that means my head won't hurt from knew thoughts, lol
Certainly the Matrix proves you don't have to have a coherent plot to be influential.
Hey, the Matrix was coherent. Very Nietzscheian.
Plus it gave me hope that the real world wasn't actually run by liberals, but by human-harvesting machines.
The difference being? Actually, I would call the Republicans human-harvesting machines. There was a meeting of them here a month ago and all the couples wanted separate beds (NO JOKE).
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit or The Abyss anymore?"
Tony.
Sigourney smoking was one of the few plot elements I give Cameron props for.
Character element not plot element. If her smoking was a plot element she would have used a zipo to kill an enemy or stuck a lit cigarette in a someone eye or she would have gotten cancer...anyway you get the idea.
Bitter babes who smoke, gotta love em
Seriously, where did I come from? Kinda snuck up on everybody, yeah? And vomited.
Yeah, Cameron could've just put me at the end. Nobody would've noticed.
I would've been awesome for the final battle scene!
Once again...Avatar is not a left wing movie with left wing themes.
Wrong. It is anti-capitalism, anti-corporations, anti-war, and environmentalist. Any left wing themes missing?
Just vegetarianism - oh, and (getting back to the article) anti-smoking zealotry.
Queers.
Wrong it is pro property rights pro free labor markets and pro liberty and pro religion informed morality and pro gun rights and pro local government.
plus we got the smoking example.
You need to stop reading the nut jobs at "Big Hollywood" without a critical eye.
oh yeah the story of the ex-marine is very pro-individual.
Also the sexual liberty of the his love interest was as well.
Oh yeah i forgot anti-authoritarian, and pro-meritocracy.
Since I didn't see any actual governments in this movie, just a corporation, I hesitate to call it anti-authority. Meritocracy? Where are you pulling these out of? Oh I know, your ass.
Dude, just because there is a hero in the story does not mean the movie is individualist. Sexual liberty (bi-racial/bi-cultural in the movie) is a left wing theme. Good job proving my point.
Sexual liberty (bi-racial/bi-cultural in the movie) is a left wing theme.
WTF? You sound like an idiot, so please prove your point. Sexual liberty, like any liberty, is an individualist and freedom-loving theme. You might as well say sexual illiberty is a right-wing theme. I would say both sides consider only some sexual events to be correct.
"pro property rights pro free labor markets and pro liberty and pro religion informed morality and pro gun rights and pro local government"
Could you site any real examples of these views actually being fed to the audience? The destruction of the home tree was not about property rights, it was about the destruction of nature for money. Just because you one side using force on other side doesn't mean that there is any pro-liberty message here either. It was definitely pro-spiritualism, but not pro-morality-based-on-religion. And definitely not pro-local government. The pandorans didn't have govs, just a chief and priestess. The smoking doesn't represent any kind of pro-smoking message. Good job, buddy. You sure convinced me there are no left wing themes in this movie.
hmm, didn't seem to be anti war, at least not with that much violence in it.
The violence was initiated by the eeeeevil capitalist planetkilling humans. The smurfs were just defending themselves.
So it supports a strong planetary defense.
Also movies I see at movie theaters should have no smoking in them for the simple reason that seeing someone smoke makes me want to smoke.
Which, being unable to smoke in a theater, hurts the overall viewing experience.
This. I don't see how anyone can stand it. I think the same effect is the purpose of anti-smoking commercials.
And no beer either unless you're at one of those fancy theaters.
Home theater, people.
You know what I really don't get about Avatar?
You spend $400 million on amazing special effects, yet the subtitles are in cheap MS Word Papyrus font.
James Cameron stole my script!
Speaking of movies, I watched almost the whole trailer for the Book of Eli thinking "Wow, that was quick. I wasn't expecting to see a Fallout 3 movie for at least another year or two."
MIND MELD!
Regarding that NPR comment posted above, I wonder if the Left Intelligentsia did not find the caricatures of all those lefty beliefs sort of insulting. I mean, it almost seemed like James Cameron was mocking the left through an obvious exaggeration of all lefty ideas about capitalists and the environment.
Mind you, no capitalists in this Universe would have ever EVER freighted haul trucks, mining equipment, habitats, materials, food and people to a distant and harsh planet just to obtain a few rocks. Supposedly the rocks contained a very "valuable" mineral - what, Cameron never heard of substitutions? Doesn't Cameron know that the REAL money comes from selling cheap stuff in great quantities? Why does he think people use OIL today instead of WHALE oil, even when whale oil is more "valuable"?
Idiot.
Yeah, I do sort of get a whiff of that from the whole fantasy RPG angle I have been reading it on. If the whole thing is an analogy for MMPORGs and video games in general, then hat he's really saying is that the whole romantic noble savage stuff is just a big fantasy.
I mean, it almost seemed like James Cameron was mocking the left through an obvious exaggeration of all lefty ideas about capitalists and the environment.
You are confusing established sci-fi elements of a living planet with environmentalism, and what does Kelo in space have to do with capitalism?
Gee, maybe it was the oft-repeated line that humans had "killed their mother" by our abuses of our own planet. That, coupled with the capitalist caricatures who are supposedly obsessed with profits, yet repeatedly overlook myriad opportunities to make profits AND avoid spending money on military action.
And if you think Cameron intended this film to be about eminent domain, I've got a railroad yard in Brooklyn to sell you.
corning, do you actually believe what comes out of your brain or are you just retarded?
The movie was clearly environmentalist and anti-capitalist: "We must be one with nature, the humans are raping our planet for money, bla bla bla."
In response, director James Cameron says he considers smoking "a filthy habit" and does not view Weaver's character as "an aspirational role model" for teenagers:
She’s rude, she swears, she drinks, she smokes.
Weaver's character in Avatar is one of the good guys.
And, I won't Godwin the thread by naming a certain vegetarian, non-drinking, non-smoking sociopath of the early to mid-1900s.
Gandhi?
Good guess, but I think it could be any of a veritable plethora of progressives. Now, they were racists.
I don't recall Robert La Follette ever calling WEB DuBois a "negro communist".
I think the bad thing about this movie is there actually IS a good reason for the humans not to be digging up this planet. It has a unique and unusual ecosystem very unlike Earth's. While I do believe Cameron is recycling the same old tropes of criticizing European colonialism, what the humans are doing here is a lot worse. Does it remind anyone of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" wherein the protagonist is too perfect to be criticized?

New York Times to Financial Regulator: How Do You Do it?
The New York Times business section today interviews the "gung ho regulator" in charge of overseeing financial derivatives. So what are the tough questions we have for former Goldman Sachs partner (obviously)-turned Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler? I'll list every one of them:
You've been in the job since 2009. What's the most challenging aspect?
The C.F.T.C. has taken up much of the implementation of Dodd-Frank. How challenging has it been?
What's the most absurd complaint you’ve received about the new regulations?
How would you describe the response you've received from industry lobbyists?
Can your staff handle the load?
Republicans have said that the C.F.T.C. is moving too fast in developing regulations. Are they right?
Does it ever get overwhelming?
Which is tougher, life on Wall Street or life in Washington?
Would you ever go back to Goldman?
Why leave a profitable career to come to Washington?
Will you run for public office?
How are you coping as a single father?

Weathered Cedar Bed

Walnut Storage Bed
March 23, 2013
This custom piece started with a client that had her eye on a bed with drawers from a big-box retailer that looked right, but didn’t quite work right for her. I was able to offer solid walnut selected for its character and uniqueness, a handrubbed oil and wax finish, a split and angled headboard, and a metal bumper rail above the drawers. Tailored to work.
Redwood Bin Bed
February 23, 2013
Who doesn’t need more storage? The low profile structural deck of this bed allows huge rolling bins to park neatly below. Shown here in a king size, there is practically an entire closet underneath.
The redwood is reclaimed from NYC water tanks. A simple oil and wax finish shows off its beautiful natural red tones and the erratic black streaking gained from years of exposure to the elements. The bin pulls are custom made from salvaged leather strap and solid brass fasteners.
Wide Plank Bed

This bed celebrates the simple beauty of a great batch of antique yellow pine. orignal.
Claire Bed
July 25, 2012
Budget conscious and beautiful, this simple queen bed is done completely out of reclaimed spruce. Like all REASON beds, it eliminates the need for a box spring, freeing up valuable space underneath for storage. We are going to add four large rolling drawers under this one to take advantage of every square inch.

Madison Bed
September 21, 2011
This bed was commissioned through the wedding registry of two close friends. We joked from the beginning about what I would title the piece once it was time to publish it on reasonmodern.com. Their submissions swung from absurd to lewd as they made fun of my tendency to get a bit florid in my descriptions. Now, as I sit to write this, Madison Bed seems the obvious choice… and this one is for them:
The newlyweds are returning to their newly configured bedroom tonight from their wedding week in Madison, WI, where they met during our college years together so long ago. Serendipitously, I’m just now remembering that my supplier of deconstructed water tower wood informed me that this batch of redwood came from the demolition of a tower on Madison Ave. It was meant to be.
Like the couple, the bed combines the best of the Midwest and East Coast. It is as stout and strong as Bucky Badger himself, but it is styled to cast a slim profile in its urban environs. A subtle bend in the headboard offers chic detail, while unseen rear supports allow for comfortable, stable leaning. The platform is composed of antique spruce slats, custom milled for the job, and the tall skirt conceals about half of their extra thick pillow-top mattress. Double skid legs run the length of the structure, serving also as beams to form its strong spine. And when the happy couple is ready to pack up and head back to the dairy state, the whole thing breaks down easily to be reassembled with just four bolts.
All the best you two!
–Jake.

So what about that small minority known as the Catholic business owner? I ask every Catholic reading this blog post to take in hand their Sunday bulletin picked up at yesterday's mass and look at the back cover. There you will see, for the most part, advertising from Catholic-owned and operated businesses. [...]As Charlotte then points out, it is insane to think that one's Catholic identity must legally be confined to one's place of worship on Sunday mornings. Faith is meant to be lived, and if the living of that faith means that some Jewish deli owners don't sell ham or bacon and that some Muslim taxi drivers refuse to drive inebriated passengers and some Catholic business owners refuse to host fake gay "weddings," then our historic national appreciation of religious freedom should allow all of those things to be possible for people of faith.
Next, let's say that word gets out on the local level that Catholic Business X did a gay wedding. What would your reaction be? I know mine, and it's automatically imbued with sin. I'm going to mention it to fellow Catholic friends: "Did you hear that Catholic Business X catered a big gay wedding and reception?" And then they tell a friend, who tells someone they see at some business meeting, and they tell another, and then someone tells the priest, and on down the line it goes.
And then for next year's parish festival, Catholic Business X doesn't get a bid opportunity to rent out beer tents from the festival planning committee. Or maybe the owner of Catholic Business X notices that some parishioners at mass just aren't as friendly to him as they used to be.
See where I'm going with this?
I believe that a business is entitled to not have their reputation tarnished by laws demanding that services be provided which violate their religious beliefs. I believe that Catholics, whether corporately or privately, have a reasonable right to maintain reputation as a Catholic in good standing, which ultimately means that they should be able to exercise judgments and actions that are in line with the teachings of the Catholic faith.
With reference to the Catholic inn keepers in Vermont, it is being said that they have a free-standing Catholic chapel on their property, as well as a history of renting out their facilities to various Catholic groups. Knowing this, if they voluntarily agreed to host every gay wedding that walked through the door, what effect might that have on the stream of Catholic-based business that they already have? Likely, it would have a very negative effect simply because word gets around.
Worse, what if they were forced - by law - to accept every gay wedding that was requested? Some might answer, "Well, it wouldn't matter because we'd all understand that they had to do it. I wouldn't discriminate against that business/owner because they're just complying with the law."
Oh really? What if you booked a Catholic seminar at that inn one weekend, and once you and all the other Catholic attendees arrived, discovered that out on the grounds of the inn there was a gay wedding taking place? And what if the gay couple from the wedding were having professional photographs taken inside the little Catholic chapel on the premises? What if there were drag queens as guests at that wedding and some older folks attending the Catholic seminar were very uncomfortable with what they were seeing? For that matter, what if you had a teenager with you at that Catholic seminar, and during a break, your son or daughter caught sight of gay couples kissing each other?
You'd never book another event at that inn, ever. Period. [...]
So I ask this: WHY should these inn owners - or any Catholic-owned business - have to risk ruining their good business and/or Catholic reputation because the gay community insists that whatever they ask for must be provided?
Why do I say "some" religious believers will refuse to do certain things? Because, let's face it: there will always be plenty of unobservant or functionally irreligious people of various faiths who will take a childlike delight in turning against the actual practitioners. There may well be some Jewish people who argue in favor of selling ham, some Muslim people who argue in favor of giving rides to drunks, some Catholic people who think gay "weddings" are terrific, even some Buddhist people who would have no moral qualms about owning and running a slaughterhouse. But such people rarely speak for their faiths; in fact, they seem to enjoy speaking against them.
The truth is, such people are not usually the ones advertising in church bulletins (or the like, for other faiths) and trying to attract business among their fellow worshipers. So Charlotte's question still stands: why should Catholic business owners lose all of their Catholic business just because homosexuals insist that Catholics must accept and celebrate homosexual behavior to the point of participating in a "wedding" that the Catholics know fully well is a complete lie according to the Church?
I would like to see some answers to Charlotte's question. Do religious business owners have any right at all to act according to the dictates of their faith and consciences in the business sphere--or must everyone be forced to live as though secularism were our only faith, and religion a mere hobby to take part in on weekends, which is how militant atheistic secularism sees it?
61 comments:
Although I agree philosophically with a lot of what you and Charlotte hove said on this issue, I think that ultimately in this country businesses should not have the right to discriminate based on race, sex, sexual orientation, or religion. This is a good law that protects the fundamental notion of separation of church and state. And that separation is just as important in protecting mybright to worshipnhow I want, as it is in protecting the rights of consumers to NOT be punished for what they believe. It's a sacred right in my book and a big part of what makes this country great. Sadly, this does mean that as a catholic, I must at times "render unto ceasar". I must pay taxes even if I fundamentally disagree with how some are used. I must often conduct business at places who's philosophies, ideologies, and even business practices I might find wrong. I mean I can try not to, that's within my rights, but I bet Target isn't a business run perfectly by catholic standards. I haven't ever researched every single product that I buy, seeing who they give their money to and how they run their business. Places like walmart, and even the grocery store where I shop, treat their employees really shabbily. I don't shop at walmart, but I live in a tiny town that has one decent grocery store. I have to shop there.
So, I think that yes, as a catholic business owner, whether a pharmacist, doctor, cake decorated, florist, or wedding planner, it's time to start thinking about your faith and your moral qualms with what th laws of this country require. I'm sorry, but that is the price we pay for other fundamental freedoms. We certainly have the right to either continue conducting business according to the law, or get into a line of business that does not compromise our faith. And again, Christ himself said "render unto Ceasar". I understand that to mean that at a point, we are held responsible to just law.
Certainly, anti- discrimination laws are just. And we are free to make money other ways. Mel
I don't know of any court who would buy Charlottes's plea, which is legally indistinguishable from an innkeeper claiming that they would almost certainly suffer loss of business damages from their cracker clients if they served black ones. Remember, you will never be pleading in a Catholic or even a religious court.
The problem you're up against is how to document that you're acting out of religious conviction instead of arbitrary personal discrimination, and to do that I don't see how you can pick and choose which religious convictions of your faith you get to hold and which you get to ignore in order to book more business.
Seems to me the only way any court would take you seriously would be if you were consistent and claimed the right to refuse to serve any who violated any tenet of your faith, then provided a list of everything your faith prohibited, then took active steps to insure no potential customer was in violation of them. But saddling yourself with that sort of due diligence can be a pickle. Did you take reasonable steps to find out if that woman was divorced before you served her? If you refuse service to a homosexual after you've served a divorcee or an abortion doctor you've just arbitrarily discriminated against the homosexual based only on your personal whim, at least in the eyes of any court I'm familiar with.
How do you solve that problem, and how do you protect yourself and your loved ones from others who have to solve that very same problem with respect to having to deal with you?
For the record, Erin, I believe that small business owners should be able to follow their consciences, and that they shouldn't be required to allow what they see as sinful behaviour to take place on their facilities. I think those Vermont B & B owners should be able to deny use of their premises for a gay wedding. I'll go further and suggest that I think they should be allowed to forbid unmarried heterosexual couples, or previously divorced people, from sharing a room, if they so choose. (Many hotels used to do so, I believe). If I wanted to stay at their facility with a woman I wasn't married to, and they said no, I would just say 'okay' and go elsewhere, I certainly wouldn't start whining about it. I hope the B & B owners win their case, and that the court tells the narcissistic whiners to shut up and sit down.
That being said, I'm curious whether you think that business owners should be able to discriminate against RC lifestyle choices as well. I know more than a few people who think that having more than one or two children is immoral, for environmental reasons. If they owned, say, a photography business, should they be allowed to refuse to take family pictures of a Catholic household with six children?
Anonymous,
How come people didn't have to "pay the price" before, in this country, for those fundamental freedoms? Why now?
You also don't articulate an accurate or historical understanding of separation of church/state. The U.S. wasn't founded on the notion as you (and 99% of everyone else who doesn't understand it) describe. This country was founded with that separation so that religion and government would not be combined and wield power as one, united entity. Last time I checked, we haven't had yet a president who also claimed to be the supreme leader of a religious organization, so separation of church/state seems to be working just fine, as intended.
It was never intended to be as you're thinking or wishing.
The founding of the United State of America was based upon freedom to practice religion. Do people understand they they are now arguing for just the opposite? They are now arguing for the polar opposite of Americanism. That is VERY scary.
Glen,
No one has a right to refuse service to a homosexual.
Read closely all arguments concerning this topic.
Rather, it is the ACTION of the homosexual being performed and sanctioned live and in person, on the spot of the Catholic's property that is the issue. The homosexual wants to have a gay wedding, which is considered immoral and invalid by Church-believing Catholics.
People should read my blog post, since it's about Catholic REPUTATION, not this whole Vermont inn argument all over again.
But anyway, since we now have to rehash and review this whole thing, let it be known AGAIN, that the Vermont inn owners have vocally explained that they have rented rooms to homosexuals for a long time now and have not had a problem doing so. The problem was with a gay wedding. Homosexual and homosexual wedding are two different subjects. One is a person, one is an action. YES, you can separate the two.
I can ask a stripper over for dinner. But I might not want the stipper to actually strip in my home. I can object to the action performed, but not to the humanity and dignity of the person.
I think I'm gonna try and sue the next store that says "no shoes, no shirt, no service." I mean, that's discrimination against humans. How dare they tell me how to compose and comport myself in their place of business?
Fundamentally, I'm with Charlotte on this one. That is not a new thought for me. If she and I were both on the Supreme Court, we might write slightly different concurring opinions, keeping an eye on all the many different sets of facts that an appellate ruling will be applied to in the future.
For example, I believe that a nurse who is a devout Roman Catholic should be able to refuse participation in an abortion, without losing her job. If it is a hospital, there will be plenty of other nurses who could be called in (since the patient does have the legal right to schedule the procedure). I would expect such a nurse NOT to apply for work at a clinic where abortion is a large part of the workload, just as a vegetarian should not apply for work at a steak house, then object to being directed to serve a platter of beef.
When it comes to a pharmacist who has conscientious objections to filling a prescription for contraceptives, sorry, the customer has a right to get their prescription filled. Find another line of work. Or, find a pharmacy that does not, and advertises up front that it does not, keep contraceptives in stock. Maybe if there are two pharmacists on duty at all times, and at least one is prepared to fill the prescription, accommodations could be made.
Getting back to the RC couple running the B&B: The fact that there is an RC chapel on the grounds is significant. If it is in fact dedicated and consecrated as such, then the First Amendment and over 150 years jurisprudence protects that consecrated ground from being used for any purpose that would desecrate it, in the eyes of the RC church. The courts have NO jurisdiction over what that might be. They follow the law of the highest judicatory of the church, period, in matters of faith and doctrine.
In this regard, Charlotte is correct that the First Amendment protects citizens from any given faith being established as a power in or over the state, AND, protects individual free exercise. "Separation of church and state" does not, and never has, meant that what the state deems acceptable is mandatory for the church, or for the individual private conscience.
Everyone who has offered an opinion here knows that it is lawful for a business to limit its offerings to kosher food, or halal food, or products that conform to any similar religious prescription or proscription, and to advertise it as such. IF the owner of a kosher business refused to sell to a willing buyer because "I don't sell to Arabs," or the owner of a halal business because "I don't sell to infidels," THAT would be a violation of well established equal access to public accommodations law. But, a Roman Catholic could not barge in and insist that a kosher or halal butcher should slaughter their freshly bought pig, and sue for discrimination.
If the couple running the B&B says "We only host weddings that are recognized as such by the RC church" they would be more akin to limiting their fare to halal, kosher, or, in this case, RC canon. Maybe they could in good conscience host a reception for a wedding conducted under the rubric of "the scandal of Protestantism," or maybe they could not. They should be willing, if a gay man and a lesbian woman sought to enter into marriage with each other, to host that wedding reception. It is the product that they are being specific about, not the characteristics of the individuals.
Many states these days do require landlords to rent apartments without inquiring as the marital status or carnal intentions of the prospective tenants. Generally, I think that is OK, because everyone needs a place to live, and the landlord is renting housing, not a place for sex, which is incidental to occupancy. There are, in most such laws, exceptions when the owner resides on the premises, with four units or less. That's appropriate also. That's where personal preference has a place, not matter what the burden on the tenant.
Hector,
People refuse business all the time, for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes they say why, other times they don't and come up with excuses.
In the case of the photographer, I say yes, they can decide they don't want to photograph the large family for whatever reason they want. Should they be tacky enough to say their real reasons why? Probably not. But hey, if offending people is their thing, then go for it.
I said before I think the Vermont inn owners should have been smarter and just said they made a mistake and were already booked that day. Might not have made a difference, though, since I believe 100% (despite what the official "story" is) that these inn owners were targeted from the beginning.
Erin, I'm not sure if I'm amused or saddened to see that, again, no one can appreciate or respect religious freedom as guaranteed in this country since the constituion was first conceived. They cannot see past the facts of this Vermont case to the bigger issues that you have written about or that I have written about. They actually appear to prefer and desire a society free of religious freedom and free of freedom of religious expression. I seriously don't get it. Do they think abolition of these freedoms won't affect them? They must - they think gay marriage won't affect us, either. It's astonishing to watch even Catholics here say thay we need to shut up or get out of business.
This stuff should be solved by everyone relaxing a little. There are plenty of businesses willing to host a same-sex wedding reception. That is where such business should be going. I see Hector and I are using the same phrase for those who want to make everyone accommodate their every whim. Narcissistic whiners is exactly what they are.
But this won't be solved by relaxed common sense. It will be sorted out in the courts. The couple should take some care how they present their case, but it is winnable. An instructive case is
HURLEY ET AL. v. IRISH-AMERICAN GAY, LESBIAN AND BISEXUAL GROUP OF BOSTON, INC., ET AL
In an opinion by that well-know right wing reactionary, David Souter, the Supreme Court said there is no right to impose your speech on the organizers of a parade, so no, the Massachusetts public accommodations law does NOT give the Irish Gay and Lesbian contingent the right to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. (They should have just called themselves the Sir Roger Casement Battalion).
A B&B is a public accommodation. That is a difference, in terms of judicial reasoning. But as Charlotte says, they are limiting the kind of services they provide, not discriminating as to who may purchase those services.
Siaryls,
I agree with your pharmacist analogy with one exception. If the pharmacist works for Walgreens or CVS, etc., then yes - filling a prescription for contraceptives should not be denied.
But if it is a privately owned pharmacy (a rarity these days, but they still do exist), then no. If the pharmacy is privately owned by a Catholic, then they can refuse to fill that contraception prescription.
You can call me Mel. The separation of church and state applies equally to all three of the ruling government branches, of which the judicial branch is one. Meaning that our laws do indeed have to protect that right. It does not just mean that our governing body cannot also be a religious one. It has a broader application than that. And, no, finally, businesses is this country just don't get to "make up" their own rules. They are very closely restricted
as to how they conduct business to protect the rights of consumers. This is not new information. Lawyers make their living every day because of these restrictions. I know it really bothers you, but bottom line it's not a new idea. It will be up to Catholics to decide how to morally conduct business as best they can. We aren't being persecuted here.
"I wanted to stay at their facility with a woman I wasn't married to"
In your dreams, Hector :+)
I just went to that inn's website. (Inn? It's a huge complex! And very family friendly - accomodations and activities for kids and even scheduled programs for kids.)
Anyway, on their "weddings" tab they have a statement that they are no longer accomodating weddings or other special events.
See? Loss of business, as I predicted. Because some whiners don't have the grace and dignity to take "no" for an answer and find one of a myriad of other places that would roll out the red carpet for them.
People are becoming barbarians.
Well anyway, good for them. They are protecting their reputations as Catholics, and as Catholic business owners.
Oh PS. I'm not saying I like Charlotte, I am just saying this is what living in a " free" country means for better or worse.
I would not trade it for a catholic monarchy, which I sometimes fear the arguments ultimately lead. Do I hate that abortion is okay? Absolutely. But, again, result of a free country. Do I deeply dislike marriage being redefined? Absolutely. Again, free country. My religion cannot dictate our laws. Separation of church and state. That leaves it up to me- as with the Inn owners ultimately- to decide how to conduct myself as a catholic business owner. And I am talking business only here. I am not talking about a churches right to refuse, just a money making businesses right to. Mel
Re: Do I hate that abortion is okay?
Abortion is hardly a comparable issue. The idea that "killing innocent human beings, except maybe in self defence, is, you know, wrong" isn't limited to Catholics, it's one that all reasonable and decent people hold, or ought to.
Siarlys Jenkins,
I'm indebted to you for the "Narcissistic Whiner" phrase. :)
I've been away from the blog for a bit; want to respond to some of these comments.
Glen seems to equate the deeply held and consistently-taught religious beliefs of a major world religion as to the nature and purpose of marriage with unjust racial prejudice. That, I fear, is what will lead to the rights of Catholics being stripped away in the wake of gay "marriage" decisions.
Mel, I think you're confused about just and unjust discrimination in a business context. A vegetarian restaurant does not have the right to ban meat-eaters from eating in their restaurant. The restaurant does, however, have the right to refuse to cook meat for the meat-eaters or to allow the meat eaters to use hibachi grills in the parking lot to cook their own meat to consume in the restaurant. Public accommodation does not mean, "I must consent to your behavior in all circumstances."
And gay "weddings" are about behavior, not merely accommodation; the Catholic innkeepers should not, as Charlotte says, be forced to celebrate the sin of gay "marriage" and face the resulting loss of business from the Catholic families who would refuse to stay at an inn hosting a gay "wedding."
As far as the separation of church and state: some of us would say that as marriage pre-dates the state, the state does not have jurisdiction to redefine or abolish marriage. I firmly believe we're heading toward the abolition of civil marriage in this nation, and anybody who shrugs and says "Oh, well, that's up to the state," doesn't really understand Catholic social teaching or the likelihood that vulnerable women and their children will suffer the most under such an arrangement.
I think what I am trying to say is that businesses in this country are already restricted in many many ways as to how they operate. I don't see, necessarily, this issue as being uniquely a catholic one or even uniquely a religious one. And what I was trying to say is that those restrictions are important and are generally put in place to protect both the business and the consumer and respect a kind of over all fairness in business practice. So, even though I agree that it is completely disengenuious of the Lesbian couple to push themselves on the Catholic B&B, I am in favor of consumers rights and protections in general. And I am
pretty sure the reaction of the owners of the B&B on their
website is a reflection of where their lawyers advised them
that the law would come down on in this case. I am open
to the fact that none of my points are being articulated very
well given the state of my 8 1/2 months pregnancy induced
stupidity. :-). Mel
Finally, I am not saying I like it. I am just saying that legally I am not sure how work to out a legal happy medium whereby a business owners personal beliefs could somehow be upheld while practicing fair business practices. I think that is just an impossible road to go down realistically. Some problems have already been raised. But more significant to me as a Catholic, is someone deciding they could refuse me service based on that. Or, based on say, the fact that I am pregnant with my 5th child. I just feel business practices should be required to err on the side of consumer and employees rights and protections. Mel
I take Erin's question: "do religious business owners have any right..." as a legal question and have been trying to research the answer, as opposed to offering a personal opinion (which again, I think is not what Erin is asking for).
Yet I'm finding it difficult to come to the correct legal conclusion under Vermont law.
To the extent it is helpful, the topic seems to be "Religious Conscience Protection Laws," also called "Religious Refusal Laws." I see they exist at various state and federal levels. Many seem to arise in response to health care and gay marriage issues. For example, I've come across a CT bill (can't tell if it was enacted)that covers a "religious organization, association or society, or any nonprofit institution," but not an individual or private business owner. The legislature appears to have debated extending the protection that far, but pulled back:
 and such solemnization or celebration is in violation of their religious beliefs and faith."
Iowa also recently tried to enact a similar law but it cratered b/c it was too broadly drafted and would allow a private business to deny services not only to gay married couples but also to cross-religious married couples (e.g. Catholic-Lutheran), if the business owner's personal religious beliefs were violated by a cross-religious marriage.
I don't know why a private business owner in Iowa should be prevented from denying his service to a cross-religious marriage, but that seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back on that law.
So, it seems that laws exist at the State level (varying from state to state) and at the federal level.
I'm not finding a RCPA in VT, but it might be out there or buried in another law or called something else.
I hope this was informative.
Thanks, Peter, that was informative.
The cross-religion marriage thing is weird. The Catholic objection to gay marriage is, of course, that a marriage between two members of the same sex is impossible and invalid. A Catholic would never object to a valid marriage between two people of the opposite sex and/or different religions.
Seriously, while many Christian religions (including Catholicism) highly recommend and warn against marrying someone not of the same religion, no one that I know of disallows it. I can't even think of one! (Can anyone else come up with an example? Now I'm just intrigued to know.)
For that to have been any kind of consideration in the law-making process in Iowa must have meant either there was a really loud/vocal minority contingent off their rocker OR there was a liberal contingent (pro-gay marriage) that introduced this concept as a canard to confuse the process.
At any rate, I believe that there are law books filled with religious objection/conscience cases that don't apply to marital siuations, but involve other matters and issues. I belive that THOSE would be used as prescedent-setting cases, since as you're trying to determine, there's nothing else to go on.
When I searched for my biological mother, I discovered that she was a Jehovah's Witness. I have spent alot of time talking with her about her faith, and have discovered that the life of a committed, practicing JW is filled with religious objections that must be explained and fought for. (Actually, I am of the opinion - and I'm not the only one out there who believes this - that the JW's have done more for protection of religious belief in modern times than anyone.) There are hundreds of cases out there from the JW's, and to the best of knowledge, they win almost every time.
For what it's worth, that's another religion where I'm very positive that if the inn owner had been a JW, they wouldn't have allowed the gay wedding either. In their case, I believe the lesbians would have just have left them alone because JW's are kooks and weirdos, right? But Catholics? They're always good for a fit and a lawsuit. At least that's the impression I get lately.
Maybe I'm being redundant--but isn't the whole center of the problem the fact that Vermont officially recognizes same-sex relationships as eligible for marriage? Once that kind of law is passed, it seems like the way is paved now for this kind of persecution. Just as, when abortion/contraception are officially recognized as "medical procedures", it has the potential of pushing all Christians, Jews, and anyone who recognizes moral law, out of the medical field. Maybe there is a certain amount of protection we can claim still, but the official state recognition is going to be key. Going back to the racial analogy, which is obnoxious I know, but I could see someone saying that for religious reasons, they cannot recognize a wedding between a black man and a white woman, as a real marriage. But I could see them being (justly) sued for discrimination, even though their beef is not with the black man but with his action. So I guess what I'm saying is that religious rights, personal rights and those things that our country has always held sacred--those things aren't going to exist in a vacuum, and they are going to be turned upside down and inside out, in a state which officially endorses perversity and self-destruction. I don't mind re-thinking this, if anyone wants to correct my reasoning...
Also I would like to re-iterate, for those who don't seem to get it, that the owner of a B & B does not have an obligation (or even a right) to closely examine everyone staying at their B & B, about their marital status or sex life. Any more than a priest has an obligation to question every communicant about whether he has been attending Sunday Mass, etc. It is when someone is in a professed, public state of sin, that the priest is obligated to withhold communion. For obvious reasons. Likewise the owner of the B & B may assume all is well, unless there is a public profession that the couple intends to use the facilities for an immoral purpose, or if it is otherwise obvious--for instance, if a seventeen-year-old boy comes in with a twelve-year-old girl...it would be right to ask questions in that case. This should all be obvious to anyone with a moderate measure of common sense.
I'm sorry that came out as "anonymous", it was me, Rebecca.
In connection with a family wedding, I was told by a RC priest last year that a RC priest may not perform a marriage ceremony to a person who is not baptized. Is that an accurate statement of RC marriage laws? If so, isn't that an examplle of a particular religion disallowing cross-faith marriage?
Peter, someone else would have to answer on that. My recall (which may be very bad/wrong) is that it can be done if the bishop says it's OK. That's called a dispensation.
You know, Red (and you know this already), the reason many of these people think we're completely nuts and bigots, etc., is because 3/4ths of all American Catholics don't practice their faith anyway. Plus they don't know what the Church teaches. So WE get branded as the extremists, when in fact, the others aren't even, really (in some sense) Catholic at all. We get judged based upon them. Which always begs the question of: Why do they bother to be Cathlolic or self-identify as Catholic at all?
Especially about the Eucharist. If you don't believe it's really the body and blood of Christ, why not leave? Isn't it that 60-some percent of Catholics don't believe? I mean, really, then find some place that works for you. It's these catholic-in-name-only who don't know/practice the faith that cloud this issue of gay marriage. If Catholics were unified in their understanding of Catholic teaching and everyone on the outside knew it, I don't think people would be all that astonished by situations like the one in Vermont.
I am far from an expert on Islamic law, but a quick internet search leads to some persuasive authority tha Muslim men are discouraged from interfaith marriage and Muslim women are prohibited from interfaith marriage.
Laws that are fundamentally bad can be recognized by their tendency to warp basic foundational principles like life and liberty.
Lincoln pointed out how the slavery question infested issues like the admission of new states and the formation of new territories, and was at the root of schisms of the large protestant sects of his day, as well having an impact on supreme court appointments, and virtually every election.
Today, abortion is at the heart of every supreme court appointment, and of most elections. Here in Texas, murdering a child under 5 is a capital crime -- unless that child has not been born yet. In many places, acts that inadvertantly take the life of the unborn are criminal, but intentionally taking the life of the unborn is not.
This sort of warping of common sense and legal consistency is the hallmark of morally repugnant law.
Same-sex "marriage" is no different. "Husband" and "wife", "father" and "mother" are becoming politically incorrect terms (in California, birth certificates now have spaces for "parent A" and "parent B"). School books, already re-written to teach the new regime, are being adopted in every state that has civil unions. Businesses run by Christians -- not Moslems, mind you -- are targeted for litigation. Traditional morality is equated with bigotry, and religious faith is now seen as a barrier to entry in a variety of professions and occupations.
It's insanity. And sane people will not embrace or enable it.
Re: I can't even think of one! (Can anyone else come up with an example? Now I'm just intrigued to know.)
Charlotte,
As I understand it, the Eastern Orthodox Church does not permit its members to marry non-Christians (it permits, but discourages them from marrying Christians from non-Orthodox confessions). The marriage of former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, for example, wasn't recognized by his church because his wife was Jewish.
Peter,
Muslim men are permitted to marry Christian or Jewish women, but not women of any other religion. (I know a Muslim man whose Hindu fiance converted to Christianity to marry him, believe it or not.) Muslim women are prohibited from marrying outside their faith. Obviously, Muslims vary in how seriously they take the prohibition, and unlike Christianity, Islam lacks centralized clerical authorities.
Re: Likewise the owner of the B & B may assume all is well,
Rebecca in ID,
If a straight couple without wedding rings walks into a B & B and asks for a room, don't you think the default presumption is that they're maybe going to be breaking Catholic sexual teachings?
Seriously, while I think Catholics (and members of other religions) have the right not to allow their premises to be used for activities they disapprove of (whether gay sex, drinking alcohol, eating beef, or what have you), if these rules were enforced on straight people as well as gays then I don't think there would be this many frivolous lawsuits.
Hector, if I can answer your question to Rebecca: not at all! In the first place, the absence of wedding rings does not denote the absence of a valid marriage--I recall a hilarious story of a young bride in Alaska in about 1960 flying into a major city and trying to deposit money in her new joint bank account--only to have to explain that she didn't wear a ring because of an allergy to gold, she didn't have a driver's license because she flew a plane in the part of Alaska where she lived and where cars were essentially useless (and back then, pilots' licenses weren't photo i.d.s though they probably are now), and she didn't have her marriage license because the wedding had only happened three days before and the certificate hadn't been mailed to the couple yet. She eventually convinced the bank that she was the wife of the account holder (these days, though...!).
So, a married couple might not wear rings for one reason or other--but beside that, are you going to grill or interrogate every male/female couple that walks in as to their relationship and intention to engage in what ought to be marital activity? The couple might be brother and sister (and if the sister is married, her last name might be different). The couple might be friends (and the man might be same-sex attracted, so that there's no moral danger whatsoever for him to share a room with his attractive female heterosexual friend). There might be a dozen other perfectly reasonable explanations as to why a male/female couple without wedding rings wishes to share a room, without the assumption that they want the room for illicit activity (unless, of course, the hotel is the sort of place which rents rooms by the hour, which is not the sort of place a Catholic ought to own, anyway).
So: denying people of any gender a room for the night is vastly different than saying, "We do not host same-sex "weddings" because of our deeply held, centuries-old religious beliefs according to which these "weddings" are fake, the pairs not truly married in the eyes of God or man, and the whole charade an affront to decent people who value virtue and morality." And as far as I'm concerned, Catholic innkeepers ought to have the legal right to say that.
Charlotte, this was a good deal of water under the bridge and many comments ago, but I agree that an individual pharmacy might well choose, and advertise, not to stock contraceptives at all. For that matter, they could choose not to stock antibiotics. They are subject to the vagaries of the market - how many customers they will attract, retain, or discourage from coming back - but not to lawsuits.
The only other issue that seems outstanding (we all know where each of us stands on abortion, so no need to throw that into the mix again), is the question of what level and kind of state regulation a business is subject to. There seems to be an assumption being floated that, because the state must be neutral in matters of religion, and because businesses are licensed and regulated by the state, therefore a business must be neutral in matters of religion. That is without any constitutional or legal foundation.
COMMERCE is subject to regulation by the state. Religion is, by definition, not commerce, although if a religious body runs a commercial subsidiary, whether that be a thrift store or a winery, the business is subject to regulation, and tax, as a business.
This comes up over and over in the fatuous "Christmas Wars," which exist more in the eye of media anxious to drum up another story than in the minds and hearts of people trying to celebrate their favorite holiday(s). Can a business post an explicitly religious theme in its windows? Absolutely. Do people who are offended have to shop there? No, they can go elsewhere. Do large chains trying to cater to the maximum clientele tend to water things down? Yes, its good business to do so. Is that wrong? No, its their option.
The owners of a B&B are under no state-imposed obligation to be religiously neutral. They can put crucifixes in every room if they want. They can paint a mural of the Temptation of St. Anthony all around their dining room. That may or may not be a sound business decision, but it is no business of the state.
The only plausibly valid argument is that the state may impose nondiscrimination laws. We've beaten to death that "nondiscrimination" is about equal access to the services the business offers, NOT demanding that it offer whatever a given customer wants.
So, they cannot turn away customers because "you are not of the right faith," or we only serve 'mericans, or we don't like your color, or your turban, and in many states, they can't turn a customer away because "you're gay, and we don't want your kind here."
So the question -- which we have all covered pretty thoroughly, is whether refusing to host a same-sex wedding is per se discrimination against people who are gay. I would say no, and I've already said why, as have many others.
Finally, I agree with Erin that declining to host a celebration of a same-sex marriage is not similar to discrimination on the basis of race. Everyone since 1965 who feels they are "discriminated against" wants to cast themselves as "the new black," but they are not. They each have their own case to make.
Red, though, I'm interested in what you think about the way the changing of the law pretty much might challenge that right. So for example, the B and B would not be required to celebrate a shacking up ceremony on their premises, because they do weddings, not shacking up ceremonies. But once the state formally recognizes a "wedding" of a same sex couple...isn't there a fundamental change there, and don't you see it as difficult to maintain the position of religious freedom amid that? It seems like a losing battle as long as those kinds of laws are being changed.
I'm with you on your reply to Hector. Huge difference between a public declaration/celebration and what people may choose to do privately. Which is why it is not necessarily inconsistent to oppose a law against sodomy while also opposing a state redefinition of marriage to include same-sex relationships. St. Thomas Aquinas talks about how it is imprudent to try to make laws which cannot reasonably be enforced--it lessens the force of law to do so--and likewise it is imprudent to try to make lists of rules which would require prying in order to enforce. That is worlds different than openly, publicly celebrating wrong actions.
Rebecca, I'll go further than you: the whole reason gay rights agitators have forced the change of the law in various states is because they wish to silence, punish, and marginalize anyone who holds to the religious (Catholic, Christian, Orthodox Jewish, Muslim, and other) belief that gay sex acts are immoral, that putting the stamp of a fake "marriage" license on them does not make them moral, and that there is no comparison whatsoever between a heterosexual marriage and homosexual pairings.
And this is what is wrong.
Consider that a relatively short (100 years or so) time ago, sex before marriage--fornication--was seen by society at large as a character weakness, a clear deviation from virtue, and a problem to be resolved by the marriage of the guilty parties (the phrase, "You should make an honest woman of her" didn't come from nowhere). Now, the idea that fornication is immoral is widely laughed at, and society thinks it is more insulting to a young man or woman--especially a woman--to think he or she is *not* behaving like a promiscuous slut than to hint that he or she might actually be chaste and virtuous. "Virgin" has become an intolerable insult, to be flung only at those young men or women the mob dislikes; and the poor young person called a virgin is expected to yell "Am not! You take that back!" as if to be assumed to be pure is the most insulting thing anyone can assume about you.
The fiction of gay "marriage" can only be maintained in a world in which chastity and virtue are completely denigrated. Same-sex couples do not "save themselves for marriage" and would find it horrifically insulting to be told that they ought to do so. They do not marry to "make honest men/women of each other," as sodomy is still immoral whether one is "married" or not (and, indeed, whether one is heterosexual or not). So to destroy the last, tiny vestiges of the ideal of chastity and virtue, gay rights advocates must first change the laws to demand "marriage," and then silence, marginalize, exclude, and punish anyone who values traditional morality, chastity, purity, or the idea that sex is about more than producing temporary physical pleasure through friction.
If we don't stand up for the very different Catholic take on marriage, sex, morality, virtue, chastity, and gender complementarity which has transcendent meaning as applied to the relationship between Christ and His Church, we'd better get used to the idea that any focus on these things will be labeled as "hate speech," and the Church herself as a "hate group" for insisting that all sex outside of *real* marriage is still gravely sinful and puts its practitioners in the serious danger of the eternal death of Hell. I'm not quite ready to shut up and give in to the sodomites on this one, probably because I see where we're headed, and how absolutely destructive it will be for our children, and our children's children, to grow up in a society which has moved from merely laughing at virtue to openly and persistently attacking it in its defiled and irredeemably corrupt institutions.
Good discussion, all. As a pharmacist, though, I take umbrage to the idea that even privately owned independent pharmacies have the 'right' to deny sale of contraceptives. I will bring up two points. 1.) Herein a business is a business, and not entitled to act as an individual as what the Constitution was originally designed. It's getting scarier and scarier that corporations and groups of people seem to have access or rights 'above' or 'equal' to individuals. For the record, pharmacies receive much funding from federal and state programs i.e. their Medicaid-, and Medicare-eligible patients pay for their drugs in tax-payer funded programs. The pharmacist is licensed to perform a public function in the public arena in society. Physicians, teachers, hair dressers do not provide the drugs and information unless they are also licensed pharmacists. There are not private pharmacists providing select prescriptions for patients.
2.) Now, say, if one could overlook the fact that pharmacists are duly obligated by society to perform their duty in providing drugs, and were working, say, in a different capacity, such as solely providing advice, or checking drug interactions, NOT performing their duty, the argument could be let up a bit. Nevertheless, unless a patient has adequate opportunity or access to getting their prescription filled within a reasonable time by alternative pharmacies that provide the prescription product, then the patient DESERVES or has the right to get their prescription filled whether the owner has a decided position on the matter or not.
Those were my main two points, but on the other hand, if I as a pharmacist know that my patient has been given a prescription for a drug or dose that will kill them or seriously hurt them or is likely to do damage, then I can use my pharmacist's judgment and refuse to fill.
Will I knowingly fill a script for a drug that cause fetal death or birth defects in a woman who is obviously or reportedly pregnant? I don't think so. I will call the physician and tell that I'm not filling it and why.
Zircon
Red, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
When you say "If we don't stand up", do you mean you standing up yourself, or someone else standing up in place of you for what you want to see done? And how are you going to be doing this standing up, on a blog or in stories, or out there confronting people doing things you don't like in a legally governed world? Are you going to stand up by lobbying your representatives? I see on the side there you have already sworn against voting for Republicans, so threatening not to vote for them if they don't do what you want wouldn't seem to carry much weight, at least with Republicans.
The reason I ask these things is, if you're going to stand up yourself and try to take on gay marriage or fornication or whatever yourself, how do you plan to defend yourself against counter attack? It's all well and good to say you're doing it out of religious principles rather than just out of some arbitrary personal spite, but if someone counter attacks you legally claiming you are simply arbitrarily harassing them, you're going to have to be able to prove some consistent pattern of standing up against all behavior your religion specifically prohibits as immoral. Otherwise you won't have a legal leg to stand on, and you could lose everything that can't be shielded in bankruptcy.
So what's your plan for standing up? Of course if it's just blogging about it so that you and others can gripe, no worries. You're just talking, and we all know speech is protected. Beyond that, though, how does someone, maybe someone else if you don't do it yourself, stand up the way you're calling for while protecting themselves from crossing onto the wrong side of the law in doing so? That's assuming they care what side of the law they're on, which we'd assume they would. Hope that wasn't too many questions, but it just seems a lot easier to talk about what you're talking about than to really do anything, unless of course you've already decided to accept whatever the real world costs and consequences of doing something might be, like being legally convicted of malicious harassment and having to declare bankruptcy to shed a judgement.
So how does someone do what you're calling for?
Glen, I've addressed this sort of thing before, and it's beyond the scope of a comment box, but the kind of "standing up" I see myself willing to engage in has to do with being willing to help create a sort of parallel society in which I am not required by law to acknowledge or directly participate in evil.
Rod Dreher used to refer to this as the "Benedict Option," by which he meant forming intentional communities to stand apart from (and in many cases, in opposition to) the many evils of modern American secularism--not merely to oppose evil, but to teach and strengthen others in the practice of virtue and goodness as Christianity is mandated to do. I've spoken of the idea here both to praise its strengths and criticize some weaknesses; but in general I think this is where Catholics may end up, fifty or a hundred years from now., and will probably not get well underway until the religious persecution I see as the inevitable result of forcing gay "marriage" on the nation has made a lot more of my fellow Catholics aware of the lengths we'll have to go to in order to preserve an authentically Catholic identity in the midst of a militantly atheistic and secularist nation bent on spreading its errors around the world. Will I even live long enough to see that point? Who knows? But like I said to someone elsewhere, I will at least know that if the secular nation in the future tries to create the fiction that no Catholics really cared much about gay "marriage" and the loss of religious freedom when all of that was happening, the words of those of us writing against this slide into national degeneracy will serve as a contradiction to the predominant narrative.
Now, for myself, personally, as I've also said before, I would also consider leaving America for a saner, more pro-Catholic country--the problem is that this militant atheistic secularism is America's chief import, and there may not be a sane corner of the globe left to migrate to even if that became a realistic option for my family.
I'd like to make the point, too, that blogging, writing, speaking is not doing nothing--it falls under instructing the ignorant, if it is done well, and can be powerful. And in fact I would go so far as to say that if there were not a number of intelligent people writing and speaking on these topics, the battle would quickly be lost. Those of us who do not have the time or talent for that, or for more directly political activity--we're educating our children and teaching them to live principled lives. And more and more, ordinary people will find themselves in situations where they can choose to compromise with the Culture of Death, or not. My husband sends SMS messages for various companies for a living.. My husband wrote a letter explaining that their company could not include these messages in their service, and the reply was three lawyers on the other end, threatening to sue and destroy the company. When they found out how small and insolvent the company was, they let it go because it was not worth their time--but if it had been worth their time, they may well have won. I know more and more people in various fields who have had to face various situations like this. It's becoming less and less theoretical.
You said,
,"
I don't see how what you wrote above would be a long slow process, seems like you and anyone else who wanted to could do it tomorrow. Of course it would limit your options, but that's what you say you want to do anyway. You might have to give up some things you're enjoying now, but how important could they really be compared to what you really want?
I don't see the problem. Why don't you and whoever else feels like doing what you say you want to do there just do it? Problem solved.
The "slow process" part, Glen, involves letting those Catholic businesses know we're going to support them and helping them get started (an idea which also ties in to distributism, which I'm still learning about).
For instance, you say, "So: go to a Catholic doctor! Go to a Catholic pharmacy!" etc. I do go to a Catholic doctor (though if I want to go to a pro-life, NFP only doctor there aren't many available where I live; alas, the one I used to go to had to quit practicing due to serious health issues of her own, from what I understand). I would love to support a Catholic pharmacy, but there isn't one. Heck, I'd love to shop at a Catholic version of WalTarMartGet etc. so I could buy toothpaste and soap without having to walk by the stupid condom aisle, or stand in the check-out line next to magazines decorated by scantily clad women posed beside headlines full of salacious details about how I can please my man (feminism in action, those magazines, don't you know). The Catholic store would be closed on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, and have a really nice religious goods department, too! Ah, dreams. :)
But, like I said, such a company would have to know that enough of us would shop there--and they'd also have to be aware that they'd probably be sued on a near daily basis for the imaginary hurt feelings of openly gay customers and/or would-be employees, in addition to being sued for *not* selling condoms or Cosmo. So, again, a slow process to get to the point where a Catholic alternative community could exist in peace is indicated.
Re:.
I think that your husband's company should have the right not to send those messages, if they don't feel they can do so in good conscience. By the same token, they should make their opinions known in advance, and Columbia University should feel free to contract with a different company.
Re: That is worlds different than openly, publicly celebrating wrong actions.
By the same token, though, if the state treated gay sex as something 'wrong, but tolerated', isn't that infringing on the religious freedom of those people who don't believe that homosexuality is immoral?
I don't personally believe that a gay relationship is quite the same thing as a marriage, and I don't want my church performing gay marriages, but I also don't want the state to send the message that it thinks gay relationships, or gay sex, is immoral and wrong. Because I don't believe they are.
I don't really see there's a painless solution here: whatever the consensus our society comes to about the morality (or lack thereof) of homosexuality, someone's religious or moral views are going to be offended. There's simply no way around that.
Hector,
I agree with your last paragraph--which is why I think it just doesn't work for people to try to work out how we can tiptoe in just the right way so as not to offend anyone. It won't happen, it is not possible, and true freedom, which is defined a little differently than "not stepping on anyone's toes" cannot happen in a society which refuses to recognize or outright contradicts the moral law.
Glen,
So why don't all the homosexuals go off and start their own intentional communities, run the way they want?
You seemed so eager for us to do it. They could just as easily do the same. Or would that sound too much like the whole AIDS/island idea from the 80's?
"By the same token, though, if the state treated gay sex as something 'wrong, but tolerated', isn't that infringing on the religious freedom of those people who don't believe that homosexuality is immoral?"
Yeah, if you think "religious freedom" means being able to do *anything* you want. Would you say the same thing about people who want to have open consensual sexual relations with animals? Or people who want to have four or five wives, consensually, of course? And demand that they be given access to the B and B's facilities for these things? I'm not sure where you personally, Hector, draw the line, but I'm pretty sure you draw the line *somewhere*. I'm pretty sure that you think people should be able to pursue happiness in their fashion--but that there are certain lines which just ought not be crossed, ought not at least be recognized as honorable or sanctioned by the state, regardless of how deeply held those convictions might be for those who want such actions sanctioned. Right? And my guess is, you think that somehow, that basic information, that basic instinct and those first principles, concerning those lines which ought not be crossed--you think that is knowledge is somehow accessible to everyone, don't you? If it's not, if it's just your private opinion, then what grounds are there for any kind of limiting of the definition of marriage, or limiting of any kind of behavior whatsoever?
Re: It won't happen, it is not possible, and true freedom, which is defined a little differently than "not stepping on anyone's toes" cannot happen in a society which refuses to recognize or outright contradicts the moral law.
All that is quite true. FTR, I'm not a philosophical liberal, and I think that plenty of behaviours (sexual, economic, and others) ought to be suppressed or at least discouraged. I just don't agree with you that contraception and homosexuality are among them.
And I don't see a good reason that the government should support the teaching of your church that homosexuality is a sin, over the teaching of my church that it isn't.
All that being said, I think you have the right, if you wish, to believe that contraception and homosexuality are wrong, and you also have the right not to have your business participate in supporting those activities. As long as the college women can go elsewhere to get the pill, and the lesbian couples can go elsewhere to get married, then I don't see why Catholic business owners need to violate their own moral sensibilities.
okay, so good, there is a point of agreement: you seem to be saying that there is an objective moral law, which ought to be able to be recognized by all reasonable people, and the state should have something to say about that as well. I agree with that. Your church's "belief" vs. my Church's "belief" don't really have to do with that, if we're talking about something knowable by reason, so whether homosexuality and contraception are wrong, should be able to be hashed out, and we ought to be able to some agreement on that. Maybe that would take a few years, but anyway.
The thing I would challenge apart from that point, though, is that there can be such a thing as a state *sanctioning* certain behavior *while* guaranteeing religious freedom to oppose or refuse to participate in such behavior. As I've been saying, I think once the law recognizes something as legitimate, equal to other things, good and honorable, etc., it *is* going to result in a tension which has to give. Religious freedom is freedom to do what you want according to your religion *within the confines* of decent behavior, and once the state *sanctions and blesses* sexual perversity, it *will* become impossible to maintain a position of "religious freedom", because anything opposing the state's official view, will be considered *not decent*, not within the confines of decent behavior. You already see the racial analogies being made. It isn't decent to refuse service to a person because of the color of his skin, right? And people *cannot* make the distinction between that, and the refusal to participate in or celebrate immoral actions. It is seen as indecent not to let them have their reception there, and if you can't be decent, why, get out of the B & B business.
Re: The thing I would challenge apart from that point, though, is that there can be such a thing as a state *sanctioning* certain behavior *while* guaranteeing religious freedom to oppose or refuse to participate in such behavior
If that's true, then I'm afraid you're out of luck. Since I don't believe that homosexuality is wrong, I am naturally not going the want the state to say that it's wrong. And if that means that your sentiments get offended, then I can't help that.
Of course, I don't really believe that is true, and I think there is room enough in this world for both gay people and for conservative Catholics to live by their own lights. I don't agree with Quaker pacifists about the morality of war, but I think we should have a place in this world for Quaker pacifists. I don't agree with Buddhist vegetarians, but there needs to be a place in this world for Buddhist vegetarians. Same goes for you and Erin.
Seriously, Quakers aren't required to participate in wars, and they wouldn't be even if we still had a draft; similarly, why don't you think there can be same protections for you?
The state not saying it's wrong is different from the state sanctioning and blessing it as marriage. Like I said, you can oppose laws against sodomy (for practical reasons)and still be against state's re-definition of marriage.
I believe the Quakers get away with what they get away with, because they are so minor and so invisible. Nobody feels threatened by them. I don't know how long that will last--already there are ridiculous things happening like Amish families being lined up against a wall by gunpoint in the middle of the night for the suspected crime of shipping raw milk over state lines--without much public outcry. It's a relatively minor matter, but folks are conditioned to think that it really is okay for the state to tell people they can't sell or even share raw milk, or maybe even give it to their own children. We're shrugging off these minor freedoms being taken away, but don't tell me the founding fathers aren't turning in their graves over such things. Already, in my lovely state of CA, K-12 is now *required* to include "gay" history in its textbooks, and to present it in a positive light--if you think that isn't going to result in a tension that's got to give, well, enjoy those good feelings while you can.
Re: It's a relatively minor matter, but folks are conditioned to think that it really is okay for the state to tell people they can't sell or even share raw milk, or maybe even give it to their own children
People get sick and die from raw milk routinely, which is why it's an excellent idea to prohibit it. I don't drink milk or eat much milk products, but if I did, I certainly wouldn't drink raw milk, nor would I allow my future children to drink it.
I can't shed too many tears over those medically irresponsible Amish farmers (and I'm not a big follower of the cult of the founding fathers, so that line of argument is a nonstarter).
Well, the bare facts are that pasteurized milk has proved to be far more dangerous than raw milk, despite what the CDC in bed with big dairy farmers *want* us to believe, but I'll let you do the research if you are interested. What about raw veggies, Hector? Shouldn't we be required by law to cook all our veggies; people die from raw veggie contamination all the time. The government should take care of us and ban lettuce, because we can't make that judgment for ourselves. I can't believe I'm in an argument about this on this thread--but I guess you're illustrating what I'm talking about; you have no problem with the government babysitting us through the smallest details, and as long as we're used to that, the government can tell us what we must teach our children, and so on, because someone has to keep us safe from ourselves. Our gradual acceptance of Big Government is a factor here but I want to re-state that my basic point is that when something is blessed and sanctioned by the state, there is no question that religious liberty in that arena will be compromised or even destroyed completely.
The "cult" of the founding fathers--what do you mean??? I happen to think that when we are considering how to run our country, we should have some care about the Constitution. In what way is that a "cult"? If citizens, who are supposed in some measure to be self-ruling, are ignorant about their own country's constitution, and their own rights, how is this not all going to end up being the rule of the few strong and powerful?
My whole point is that the Amish/Quakers etc. aren't necessarily free to do as they wish, even if it is important to them and something they have been doing for hundreds of years, especially if it threatens anyone powerful, and we may see their freedom disappearing.
I thought I was illustrating something which would be obvious and had no intention of dwelling on it...I'll just shut up now...
Rebecca, if you want to conduct business with the public, you have to treat all the public the same, regardless how you feel about them. You can't pick and choose, at least not in the U.S.
If you say "no shirt, no shoes, no service", you can't hold some people to that standard and not others.
If you offer weddings or wedding receptions, you can't serve gays and Lutherans but not Catholics, no matter what your reasons for wanting to do so. Before gay weddings were legally recognized to be the same as any other wedding, responding "in your dreams" to someone wanting you to host a gay wedding reception was perfectly legal. After gay weddings became legal, refusing to host gay wedding receptions while hosting other wedding receptions became as illegal as refusing to host Catholic wedding receptions while hosting other wedding receptions. How either party might feel about either is completely irrelevant under the law. Now, no one can FORCE you to hold wedding receptions if that might mean you might encounter having to hold a gay wedding reception, and that's what the Vermont innkeepers decided to do. Moral for them and legal for everybody.
Maybe you're just not that familiar with anti-Catholic discrimination and persecution, not the kind Red wants to claim, but real persecution. Rebecca being lynched and burned alongside a black by the KKK just because she's Catholic. The only thing stopping that is the same legal arguments you're griping about.
If you want to take things as far as Red wants to take them, then you have to be willing to go the distance she is willing to go and to pay the price she is willing to pay, namely live in self-created all Catholic ghettos. If you want to go farther and make all people obey your moral teachings, you really do need to go farther, out of the U.S., where you can reshape some other country so that Catholic teachings and the laws of the land are one and the same. For those that committed, this isn't as impossible as it may seem.
What you can't do, though, no matter how much you fume about it, is live under the protection of U.S. laws preventing others from discriminating against you because you are Catholic while discriminating against others yourself. Split all the blog hairs you want, it isn't going to happen.
Red's Catholic ghetto idea may be the best solution for you, if you can figure out how to do it without discriminating against others, because it lets you keep U.S. constitutional and other legal protections in place among yourselves. Once you move to the Nation of Catholica, it will be all Catholica, all the time. All the time. Of course, the bishops can, I understand, grant dispensations to some and not to others as they think best, depending, but hopefully you'll be okay with that.
So Glen, I'm with you on thinking that once marriage is redefined by law, it becomes very difficult to maintain the "religious freedom" exemption. What I was saying was, before gay "marriage" was recognized, the B & B folks were fine as long as they said they hosted *wedding* receptions rather than *shacking up* receptions. So I have two questions for you, Glen, and I really want to know what you think; they are not rhetorical questions.
First: Are there *any* behaviors you think it would be okay to protest against. Like for instance, would it be okay for the B and B to refuse to host a reception of a man marrying two or three women? And what role would the law have to do with that--in other words, would it be okay if it were illegal but not okay if it became legal to marry more than one wife. I'm interested in your thoughts on that.
Second question, having to do with your analogy to the KKK burning folks. So I am against people using dangerous drugs, and I support warning people about those drugs, educating youth, and encouraging and helping people on drugs to get off of them. Do you think, because of that, that I secretly would like to burn drug users in religious ceremonies, and that when society disapproves of using dangerous drugs, we are on the verge of violent persecution of drug users? If not, can you explain to me why you think the fact that I think people destroy themselves and society through homosexual behavior, makes me like unto the KKK. I need to have that explained to me. Thanks!
@Rebecca,
Sure. Second question first. You said "If not, can you explain to me why you think the fact that I think people destroy themselves and society through homosexual behavior, makes me like unto the KKK." I didn't say anything of the sort and frankly I don't care what you think about homosexual behavior one way or another. I didn't give an analogy, I gave a historical reference about REAL Catholic discrimination and persecution, about what really could have happened to you personally if you'd been at the wrong place at the wrong time historically and what legally prevents it from happening today. Why, for example, you can't be refused service for being Catholic or be thrown out of a restaurant for acting "Catholicky" ie for saying grace and making the sign of the Cross before eating. You can process that information however you like, take it as I gave it to you, or rearrange it in your mind to suit whatever you want.
First question: it's "okay" to protest against ANY behavior. There are, however, legal consequences to violating laws of the land, at least if you're caught. If you aren't prepared to suffer the consequences, you might not want to violate the laws. Some do. The Vermont innkeepers decided they didn't want to. Or change the laws. Does that help?
Yes, Glen, it helps. Thanks for clarifying what you meant by the KKK stuff and my apologies for not catching your drift (I had some children crawling on me and should have probably just waited and re-read.) Yeah, I'm glad there isn't open violent persecution of Christians or of people who are trying to live according to natural law, yet, in this country. I'm very thankful for that. I'm so glad to live in a free country, and I hope it stays that way. I hope, with all my heart, that California's law about teaching "gay" history will not eventually translate to private schools being required to do the same, or children being taken from their parents, as is now happening in Germany.
On the first question, sure, I think I'm in agreement with you, and I'm for changing the laws. My position is this: once there is a really bad law made which normalizes bad behavior, it is pretty much impossible to maintain or establish conscience clauses and the like. I would think a case like this could in theory set a precedent for a conscience clause, since you can see that serving someone who lives a lifestyle you may disapprove of is vastly different from actively helping that person to celebrate that lifestyle per se. Because of this I do not think the Vermont couple was in outright violation of the law, but again, once something is officially declared decent and good, it *will* become considered indecent to disapprove or protest in any way.
I'm wondering something now...those of you who think the B & B was really violating law: If there was a center which hosted conferences of various sorts, would that center have the right to refuse to host conferences which didn't accord with the views of the people who own it? Like, if they were Democrats, and the conferences tended to be about saving the rainforests and AIDS in Africa, would they be required by law to host a conference with Rush Limbaugh as the main speaker?
Re: I'm wondering something now...those of you who think the B & B was really violating law
I don't think the B & B was violating the law, as I think I made clear. They should have the right to opt out of behaviour they disapprove of. I don't agree that their views that homosexuality is a sin, though, and I don't see why I should be obligated to, or why homosexual couples should be subject to official state disapproval.
Re: My position is this: once there is a really bad law made which normalizes bad behavior, it is pretty much impossible to maintain or establish conscience clauses and the like.
You haven't established, though, that gay sex is 'bad behavior'. It's no more intrinsically immoral that straight sex. I respect that your church thinks otherwise, but that's not a reason for me, or anyone else who isn't RC, to agree with you.
Hector, I wasn't trying to establish that gay sex is bad behavior...and my question about the conference center was addressed to Glen and others who think the Vermont couple broke the law.
The state has no position to say that an act is moral or immoral. A state does have position, in matters not constitutionally reserved to private individual decision, to say that an act is not acceptable in civil society. Voters and legislators may well be motivated by their respective moral codes in deciding when "there oughta be a law against it."
So, the fact that the state refrains, or is restrained, from criminalizing a given act, even the fact that the state formally recognizes and licenses a given human relationship, has no impact at all on whether some churches teach that it is sinful. It is legal to drink alcohol. Muslims and some Protestant sects remain free to teach that to do so is a sin. Nobody accuses them of anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, anti-other-Protestant, or anti-atheist bigotry.
I'm sure I said this before, but just because an act is legal does not mean it is mandatory. Just because the state approves, does not mean every person has to approve, or facilitate. Animal sacrifices to the orishas by the Santeria is constitutionally protected. It does not mean that I have to sell them animals to be used in the sacrifice, nor that I have to permit them to conduct services involving human sacrifice on my premises.
Government imprimatur of approval does not automatically mean that all businesses, or even all public accommodations, must offer or host what is approved.
I thnk you meant "conduct animal sacrifices." I'm pretty sure human sacrifice is banned, even for religious reasons, at least for sacrifice of post-partum humans.
c matt, please point out where I referred to human sacrifice. All I can find is "Animal sacrifices to the orishas by the Santeria is constitutionally protected."
I have often pointed out that, just because some pagan revival wants to indulge in human sacrifice, the First Amendment does NOT protect their right to do so as the free exercise of religion. There is a viewpoint-neutral, generally applicable, law against homicide. (The law does not recognize the pre-partum condition as a person.)
IF Hialeah Florida banned ALL killing of animals for ANY reason, then that generally applicable law would apply to the Santeria. It was the fact that the ordinance exempted every conceivable reason for killing animals EXCEPT religious ritual that betrayed the real purpose, denying free exercise to a given sect.
(The arguments in the city council were laughable... especially the statement that "the Bible does not allow" animal sacrifice in worship.)

A Very Merry Christmas In NY Indeed- Mark Teixeira to the Yankees
_1<<
I would much rather have Varitex then Lowe because what about Clay?
Bigpapi72,
Elizabeth – you and I are true believers in Mikey! And please tell Dr. Neel that Mike is only 34 years old. Have a wonderful Christmas! And remember, next season when Mike has a fantastic year you and I can say – I told you so!
Julia
Merry Christmas! Looks like Lowell is going to stay now. Glad your wish came true.
Great Q&A, Elizabeth! It was fun following your conversation. And I’m glad things worked out the way you wanted them to. I can certainly understand why Lowell’s a favorite of yours. Now if the Red Sox sign Varitek, you’ll be really happy, right? Merry Christmas to you and your family.
-
I’m glad to hear you got your wish, too. I think the nice bushy beard makes Lowell look older.
Merry Christmas!!!
“Happy” Holidays, Elizabeth.
Hi, Elizabeth …
Well, with the Mark Teixeira signing by the Yankees, it will make the “Yankees – Red Sox” rivalry much more fun to watch in 2009 and future years … But, it is a long season, and we all can look forward to a great battle in the AL East between the Yankees, Red Sox, and Rays … Elizabeth, enjoy your Christmas Day; and, Best Wishes, to you and your family, for a Very Christmas and Very Happy Holiday Season !!! … Jimmy [27NYY]
Merry Christmas, Elizabeth
Merry Christmas! It has been so much fun reading your blog over the last few months! I hope you had a great one!
I hope that you had a Merry X’mas. You know what, it’s all good that Mark Texieria signed with the Yankees, I think that Lars Anderson will be ready to unleash hell in a couple of years, can’t wait for that. Also, the Red Sox organization needs to focus on signing ‘Tek, and work on long-term deals with Youk, Jason Bay, and Jonathon Paplebon.
The Yankees’ offseason FA payroll is ridiculous. I’m hoping it’s a sign that the economy may not be as bad as everyone thinks, instead of an idiotic move by the Yanks.
I also hope we don’t receive word of the Yankees letting go of some front office help because they can’t afford to pay them. That’s just couldn’t tell if the streaker was a man or a woman because it had a bag on it’s head.

There were about thirty-five in attendance at the dance given Saturday evening by Mr. and Mrs. John Ferguson and a very pleasant time is reported. Mrs. Gates and niece, Miss Ethel Tuey and Mr. and Mrs. John Dorman and boys were callers at Hillman Saturdeiy. One married young lady in our neighborhood ought to have a prize for early rising as well as kind deeds to her neighbors. One morning last week she got breakfast for her "gude man" and herself and did up morning work, then went to her nearest neighbor and finding them still asleep, built a fire in the kitchen stove to make it warm and nice for them. We call that real goodness of heart these cold mornings. Miss Pleasant Loop spent a few clays at home the latter part of last week, returning Saturday, just in time to take in the dance. We understand that there is considerable opposition all along the line to the new star route proposed from Hillman— the majority preferring the present route from Pierz to having their mail changed. Matt Pint went to Sullivan again Monday to resume his work of making posts. Miss Pleasant Loop returned to the Pint hom^ on Monday. Tracy Waller went to Lastrup Monday. Was Found Not Guilty. Eugene Tuft, the young man, in a fight with whom Leo Webber lost his life last fall, was found not guilty. The fact remains that Webber and Tuft fought and that Webber died from the effects of a wound received during the fight. The wound was made with an instrument which might have been a screw-driver. A screw-driver was found where the tight occurred. Pretty good circumstantial evidence. Yet the jury found him not guilty. According to that, you cannot convict a man for shooting another, by eye witness' testimony, because they didn't see tbe bullet. The St. Cloud Times says: "There is a growing belief that Leo Webber was not killed. The jury is responsible for this rumor. There are few greater uncertainties in life than a jury."

The United States Civil Service Commission has announced an examination for the county of Morrison, Minnesota, to be held at Little Falls, on February 24th, 1917, to fill the position of rural carrier at Hillman and Bowlus, and vacancies that may later occur on rural routes from other post offices in the above mentioned county. The examination will be open only to male citizens who are actually domiciled in the territory of a post office in the county and who meet the other requirements set forth in Form No. 1977. This form and application blanks may be obtained from the offices mentioned above or from the United States Civil Service Commission at Washington, D. C. Applications should be forwarded to the Commission at Washington at the earliest practicable date. Warning to R. F. 0. Patrons. The R. F.

Such sections will be cut out, they say, if conditions are not remedied. At their request, the Journal publishes the following articles bearing on this phase of the service from Postal Laws and Regulations: Roads on which rural-delivery service is established shall be in good condition and so main- t ained. unobstructed by gates, and there shall be no unbridged streams not ford able at all seasons of the year. Each box should be erected on the road regularly traveled by a rural mail carrier and such position as to be easily and safely accessible tor the delivery and collection of mail by the carrier without leiiying his conveyance. Patrons should keep clear the approaches to their boxes by prompt reinovel of snowdrifts or other obstructions by which the delivery of mail into them would be rendered impossible or difficult without the carrier leaving his conveyance.

It is estimated that 17 inches of snow fell and as the storm was accompanied by a high wind, the snow was piled in high drifts, making traveling in the rural sections almost impossible. Following tbe storm the thermometer took a sudden plunge downward and Monday morning at 8 o'clock 20 below zeso was registered. The church attendance was very light Sunday morning. Peter Meyer Had A Close Call While talking about guns, hounds, wolves and about hunting in general, Peter Meyer, the blacksmith, dropped into a reminiscent mood and told this story: "A number of years ago while working in a lumber camp, 12 miles east, I was sent to town one evening on an errand. I did not start on the return trip until about 10 o'clock- The night was dark and a fairly stiff northwest wind urged me into a brisk walk, which was sometimes quickened into a run, to keep me warm. After crossing Hillman creek, near the present site of the bridge, a wolf's long howl from across Tomala's hill broke the silence of the night. This gave me no little uneasiness as the dismal and blood-curling howl was almost straight ahead. After examining my rifle to see that the repeater was in working order, I decided not to turn back. Presently another wolf gave signal by a shrill howl close behind me. I kept up a dog-trot for the next mile or two. By that time no less than about 25 wolves were in signal communication with one another all around me. They seemed to work in a circle and coming closer. When about a mile from the, camp, where the road lead through a ravine and where overhanging boughs made it doubly dark and ominous, I could hear the wolves cracking the underbrush as they crouched around preparing for an attack. The odds were heavily against me, but being so close to the camp, I hazarded a shot in the direction of the closest one. The report of the gun had a magical effect, for their feast song came to an end before the reverberation of the shot had died away among the pines. That ended their howls for that night. What would have happened if the camp had been a mile further away, I do not know. It is more than likely however that I should not now be here to hammer an anvil chorus, or relate this tale." The creamery well is still uncertain of its fate. Dynamite has been used in large quantities to dislodge the obstructions in the casings, but without results. The prevailing opinion is that digging a new well is the only remedy for the existing trouble. Local Happenings Ofjhe Week. Poor roads.

The jurors who came home Saturday night for an over Sunday visit were in a dilemma Monday morning. When they left the county seat Saturday under promise that they would return for service Monday, the storm was 'not taken into account. However, when the auto bus failed to show up Monday morning, they scurried a- round and found someone to drive them in. It is hoped that a lenient judge did not fine them for contempt of court. Two Singular Cases In Which Slea$ Warnings Came True. "I dreamed that the ship was in' a heavy sea, that a big wave came over her bows, pressed down upon her, and then she rolled over on her starboard side and disappeared." This is not an extract fr-dta a story. It is evidence, given on oath, during the inquiry at London into the mysterious disappearance of the Waratah, the vessel which, on her second voyage mysteriously disappeared in, July, 1909, and has never been heard of since. And so impressed was the passenger with the vision that he left the vessel at Durban, from which point she continued on her ill fated voyage. Thus one more was added to the extraordinary coincidences in which dreams have figured. The third Lord Waterford was able to verify a story of an extraor- fiinary dream coming true. Talking one day with the landlord of the inn in the village close to Curragh- more, a man rushed up and said there had been a murder on the hills. "Then it must he the little one," said the landlord, at which Lord Waterford, not unnaturally, became very suspicious. The laud- lord proceeded to explain that in the night he dreamed that two men had come to the inn and that the taller of the two had murdered the shorter with a very curious knife. He told his dream to his .wife, who laughed at him. But, to his horror, the men he had seen while asleep came to the inn, and one used the curious knife to cut up his food. They left, and soon afterward news of the murder arrived. Search was made for a tall man answering to the landlord's description, and one was quickly arrested. In prison he confessed he had murdered his short companion.—Pearson's Weekly. Humbug. The word "humbug" had its origin as follows: Among the many issues of base coin made from time to time in Ireland there was none so worthless as that made by James II. at the Dublin mint. It was made of whatever metal was the easiest to get, lead, copper, pewter or brass, and so low was its intrinsic value that 20 shillings of it v.as worth only twopence sterling. The soft mixed metal of which that worthless coin was composed was known to the Irish as "uimbog," pronounced oombog, meaning soft copper or worthless money. Thus the phrase 'Tiumbug" originated by a person saying: "That is a piece of uim-bog." "Don't try to pass off your uim-bog on me."—Exchange. A Big Difference. From the parlor there came a crash that brought the careful housekeeper downstairs at unusual speed. "Sarah," she said, "did you break something?" "Yes, ma'am." "What was it?" "One of those green vases, ma'am. But it only broke in two pieces." "You stupid girl," said the careful housekeeper. "It is gone, so what difference does it make whether it is in two pieces or two hundred ?" "All the difference in the world, ma'am, as you would soon find out if you had to pick up the pieces," said Sarah.—Exchange. When Love Got a Chill. "Chrissie and me have had a row," said the young man, murdering grammar in the intensity of his grief. "Why, what's up ?"

The 2006 release of Mishkan T'filah--A Reform Siddur marks a historic turning: from exclusive rabbinic authorship to broad involvement of Reform Jews throughout North America; from linear to open services; and much more. To better understand this innovative prayer book, Reform Judaism editor Aron Hirt-Manheimer interviewed Rabbi Lawrence Hoffman, the Barbara and Stephen Friedman Professor of Liturgy, Worship, and Ritual at HUC-JIR, who served on the planning committees for both the new prayer book and its predecessor, Gates of Prayer.
You have been involved in developing Reform prayer books for some time. Has the process changed?
Yes. Creating the Reform Movement's newest prayer book, Mishkan T'filah (2006), was a far more thorough, lengthy, and democratic process than ever before. We began with an extensive survey of our congregations, funded by an Eli Lilly grant and organized by Rabbi Peter Knobel and Dan Schechter. A preliminary committee then responded with recommendations to the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), after which several potential editors submitted proposals as to how best to crystallize these recommendations in practice. Then an editorial committee consisting of lay leaders, rabbis, cantors, and liturgists discussed every issue in detail, while field-testing each siddur draft at Union for Reform Judaism biennials and CCAR conventions and in nearly 300 congregations throughout North America. We also received hundreds of additional comments from lay people, rabbis, and cantors--and we listened to every suggestion. At the end, a publishing committee composed of Rabbis Peter Knobel, Bernard Mehlman, Elliot Stevens, Elaine Zecher, prayer book editor Elyse Frishman, Debbie Smilow, and me oversaw the final document, discussing global issues not yet settled, attending to prayer book design, guaranteeing true translations rather than paraphrases, and reviewing English alternatives--sometimes replacing them, sometimes supplementing them in consultation with specialists in Jewish literature, poetry, linguistics, and liturgy. Talk about inclusivity! Each stage of the process factored in issues of gender, age, theology, generation, academic expertise, and style--the intangible issue of how people like to pray. This is truly a prayer book by and for the people.
With all this input, Rabbi Elyse Frishman conceived of a brilliant layout device whereby every facing two-page spread would contain a traditional prayer (with translation and transliteration) on the right, and alternative English readings on that prayer's theme on the left. Any given facing page might include (besides the traditional offering) a feminist voice, a classical Reform perspective, advocacy for social justice, personal reflections, and so forth.
The result is a set of double-page spreads with contents that vary enormously in register and in rhetoric. Some worshipers appreciate evocative poetry; others are drawn to prayers with evident cognitive or philosophical messages. Every double page has enough variety to allow each individual worshiper to find a "home" there. People may recite or sing along with the larger community in whatever options the prayer leader chooses, or elect instead to meditate on an alternative passage. But the left- and the right-side pages always conclude with the same traditional Hebrew line, which is called the chatimah. So when you get to that line, no matter what you're reading, you know to turn the page and keep up with the service.
What does the making of Mishkan T'filah tell us about the times we live in?
I like to link prayer books to economic history. Throughout the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, our economy was primarily industrial, with standardized goods (like the Model T Ford) made in factories. The mirror liturgical image was the 1895 Union Prayer Book, which standardized prayer with little regard for the individual worshiper. In that classical mode of prayer, Reform worship rarely varied. Wherever you went--New York, Chicago or Muncie, Indiana--Reform rabbis stood at the front and read at everyone else. Long paragraphs were given to the rabbi; the congregation got one-line responsive readings. But how much individuality can you express if all you get is a one-liner?
After World War II, we entered a service economy, where people expected to be served in a customized manner. Many Jews eventually stopped attending synagogue regularly, but came reliably for life-cycle events, which they treated as customized services. When they no longer felt the need for synagogue services, they quit.
Today we inhabit what's called an experience economy. Consumers shop at malls not just to buy what they want, but to have a buying "experience"--greeters at the door, music in the background, and other kinds of entertainment.
Gates of Prayer expressed a service economy. It offered ten different service selections to satisfy individualized theological tastes, but only one could be used at any given Shabbat prayer experience. Mishkan T'filah, too, provides options, but it does so on each page, not in separate services. On any double-page spread, individual voices on the left-hand page personalize the experience, while the traditional text on the right-hand page creates a community of worshipers. So Mishkan T'filah provides for a communal experience while allowing for individuality in prayer.
As part of the experience economy, Mishkan T'filah is less text than pretext for a worship experience where the act of prayer matters more than the fixed words it uses. No siddur of the past understood that prayer books are not so much books as they are scripts for the experience of worship.
The full title of the new prayer book is Mishkan T'filah--A Reform Siddur. Why was "Reform" added to the title of a CCAR prayer book for the first time?
We debated the English title at some length. Some people preferred Siddur for Prayer, but we elected to affirm this prayer book as Reform, even though we believe any Jew could use it. By using "Siddur" in the title instead of just "Reform Prayer Book," we are making the statement that our Movement is comfortable with the age-old vocabulary of our people. The word "Reform" modifies that language with a recognition that Reform Judaism has a point of view and, having been practiced for almost 200 years, is itself a valid tradition.
When you say that the new siddur reflects the Reform "point of view," what viewpoints come to mind?
The siddur reflects our Movement's historical commitment to the vernacular (not just the original Hebrew or Aramaic), to originating new prayers that address new times, to a theology that we can take seriously, to elevated aesthetics (especially music)--and, in more recent times, to egalitarianism.
But I want to emphasize two other aspects of Mishkan T'filah. The first is its integrity regarding content. We didn't include some traditionalist prayers that, in all good conscience, Reform Jews cannot say. For example, in traditionalist siddurim, the Shema includes not just the Shema Yisrael and V'ahavta, but two more paragraphs which American Reform prayer books have omitted ever since the 1890s. With the trend toward recapturing abandoned traditions, we were urged to reinstate the last two paragraphs. But the third paragraph links Divine reward and punishment to human merit and sin--an implicit suggestion that sickness or suffering may be God's retaliation, something Reform Jews reject. So Mishkan T'filah continues the Reform tradition of omitting this paragraph, even as we have readopted the second paragraph.
Second, Mishkan T'filah values inclusivity. Reform Jews like to ask "Who's in?," not "Who's out?" We know, for example, that some people have doubts about God. So, hoping to welcome them "in," we offer prayer and poetry that speak to the human condition without referencing God. We also include voices from classical Reform thought--like those of Leo Baeck and Lily Montague.
How does Mishkan T'filah's design and layout differ from previous Reform prayer books?
The aesthetic has changed. In addition to adding a second color (blue), each page has been uniquely designed. The best example is the Shema. To express visually our belief in the Shema as the central doctrine of our faith, the Hebrew text of that single line, Shema Yisra'el..., is enlarged and stretched across both pages. You look at it and say, "This is really central."
Also, Mishkan T'filah addresses questions Reform worshipers may have about the prayers they're reading. So at the bottom of the page, we provide historical and spiritual interpretations of the liturgy, as well as explanations of traditional body movements associated with particular prayers--not behavioral dictates but alternatives that derive from tradition.
Another unique design feature lets worshipers know where they are in the order of the service. The margins of each page list the sequence of prayers with the name of the prayer at hand highlighted typographically. Ritual depends on familiarity with structure--bringing in a birthday cake "works," for example, because everyone knows the candles will be blown out afterward. In prayer, too, knowing the flow of the service enhances every moment of it.
How do these innovations change the rabbi and cantor's role in the service?
People no longer want to be "talked to" or "sung at." So service leaders will have to work at engaging worshipers, especially in the music. Also, it will take some time for rabbis and cantors to get used to selecting from options on each double page. Prayer leaders will now need to prepare for the service in advance as a worship team, rather than walking independently onto the pulpit to read lines or sing music. Mishkan T'filah does include one linear Shabbat service for those more comfortable with the Gates of Prayer approach, but we expect that linear services will be used less and less as people are increasingly drawn to the spiritual possibilities of services framed around choices on facing pages.
How does the new prayer book reflect our Movement's commitment to social justice?
Gates of Prayer, published in 1975, appeared at a time of heightened fear for Israel's survival and concern for the plight of Soviet Jews. So it tilted toward particularism. Mishkan T'filah remains fiercely proud of peoplehood, but it reasserts what classical Reform Jews called "the mission of Israel," which is the whole point of peoplehood: to be engaged with God in transforming society. It thereby marks a return to a universalistic call to social justice. And while Gates of Prayer had a single service that focused on social justice--you could go to synagogue your whole life without ever encountering it--Mishkan T'filah has prayers for social justice everywhere. The Jewish prayer experience should not only evoke a Jewish response to God, but also a Jewish response to bettering God's world. If cries from without are not heard within, prayers from within are not heard on high.
Does this siddur address the issue of masculine and feminine God language in a way that is likely to resonate with 21st century Reform Jews?
Yes, I think so. Our goal was not to describe God as male or female, but to use evocative language that lends the possibility of seeing God as either, or as both. We address God, for example, as "Teacher of Torah"; we plead with God to "help us be sensitive." Implicitly, then, God appears as both male and female, but explicitly the language is universal.
How does this translation differ from those of our previous prayer books?
Some Reform prayer books were exact translations of the Hebrew. In the 1850s, for example, our Movement's founder, Isaac Mayer Wise, wrote Minhag America. If he wanted to say something in English, he changed the Hebrew to accord with it. In Gates of Prayer, some passages were exact translations but others were not. Mishkan T'filah returned to Wise's standard of exact translations on every right-hand page, relegating creative expressions of the prayer's theme to the opposite page.
Transliteration of all the Hebrew is also provided on every page--another innovation?
Yes. The Union Prayer Book contained no transliteration at all. In Gates of Prayer, transliteration could only be found at the back of the book. Nowadays, while we as a Movement have increasingly advocated Hebrew literacy in recognition of Hebrew as our people's historic language, we have also urged that prayer be open also to people who cannot read the original. If Mishkan T'filah is a prayer book for all the people, then we shouldn't lock out those who can't read Hebrew.
A minority of rabbis opposed our decision to transliterate all the Hebrew in Mishkan T'filah, believing it will be a disincentive for Jews to learn Hebrew. In respectful response to them (though disagreeing with them), our committee decided to publish an alternative siddur version without transliteration.
The Union Prayer Book opened only from left to right. Gates of Prayer came in two versions, one opening from right to left and one from left to right. Why does the new prayer book open only from right to left?
While proudly universalistic, Mishkan T'filah reflects the growing importance of Hebrew and commitment to Am Yisrael (Jewish peoplehood) in our Movement; therefore, it opens in the traditional manner of a Hebrew book, from right to left.
How important is it to our Movement that a single prayer book becomes widely adopted by Reform congregations?
It's very important. Some people think that we live in a post-denominational age--that denominations just don't matter anymore. I disagree. More than ever, in this age of choice, Jews have to decide what kind of Jews they are. People who say they are "just Jewish" have not yet processed their Judaism beyond its bare essentials. Mature and full Jewish identity requires choices, and choices imply denominations. And the prayer book is the gateway to Jewish identity; more than anything else, how we pray defines what kind of Jew we are. I grew up in an Orthodox shul, and while I can still appreciate traditionalist services, I find the Orthodox prayer book unreflective of the Jew I have chosen to be. I chose Reform Judaism because of what it stands for, and we as a Movement have to make that message clear to ourselves and to others. If we have a plethora of prayer books, we will end up with a plethora of definitions of what Reform Judaism stands for; and although it is true that Reform encompasses a great variety of things, it is also true that if we are all things, we are nothing. Mishkan T'filah encourages individualism, but defines the community in which that individualism is possible. If you regularly attend the service and someone asks you, "What makes you a Reform Jew?," you'll be able to answer the question.
Had Isaac Mayer Wise been one of the readers during the market research phase of Mishkan T'filah, what do you think he would have told the committee?
Isaac Mayer Wise was a remarkable leader because he respected change. When his Minhag America was rejected as the basis for the Union Prayer Book, he accepted the fact that his prayer book had been intended for Jews of the 1850s and '60s, but not the 1890s. Wise would have applauded Mishkan T'filah as the proper expression of Jewish identity not for the 1890s and not even for the 1990s, but for the 2000s and beyond.
"Entering the Tent"
To assist congregations in making the transition to Mishkan T'filah (MT), the Joint Commission on Worship, Music and Religious Living (a partnership of the American Conference of Cantors, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and the Union for Reform Judaism) has created a website,, which covers the following topics:
I. Understanding Mishkan T'filah
II. Leading Worship with Mishkan T'filah
<|endofexample|>
The conversation with my daughter went like this; "Mom, does God yell at me?" I replied quizzically, "No, why?" She lamented, "Well, sometimes I hear yelling in my head to do something. I was wondering if that is how God talks to me." I strongly added, "Sweetheart, God absolutely does not yell. He will make things uncomfortable for us to draw us back to Him when we stray but He does not force or yell."
It would be good to remember this through our study of Isaiah. I often want to read this as God yelling, but He does not. In fact God's character is best seen through Christ. Hebrews 1:3a states this about God's character, " He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature." God the Father is the exact imprint of Christ's nature. When we look at Christ in the Scriptures it is the best picture we get of the Father. What love, grace, and truth we should see. The Father, Son, and Spirit are One. And in our day we are blessed to have the Spirit live in us if we are believing by Faith what Christ did for us. What a great view we have in studying Isaiah.
Isaiah is so timely for addressing the days we currently live in. The children of Israel were being disciplined for straying from God. He was supposed to be supreme in their lives. He loves them so much that He will discipline them as far as He must for them to return to Him.
During the time period of this book we observe that God not only sent Isaiah but He continued to speak through many other prophets, sending them to warn of impending judgement. As much as a loving Father desires for His children to listen and turn away from sin, He loves them more so to follow through with discipline if they chose to forsake Him and His teachings. His love is too great to let them continue waywardly.
We will learn much about God's character. He loves so deeply and richly that He cannot just turn His head from our sin. God is complete holiness and sinless, He cannot have sin in His presence. So in the days of the cross He sent Jesus to take our sin upon Himself making us clean in God's eyes once we accept Christ's sacrifice. Signs of Christ are all over the book of Isaiah. It is beautiful to discover. Though we deserve judgement and wrath God was pleased to send Jesus to restore our relationship by taking the wrath upon Himself.
We see the prophet Isaiah pointing us to Christ and though God seems harsh in judgement we must know He is only being a loving Father, and/or a Faithful Husband to His people.
In Isaiah 1-5 we see it as God bringing forth His judgement on His people. It is like a trial but the jury is the Heavens and the earth (v.2). God is declaring His people as sick with sin. They are worshiping God with the motions but do not mean it in their hearts. God can see directly in our hearts.
I wonder if we are ever guilty of this kind of worship?
God calls them to repentance. to go back to doing what is right. He then tells us about the coming Messiah. In Chapter 1, v. 18 we see this pointing, "though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool." They did not know this then but we know it now this is talking about Christ who takes the stain of our sins away when we trust in Him as our Savior.
God then tells His people that this judgement comes with a cleansing purpose. What grace it is when God loves us this much to not let us get away with sin. He draws us back through trials. He doesn't force our hand in choosing Him but woos us back through trial. That is what He was doing with His people.
In chapter two the word talks about in the last days how God will reign. There will be peace and no more war. Those who are prideful will be brought low. There is only room for ONE to be exalted.
Chapter three discusses how since God's people would not listen God is taking away all of their security and support. His men and women will lose protection. There will be no good leaders. These people are sinning and are proud of it (v.9). Yet v. 8 tells us they brought this sin on themselves "because their speech and deeds are against the Lord, defying His glorious presence."
Chapter four gives us some hope again, it talks about the day "the branch of the Lord" which refers to Jesus, will be beautiful and glorious. How God does leave a remnant of His people because He is faithful to His promises not to wipe them all out. It ends with God protecting them.
Chapter five is a sad chapter that starts with a parable to explain what they have done to God. Then ends with many woes lamenting their many sins. It ends with God summoning the nations that will take them captive because of their refusal to turn from their sins.
Yet the next section we study we will see that though His wrath is great, His grace is greater still.
Things to think about:
Can you see the amazing heart of God through this?
What do you learn about God's character?
Would you say that God is a patiently enduring God?
Has this opened your eyes to seeing God in a new way?
How have you been like a stubborn child? Know that you can always turn in repentance. He is waiting.
What can you learn from these passages that you can apply to your life today?
What similarities can we see that exist in our society today?

MT. VERNON — —
Five Jefferson County students made their Four-Way Test Speech presentations at the noon Mt. Vernon Rotary Club meeting on Tuesday, hoping to advance to District competition.
Students are divided into two levels — novices and competition —the former for those who have had no speech contest experience and the latter for those who have experience or working with a speech team coach.
Four of the five speeches given Tuesday were in the novice division and presented by Makayla Smith of Mt. Vernon Township High School, Shanae Jones of Waltonville HIgh School, Matthew Renaud of Woodlawn High School and Felicia Wagner of Mt. Vernon Township High School. William Box of Mt. Vernon Township High School participated in the competition division. Another MVTHS student in the competition division, Quentin Lloyd, was absent.
Smith based her experiences as a child care worker at Central Christian Church as the basis for her service to community.
"Children can be sweet or they fight among themselves. What do they fight over? Toys, not about the differences between them. We lose the quality of sharing as adults. What happened to sharing? What happened to kindness? Service can be as easy as helping someone who is hurting," she said.
Jones, who works with several groups including the cheerleading squad, Relay for Life and FFA said her cheerleading coach teaches honesty and dedication, which can be carried over to all types of service. She concluded, "Only a life living for someone else can be true service."
Renaud chose to show the differences of The Grinch, someone "nasty and selfish" to Jesus Christ, who passes the four-way test with flying colors. He defined peace as "the intent and sincerity of the heart," adding, "You can't just suggest peace, you have to show it."
Wagner gave examples of those who have shown service to others, specifically naming Mother Teresa and Oprah Winfrey.
"One act of kindness can lead to that person serving someone else," Wagner said. "Everyone has something to give. One act of courage can help someone else. Through service, we can achieve peace."
Finally, Box — without the use of note cards unlike the remaining contestants — described how individuals can find peace through volunteering.
The theme of this year's contest was "Peace Through Service."
Renaud was named the winner in the novice division and Box was named the winner in the competition division, according to club member Kevin Settle. The two will advance to the District competition on April 27 at John A. Logan College in Carterville.
President Carl Miller provided the contestants with parting gifts, and their classroom teachers were recognized.

Alternatively, assuming the event horizon in each slice to be a Strahlkörper in the manner of
Section 2.2, we can define a suitable level-set function
by Equation (7
). Substituting this definition
into Equation (10
) then gives an explicit evolution equation for the horizon shape function,
Surfaces near the event horizon share the same “attraction” property discussed in Section 5.2 for
geodesics near the event horizon. Thus by integrating either surface representation (10
) or (11
)
backwards in time, we can refine an initial guess into a very accurate approximation to the event
horizon.
In contrast to the null geodesic equation (8
), neither Equation (10
) nor Equation (11
) contain any derivatives of the
4-metric (or equivalently the 3 + 1 geometry variables). This makes it much easier to integrate these latter equations
accurately11.
This formulation of the event-horizon finding problem also completely eliminates the tangential-drifting
problem discussed in Section 5.2, since the level-set function only parameterizes motion normal to the
surface.
For a practical algorithm, it is useful to integrate a pair of trial null surfaces backwards: an “inner-bound” one which starts (and thus always remains) inside the event horizon and an “outer-bound” one which starts (and thus always remains) outside the event horizon. If the final slice contains an apparent horizon then any 2-surface inside this can serve as our inner-bound surface. However, choosing an outer-bound surface is more difficult.
It is this desire for a reliable outer bound on the event horizon position that motivates our requirement (Section 4) for the final slice (or at least its strong-field region) to be approximately stationary: In the absence of time-dependent equations of state or external perturbations entering the system, this requirement ensures that, for example, any surface substantially outside the apparent horizon can serve as an outer-bound surface.
Assuming we have an inner- and an outer-bound surface on the final slice, the spacing between these two
surfaces after some period of backwards integration then gives an error bound for the computed event
horizon position. Equivalently, a necessary (and, if there are no other numerical problems, sufficient)
condition for the event-horizon finding algorithm to be accurate is that the backwards integration must have
proceeded far enough for the spacing between the two trial surfaces to be “small”. For a reasonable
definition of “small”, this typically takes at least
of backwards integration, with
or
more providing much higher accuracy.
In some cases it is difficult to obtain a long enough span of numerical data for this backwards integration. For example, in some simulations of binary black hole collisions, the evolution becomes unstable and crashes soon after a common apparent horizon forms. This means that we cannot compute an accurate event horizon for the most interesting region of the spacetime, that which is close to the black-hole merger. There is no good solution to this problem except for the obvious one of developing a stable (or less-unstable) simulation that can be continued for a longer time.
The initial implementations of the “integrate null surface backwards” algorithm by Anninos et al. [7
], Libson et al. [103
],
and Walker [162
] were based on the explicit Strahlkörper surface integration formula (11
), further restricted to
axisymmetry12.
For a single black hole the coordinate choice is straightforward. For the two-black-hole case, the authors
used topologically cylindrical coordinates
, where the two black holes collide along the
axisymmetry (
) axis. Based on the symmetry of the problem, they then assumed that the event horizon
shape could be written in the form
This spacetime’s event horizon has the now-classic “pair of pants” shape, with a non-differentiable cusp
along the “inseam” (the
axis
) where new generators join the surface. The authors tried two
ways of treating this cusp numerically:
Caveny et al. [44
, 46
] implemented the “integrate null surfaces backwards” algorithm for fully generic
numerically-computed spacetimes using the explicit Strahlkörper surface integration formula (11
). To
handle moving black holes, they recentered each black hole’s Strahlkörper parameterization (4
) on the
black hole’s coordinate centroid at each time step.
For single-black-hole test cases (Kerr spacetime in various coordinates), they report typical accuracies of
a few percent in determining the event horizon position and area. For binary-black-hole test cases
(Kastor–Traschen extremal-charge black hole coalescence with a cosmological constant), they detect black
hole coalescence (which appears as a bifurcation in the backwards time integration) by the “necking off” of
the surface. Figure 6
shows an example of their results.
Caveny et al. [44
, 45
] and Diener [60
] (independently) implemented the “integrate null surfaces
backwards” algorithm for fully generic numerically-computed spacetimes, using the level-set
function integration formula (10
). Here the level-set function
is initialized on the final slice
of the evolution and evolved backwards in time using Equation (10
) on (conceptually) the
entire numerical grid. (In practice, only a smaller box containing the event horizon need be
evolved.)
This surface parameterization has the advantage that the event-horizon topology and (non-)smoothness
are completely unconstrained, allowing the numerical study of configurations such as toroidal event
horizons (discussed in Section 4). It is also convenient that the level-set function
is defined on
the same numerical grid as the spacetime geometry, so that no interpolation is needed for the
evolution.
The major problem with this algorithm is that during the backwards evolution,
spatial gradients in
tend to steepen into a jump discontinuity at the event
horizon14,
eventually causing numerical difficulty.
Caveny et al. [44, 45] deal with this problem by adding an artificial viscosity (i.e. diffusion) term to
the level-set function evolution equation, smoothing out the jump discontinuity in
. That is, instead of
Equation (10
), they actually evolve
via
Alternatively, Diener [60
] developed a technique of periodically reinitializing the level-set function to
approximately the signed distance from the event horizon. To do this, he periodically evolves
In various tests on analytical data, Diener [60
] found this event-horizon finder, EHFinder, to be robust
and highly accurate, typically locating the event horizon to much less than 1% of the 3-dimensional grid
spacing. As an example of results obtained with EHFinder, Figure 7
shows two views of the
numerically-computed event horizon for a spiraling binary black hole collision. As another example,
Figure 8
shows the numerically-computed event and apparent horizons in the collapse of a rapidly rotating
neutron star to a Kerr black hole. (The apparent horizons were computed using the AHFinderDirect
code described in Section 8.5.7.)
EHFinder is implemented as a freely available module (“thorn”) in the
Cactus computational toolkit
(see Table 2). It originally worked only with the PUGH unigrid driver, but work is ongoing [61] to enhance
it to work with the
Carpet mesh-refinement driver [134, 131].

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
The school is also dropping its health insurance plan for students because the new health care law requires employers to provide more robust coverage, making it more expensive, said Tom Sofio, a spokesman for the Franciscan University of Steubenville.
“It was our own moral reasons and then the rising cost of health care because of the act,” Sofio said, explaining the university’s decision.
Sofio said school officials are not aware of another college that has dropped its health insurance plan out of disagreements with the federal health care law.
A spokeswoman for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is representing three religious schools that are challenging the health care law, said that she was also unaware of another college that had taken such action.
A spokeswoman with the Health and Human Services Department, charged with implementing the new health care law, said Wednesday that the department had no comment on the school’s decision and that it does not keep track of changes to college health insurance plans.
The Obama administration faced a firestorm of controversy from many religious groups this year over a proposed rule that would require employers to provide no-cost contraception coverage to their employees.
In what it called a compromise, the White House revised the rule to require health insurance companies – not employers – to provide contraception coverage, mollifying some Catholic critics. Other Catholic groups, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, are not satisfied by the revised rule.
The Roman Catholic Church opposes the use of contraception.
“We’re paying the health insurance company, and if they provide abortion-causing drugs, that’s against our religious beliefs,” Sofio said Wednesday.
About 200 of the Franciscan University of Steubenville's 2,500 students rely on the university health care plan, which costs about $50 a month, Sofio said. He said the school is retaining its health care plan for employees because it is hopeful that legal challenges to the health care law will prevent much of it from taking effect.
Sofio said that the school sent letters about its decision to students and parents in April and that it has received overwhelming support from both constituencies. Ninety-five percent of students at the university are Catholic, he said.

James, Brother of Jesus
James brother of Jesus
The following article is excerpted from the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, which is in the public domain.
This James is mentioned by name only twice in the Gospels, i.e. when, on the visit of Jesus to Nazareth, the countrymen of our Lord referred in contemptuous terms to His earthly kindred, in order to disparage His preaching (Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3). As James was one of "his brethren," he was probably among the group of Christ's relatives who sought to interview Him during His tour through Galilee with the Twelve (Matthew 12:46). By the same reasoning, he accompanied Jesus on His journey to Capernaum (John 2:12), and joined in attempting to persuade Him to depart from Galilee for Judea on the eve of the Feast of Tabernacles (John 7:3). At this feast James was present (John 7:10), but was at this time a non-believer in Jesus (compare John 7:5, "Even his brethren did not believe on him")." (Acts 1:14). While there, he probably took part in the election of Matthias to the vacant apostleship (Acts 1:15-25). James was one of the earliest witnesses to the resurrection, for, after the risen Lord had manifested Himself to the five hundred, "he was seen of James" (1 Corinthians 15:7 the King James Version). By this his growing belief and prayerful expectancy received confirmation. About 37 or 38 AD, James, "the Lord's brother" (Galatians 1:19), was still in Jerusalem, and had an interview there for the first time with Paul, when the latter returned from his 3 years' sojourn in Damascus to visit Cephas, or Peter (Galatians 1:18,19; compare Acts (Acts 12:17).
By the time of the Jerusalem convention, i.e. about 51 AD (compare Galatians 2:1), James had reached the position of first overseer in the church (compare Acts 15:13,19). Previous to this date, during Paul's ministry at Antioch, he had dispatched certain men thither to further the mission, and the teaching of these had caused dissension among the newly converted Christians and their leaders (Acts 15:1,2; Galatians 2:12). The conduct of Peter, over whom James seems to have had considerable influence, was the principal matter of contention (compare Galatians 2:11 if). However, at the Jerusalem convention the dispute was amicably settled, and the pillars of the church, James, John and Cephas, gave to Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship (Galatians 2:9).
The speech of James on this occasion (Acts 15:13-29), his sympathy with the religious needs of the Gentileworld (Acts 15:17), his desire that formalism should raise no barrier to their moral and spiritual advancement (Acts 15:19,20,28,29), and his large-hearted tributes to the "beloved Barnabas and Paul" (Acts (Acts 21:17).
At this meeting Paul was admonished for exceeding the orders he had received at the first council, in that he had endeavored to persuade the converted Jews also to neglect circumcision (Acts 21:21), and was commanded to join in the vow of purification (Acts 21:23-26). There is no Scriptural account of the death of James From 1 Corinthians Ac

With an increasing number of reports speculating about the Bahrain Grand Prix, the circuit has just made the following statement:
,” said Shaikh Salman bin Isa Al Khalifa, the circuit’s chief executive. “We are monitoring the situation very closely indeed in association with the relevant authorities, and will respond appropriately to any further developments.”
——————————–
Just two weeks before the Formula One teams arrive to use the Bahrain International Circuit for their last winter testing session, and three and a half weeks before the first race of the season, the Bahrain Grand Prix is in doubt.
Following Tunisia and Egypt, Bahrain is now undergoing mass protests and political upheaval, and one opposition group has even announced that it will target the race in order to gain publicity for its cause. Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One promoter, has told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in England that he is worried.
“The danger is obvious, isn’t it?” Ecclestone said. “If these people wanted to make a fuss and get worldwide recognition, it would be bloody easy, wouldn’t it? You start making a problem on the start grid in Bahrain and it would get worldwide coverage.”
He said he will soon speak to Crown Prince Salman ibn Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa to find out what the situation is like and talk about the race.
But the news wire reports of the situation are becoming more critical by the day.
Autosport.com reported that Nabeel Rajab, vice president of the campaign group Bahrain Center for Human Rights, said that the race was seen as an opportunity for protesters to publicize their cause.
“For sure, F1 is not going to be peaceful this time,” Rajab told Arabian Business, according to Autosport. “There’ll be lots of journalists, a lot of people looking and [the government] will react in a stupid manner as they did today and yesterday. And that will be bloody, but will be more publicized.”
With 20 races in the season this year, eliminating the Bahrain Grand Prix would not make a huge difference to the championship. But it would be a business nightmare – with hotel and travel bookings and all the various sponsorship deals and agreements that surround a race.

Mission
The mission of the Coalition is to renew Growing Greener!
Growing Greener has transformed Pennsylvania by empowering communities to protect working farms and special places, clean up rivers and streams, create and im prove parks and trails, and revitalize cities and towns. After a decade of success, the funding sources that support Growing Greener are nearly gone.
To ensure that our communities can continue their work, the Commonwealth needs to renew Growing Greener by investing $200 million annually in vital conservation, restoration and community revitalization projects.
Growing Greener – A Legacy of Success
Growing Greener has been hugely successful, directing critical investments to every county in the state. In the past four years alone, Growing Greener has helped people:
- Protect more than 33,700 acres of Pennsylvania’s family farmland;
- Conserve more than 42,300 acres of threatened open space;
- Improve public recreation through 234 community park projects;
- Restore more than 1,600 acres of abandoned mine land.
Polls show strong, consistent public support for programs that improve our quality of life, the economy and the environment throughout Pennsylvania. Growing Greener has enjoyed strong, bipartisan support from voters, legislators, and governors for more than a decade.
The Need to Renew Growing Greener
We are facing critical challenges in our ability to meet our obligations to future generations. The success of Growing Greener is undeniable, but there is much more left to do.
We are losing three times as much forest, wildlife habitat, farmland and other open spaces to development as we are able to conserve;
- Our rivers and streams—and the communities that depend on them—are threatened by flooding and pollution. The Commonwealth currently has 16,000 miles of streams that are unfit for swimming or fishing;
- Abandoned mines scar 189,000 acres in 44 counties and are the cause of 5,300 miles of dead streams
- Pennsylvania has made good progress in protecting produc tive farmland to safeguard our food supply but more than 2,000 families remain on a waiting list to protect their farms;
- 58% of the state’s population lives in older communities that have an urgent need for investment aimed at improving livability and prosperity: rehabilitating parks, establishing trails, planting trees, managing stormwater, renovating waterfronts, redeveloping brownfields and preserving historic places.
It is essential that Pennsylvania continues to build on past investments in the environmental quality of our state by making conservation and restoration of our environment a top priority for the future. A lot has been accomplished over recent years but there remains much to do to ensure the long term viability of our environment, our communities, and our economy.

By tradition, the Hugo voting process also includes the
John W. Campbell
Award for Best New Writer. The Campbell Award is not a Hugo, and the rules
governing it are determined by the award sponsor, Dell Magazines, but
by long agreement the award is selected alongside the Hugos and presented
with them at the Worldcon Hugo Award Ceremony.
* The Best Graphic Story Hugo is currently undergoing a trial period. This award was ratified
at Anticipation, the 2009 Worldcon, and will be awarded until 2012. However, it must be
re-ratified at the Business Meeting of the 2012 Worldcon or it will automatically "sunset"
and be removed as a category.
"World Science Fiction Society", "WSFS", "World Science Fiction Convention", "Worldcon", "NASFiC", "Hugo Award", the Hugo Award Logo, and the distinctive design of the Hugo Award Rocket are service marks of the World Science Fiction Society, an unincorporated literary society.

Path-based Inductive Synthesis for Program Inversion
Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the problem of semi-automated inversion of imperative programs, which has the potential to make it much easier and less error prone to write programs that naturally pair as inverses, such as insert/delete operations, compressors/decompressors, and so on. Viewing inversion as a subproblem of program synthesis, we propose a novel synthesis technique called Path-based Inductive Synthesis (PINS) and apply it to inversion. PINS starts from a program P and a template T for its inverse. PINS then iteratively refines the space of template instantiations by exploring paths in the composition of P and T with symbolic execution. PINS uses an SMT solver to intelligently guide the refinement process, based on the paths explored so far. The key idea motivating this approach is the small path-bound hypothesis: that the behavior of a program can be summarized with a small, carefully chosen set of its program paths. We evaluated PINS by using it to invert 14 programs such as compressors (e.g., Lempel-Ziv-Welch), encoders (e.g., UUEncode), and arithmetic operations (e.g., vector rotation). Most of these examples are difficult or impossible to invert using prior techniques, but PINS was able to invert all of them. We also found that a semi-automated technique we developed to mine a template from the program to be inverted worked well. In our experiments, PINS takes between one second to thirty minutes to synthesize inverses. We believe this proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the viability of the PINS approach to program synthesis.

Human Research Ethics at UNSW
Grants Management Office
The University of New South Wales is committed to the highest standard of integrity in research. All human research activities are governed by the principles outlined in the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.
The University’s Code of Conduct for the Responsible Practice of Research sets out the obligations on all University researchers, staff and students to be aware of the ethical framework governing research at the University and to comply with institutional and regulatory requirements.
There are two methods by which research projects involving human participants are reviewed at UNSW:
1. The first is by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) which review all projects which contain significant ethical concerns.
2. The second is review by one of nine discipline-based Human Research Ethics Advisory (HREA) Panels which are concerned with research which has minimal ethical impact.
Panels can give approval for one year only, and in exceptional circumstances, may approve a one year extension. Projects that are expected to go over one year, eg PhD research projects, should apply to the HREC for a 5 year approval.
Important Changes to Ratification of External HREC Approvals
UNSW HREC no longer ratifies external HREC approvals. For applications already approved by a NHMRC-registered Australian HREC, no further action is required. For applications approved by an overseas ethics committee, a formal application to UNSW HREC (or Panel, if low ethical risk) must be made. For projects approved by an Australian HREC, e.g. at a hospital, but for which the approval is limited to that site or for only part of the activities to be undertaken, UNSW HREC will review the existing application and approval paperwork, along with an appropriately amended participant information statement and consent form (e.g. including the UNSW complaints clause), to provide approval that includes the remaining sites and activities. Any UNSW researcher undertaking research at UNSW as part of their employment is covered by our insurance policies.
Applying for Human Ethics Approval
- For more information and definitions, see Human Ethics General Procedures.
Non-UNSW Researchers
The UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) will consider ethics applications from clients not affiliated with UNSW who wish to conduct research involving or impacting upon humans.

- Title
- Prototypicality, conformity and depersonalized attraction: a self-categorization analysis of group cohesiveness
- Author(s)
- Hogg, Michael A.; Hardie, Elizabeth A.
- Abstract
- The affective component of group cohesiveness is reconceptualized in terms of a distinct group-based form of attraction: social attraction. It is hypothesized, from self-categorization theory, that under conditions of self-conception based on social as opposed to personal identity the basis and structure of attraction within a group becomes depersonalized in terms of the group prototype. Four-person single-sex groups made autokinetic judgements under conditions designed to accentuate individuality (low salience) or group membership (high salience). Females behaved as predicted. They manifested depersonalized attraction associated with self-categorization in group terms, indicated by greater convergence on the group norm in the high salience condition. For males depersonalized attraction occurred in the low salience condition and was linked to convergence on some, not all, measures. The results are discussed in terms of subjective uncertainty, which was abnormally and inexplicably high among low salience male groups, and differences between this and an earlier naturalistic study by Hogg & Hardie (1991). In the light of this discussion it is concluded that the data for both sexes conform to a self-categorization analysis of social attraction.

Lymph nodes samples can be obtained by:
- Needle biopsy
- Open biopsy
There are two types of needle biopsies:
- Fine needle biopsy —The doctor will use a thin, hollow needle to obtain tissue samples.
- Core needle biopsy—The doctor will use a larger needle to cut out a piece of tissue.
The doctor may use an ultrasound or CT scan to help locate the biopsy site.
An open biopsy means removing the lymph nodes through an incision. The doctor will cut into the skin and remove either all or part of a lymph node. medicine.
Post-procedure Care
When you return home after the procedure, do the following to help ensure a smooth recovery:
- Keep the biopsy site clean and dry.
- Ask your doctor about when it is safe to shower, bathe, or soak in water.
- Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions .
Results will be ready in about a week. Your doctor will tell you if further treatment is needed.
Call Your Doctor
After arriving home, contact your doctor if any of the following occurs:
- Signs of infection, including fever and chills
- Redness, swelling, increasing pain, excessive bleeding, or any discharge from the incision site

War and the Global Economic Crisis: Collapse of the American Standard of Living
by Bob Chapman
Global Research
May 7, 2011
As the economy stumbles the American standard of living recedes. 44 million people are using food stamps and in one year that figure will be 60 million. Washington and Wall Street say, what me worry? Of course not they are the masters of the universe. We are 24 months into an inflationary depression and it still goes undiscovered. Who cares that the issuance of food stamps is up 80%, as long as the bonuses on Wall Street and in banking continue to flow and bureaucrats get higher and higher salaries and benefits? The high cost of health insurance, no longer affordable to most have increased and Medicaid users are up 17%, as the program costs increased 36%. Those on welfare rose 18%, as costs rose 24%. It is now evident to many that the choice of early retirement in the late 1990s at 52 and 59 years old was a big mistake. Many must now work into their 70s, or starve. Many retirees are forced to reenter the workforce. Recently there were 2,000 job openings and 75,000 people applied. How is that for recovery? The birth/death ratio is bogus and real unemployment is 22%. The economy needs 2 million new jobs a year and that is impossible. Good paying jobs are still being offshored and outsourced. How about the millions without jobs now for years? While all this transpires the Fed bails out Wall Street, banking and government and leaves crumbs for the dispossessed.
It always gets us when these acceptable writers use soft or euphuistic phrases to describe creeping national state socialism. The big picture is dreadful, but government, Wall Street and the media won’t tell you that. Truth has nothing to do with business. They all spin one lie after another, just as you have recently seen with a certificate of live birth and the death of Mr. bin Laden. It reminds one of the old song, “Anything Goes.”
Those running Washington from behind the scenes know America can never pay off and liquidate its debt. That is why there is little effort to do so. The real idea is to destroy the system. It reminds one of Argentina in 1999, before they defaulted on 2/3’s of their debt only in a much bigger way. The dollar, because it is the world reserve currency, and that nations hold about 60% of foreign reserves in US dollars affects the entire world. America’s Wall Street, banking and government has had a 66-year party and everyone gets to pay for it. The next step, rather than austerity, will be confiscation of all, or part, of pensions, that $12 trillion pool of government and individual retirement funds. Needless to say, such irresponsible actions only delay the inevitable monetary collapse.
Tagging not far beyond is England and Europe, both of which have used the same template for so many years. In the US and all of these nations we see more than 50% of the population functionally illiterate and this same group country to country essentially pays little or not taxes, and receive benefits from government. That does not include the illegal alien population in each country that pays virtually no taxes. Spending far beyond tax receipts can only mean eventually that the deficits will destroy the system. That means a lower standard of living, which has already manifested itself in all three regions. Such profligacy has in the US, UK and Europe caused the Fed, the Bank of England the European Central Banks to create money and credit out of thin air monetizing buying and holding sovereign debt as well as debt clogging the balance sheets of the financial sector. In Washington the administration is considering an oil tax increase as the public pays more than $4.00 a gallon and in Germany it’s $9.00 a gallon. Expect more of this non-income tax taxation. Each tax increase and each loss in services brings less purchasing power, as inflation rages.
All these entities each day find it harder and harder to sell bonds to support their debt load, thus, revenues have to be increased. In the US the top 10% of taxpayers will end up paying 75% of total income taxes. This has already started an exodus of high-income earners to leave the country over the past 15 years, and the numbers are increasing exponentially. That in turn throws an added burden on middle class taxpayers.
At the root of the problems of all these nations is Keynesian economics, which has become the basis for corporatist fascism. The growth of money and credit worldwide has been exponential and continues apace as nations refuse to cut spending and central banks continue to be fonts of money and credit for their financial sectors and for governments. The financial system worldwide is awash in liquidity, which is accompanied by low or near zero interest rates. If those conditions were to be higher interest rates and less monetization the world system would collapse, although governments are manipulating markets downward such as gold, silver and commodities. What they are accomplishing is very little versus the intermediate to long run. That is why in the long run gold, silver and commodities have to move higher, as investors flee the general stock and bond markets, that don’t reflect the results of inflation. That is why inflation will worsen as central banks continue to spew out more money and credit, which is now euphemistically called quantitative easing. First we saw inflation rise in the developing world for a number of reasons, which has since moderated to a great extent. Inflation is growing at a realistic 4% to 6% overall. The problem lies in the developed world where real inflation runs from 8% to 20%. Nations such as the US, UK, China, India, Brazil, etc. are not only suffering high inflation, but they are exporting it as well. Not enough to keep inflation at bay in their own countries, but enough to make financial conditions in victimized countries difficult. As an example, take America’s neighbors Canada and Mexico; instead of having a natural 3.5% inflation for 2011, their inflation at year-end will be 4% to 4.5%.
As we predicted a year ago, QE3 will become reality, although it will be called something else. Not only in the US, but also in the UK, Europe and other countries, as well. If the issuance of money and credit were to stop and interest rates were to rise the world would head into deflationary depression. That is why the music has to continue. Sooner or later it will stop and when it does the bottom will fall out of the world economy and financial system.
The Fed continues to create money and credit and prices continue to rise and will do so for at least 1-1/2 more years. If we get the equivalent of QE3 that will be extended 1 to 1-1/2 more years. Dependent on how big a QE3 could be two to three years ahead, inflation could range from 25% to 55%. As this affects the US economy the banking system will remain weak and near insolvency. As inflation rises in a moderate fashion in the developing world the first world will see inflation rise higher quickly.
We currently see yields on Treasuries falling again from 3.60% on the 10-year note to 3.22%, as the Fed manipulates lower yields into position. That would be in anticipation of higher real interest rates caused in reaction to QE3. This is all rear guard action to try to create employment from a sector that remains under intense pressure. Any job creation is being offset by the high layoff rates of municipal and state workers. These measures by the Fed will also continue downward pressure on the dollar and upward pressure on gold and silver and commodities. Any tightening by the government or austerity measures to reduce the fiscal deficit would be disastrous. That is if you want to keep the game going at today’s level. It is a different story if you really want to solve the problem.
As we switch to the Middle East we see serious trouble coming. In fact it probably is the groundwork for World War III, the event needed from an historical prospective to begin a new world war to cover up the economic and financial collapse now taking place. Why else would the US and UK stir up rebellion in Syria, the home of a Russian naval base and in Libya where the Chinese just recently had to remove 29,000 workers due to a US and UK created rebellion. Libya supplies relatively inexpensive quality oil to China in large quantities. As these adventures unfold it becomes more obvious that a new war is being set in motion. As a reaction we see China saying they want to reduce their dollar forex position by 2/3’s or by $2 trillion. The US won’t let that stop them, so China is going to be a large dollar seller and part of those funds will go in gold and silver. That means the dollar will definitely fall lower both in terms of other currencies, but more importantly versus gold and silver. Dollar bulls are very hard to find. Those negative regarding the dollar we doubt have a clue that WWIII is underway. What has come to the attention of those negative on the dollar is that the US is developing into a Nazi police state. The US government wants to know exactly where all the assets of every American are and at the same time set compliance rules on foreign banks and institutions, which have US persons as clients legally. For Americans, foreign countries have to report any real estate owned by Americans in their country and on January 1, 2013, annually these nations banks have to send 1/3rd of all bank assets to the US IRS ostensibly to pay taxes, which in most instances have already been paid. It is a grab of the assets of Americans who dare to live in another country. As a result the US government gets little or no respect outside the US. The US is a pariah and the laughing stock of the rest of the civilized world. What people other than Americans could believe the fantasies of the obviously phony “live birth certificate” and the death of a man that had already been dead for almost 10 years. The foreign opinion is that the sheeple deserve it.
As an adjunct to this the US government is going to keep US troops in Iraq beyond the end of the year. The Iraqis have to approve this action, so we’ll have to see what happens. It is obvious the US has no intention of permanently withdrawing their troops. The excuse is based on the Shiite uprising in Bahrain and the massive Saudi intervention, along with events in Yemen where the dictator has agreed to leave. Iraqis believe that accommodation with Iran is the only way to coexist. They see iran as the only real power in the region. They also recognize Iran as an emerging regional power. Thus, we see Iran balking at the US leaving 20,000 troops in Iraq.

Luke Koehler ’09 is the new Cadet Battalion Commander of the Army ROTC program. Rhodes, in cooperation with The University of Memphis and the Departments of the Army and Air Force, participates in cross-town agreements that provide the opportunity for Rhodes students to enroll in ROTC.
“This is quite an honor and is the first time a student from Rhodes College has held this position in the program’s 26 year history,” says LTC Gregory Marinich.
Koehler is a graduate of the United States Army Air Assault School and the United States Army Parachutist School. This summer, he attended the Leadership Development and Assessment Course in Fort Lewis, WA where he earned the overall rating of “Excellent,” awarded to only 20 percent of the 5,100 cadets in attendance.

When Vicki Sawicki leaves her Atchison Village home, there’s often a foul tang that permeates the air.
“The pollution is so strong that sometimes you can taste it.” Sawicki said, her face scrunching into a grimace. “It’s kind of a metallic kind of taste.”
Sawicki and several dozen other Bay Area residents met in North Richmond on Saturday at the invitation of the Toxic Triangle Coalition, founded by the Reverend Dr. Daniel Buford of the Allen Temple Baptist Church in Oakland.
The group is an effort to pull together three Bay Area neighborhoods that residents and air quality officials say have been disproportionately affected by toxic contaminants and environmental hazards. Richmond is located at the northern apex of the “Toxic Triangle,” with Oakland to the south and Bayview Hunter’s Point to the west.
Jack Broadbent is CEO and the Air Pollution Control Officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD).
Marie Harrison came from Bayview Hunter's Point neighborhood in San Francisco for Saturday's Toxic Triangle meeting.
At Saturday’s meeting, Broadbent attributed many of the health problems experienced by members of these neighborhoods to “diesel particulate matter,” a kind of air pollutant that comes from combustion engines.
Among the majors sources of these tiny particles are moving vehicles like cars, trucks, tankers, trains, and buses. Stationary sources of particulate pollution include power plants, factories, and refineries.
Bayview resident Marie Harrison described some of the health problems she has seen in her neighborhood: asthma, cancer, heart disease, headaches, severe rashes, and nosebleeds.
Richmond has the same problems: The Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative has collated data showing Richmond has both high levels of diesel particulate pollution and the highest levels of child asthma hospitalizations in all of Contra Costa County.
Environmental activist and Richmond resident Gwendolyn Powell sees a wide range of health problems among her neighbors and her own family.
Gwendolyn Powell of Richmond often has breathing problems because of the air around her Las Deltas home.
Powell’s stepfather died in 2001, after suffering from asthma, a condition her brother also struggles with. Her cousin died from an asthma attack.
A 50-year resident of North Richmond, Powell said she’s become concerned about the health risks of living so close to the Chevron refinery.
Yet the refinery is one part of a larger problem. In each of the communities that comprise the Toxic Triangle, multiple sources of pollution are infecting the neighborhoods in compounding ways.
Bayview Hunter’s Point residents, for example, breathe emissions wafting off the 101 and 280 freeways. There are also two federal Superfund sites and hundreds of acres of contaminated brownfields from a former naval shipyard.
In addition to the Chevron smokestacks in Richmond, residents must contend with busy freeways running through the community; with a port, where diesel trucks come and go hour upon hour; and with the rail yards, where trains have been known to idle their engines for days at a time.
This infrastructure of pollution that is literally built into neighborhoods—neighborhoods where residents are largely low-income ethnic minorities—is what’s called environmental racism.
Tiana Drisker, 30, of Richmond talks with Phillip Watkins Jr, 22, at Saturday's meeting. Watkins came from Oakland for the event.
“This is not just about trash on the ground,” said Tiana Drisker. “We have been conditioned to think this is normal,” she said of the foul smells, hazy air, and history of contaminated land.
Drisker, 30, lives in Richmond. Several years ago, she became involved with Communities for a Better Environment, a California based non-profit focused on environmental health and justice.
She became so passionate about environmental health that she’s leaving behind a completed dental hygienist degree to enter an environmental program. Drisker plans to help educate her community about the risks pollutants pose to their wellbeing.
It’s time for Richmond residents to “demand accountability, demand responsibility,” Drisker said, encouraging other young people in the audience to continue to get involved and give a voice to their communities.
Mayor Gayle McLaughlin briefly attended the meeting, pledging to fight environmental injustice and noting her efforts to build bike paths and community gardens.
What Vicki Sawicki wants is a little harder than new gardens and bike trails. “I don’t want to inhale any toxic chemicals,” she said following Saturday’s meeting.
Richmond mayor Gayle McLaughlin listens to Jack Broadbent's presentation in North Richmond on Saturday.
In the ten years that Sawicki has lived in Atchison Village, several times she’s gotten the alert to “shelter-in-place,” which means to close all windows, doors, and sources of ventilation to the outside environment.
As part of Contra Costa County’s emergency response directions, residents are instructed to shelter-in-place whenever harmful levels of toxins are released in the air. “It’s scary,” Sawicki said about the alerts.
“I’m not a chemist, but I know the air is not healthy to breathe,” she continued. “We all have a right to breath clean air.”
It’s interesting how the Mayor of Richmond was only there for a photo opportunity and not to really listen to the issues. If she had been there for the entire meeting, she would have realized that the residents need stricter laws against the refineries and businesses for polluting the air not more “bike paths and community gardens”. Who wants to go out and do heavy breathing of toxins while riding a bike or planting fresh vegetables and fruits in tainted soil? Think about it people! It must be election time or maybe the author just picked the wrong quote/sound-bite to include in this piece.*wink,wink*

RICHMOND —
As of Tuesday, the local headquarters of the Salvation Army was down $10,000 to $12,000 in donations compared to this time last year, said Salvation Army Capt. Sally Love.
Some may be unaware of this, but “all of the money donated in Richmond stays in Richmond,” Love said. And 60 percent of the donations used to help people all year are collected at Christmas-time. These donations help fund a soup kitchen, thrift store and shelter right here in Madison County.
The Richmond branch has a work area expanding over Estill, Lee and Rockcastle counties as well, she said. Funds collected from those areas also go back into those communities.
One factor has contributed to the shortfall in donations: the lack of people who carry cash. Newspapers from all over the nation have reported the same problem, leaving the signature red kettles shortchanged everywhere.
Last year, however, Salvation Army USA reported a 3.4 percent increase in overall donations from 2010. This accomplishment was, in part, due to increased online donations, according to a release from the organization.
“We have been working to expand the Red Kettle Campaign to reach new and young donors,” said Commissioner William Roberts, National Commander of The Salvation Army. “Technology is changing the way charities raise money. Whether through a credit card at a kettle or online, we’re making an effort to reach the next generation of donors and make it convenient for people to support the campaign.”
As with donations collected at local storefronts, all money collected online from those who indicate they live in Richmond, will go back into the community, Love said.
One option is the Online Red Kettle (onlineredkettle.org). Donors can create online kettle teams and share the link through email and social media (Search your smartphone app store — there’s an app for that).
“Online bell-ringers” have collected funds for the seventh year in a row and raised more than $1.7 million last year, up from $1.6 million in 2010.
Other online donations in November and December, not through the Online Red Kettle systems, totaled $17.6 million, a 28-percent increase over the $13.7 million raised in 2010, according to the release.
There also have been nationwide efforts to make donations easier for those who only carry debit/credit cards. Last year, smartphones and mobile credit card readers were donated to the Salvation Army to begin test markets in San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and New York.
Love said the decision to have mobile card readers in Madison County locations will be reassessed each year, but they also must consider how that might impact partners that allow bell-ringers in their storefronts.
Donors may also visit the Richmond Salvation Army office at 1675 E. Main Street to donate using a credit card, Love said. Check donations may be sent to the same location.
Angel Giving Tree
This Saturday, the Richmond Salvation Army location will be distributing Christmas food bags, gifts and stockings to more than 450 children, seniors and low-income families as part of the Angel Giving Tree program, Love said.
Although registration to benefit from this program ended in October, people will have the opportunity to sign up for any goods that are leftover on Monday and Tuesday (Dec. 17-18) from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Richmond location.
The Christmas food bags include around $25 worth of “all the fixings of a holiday dinner,” Love said. Children will receive gifts, as well as age-appropriate stuffed stockings for both boys and girls.
For the first time, age-appropriate stockings have been prepared for senior citizens who receive food bags from the Angel Giving Tree, Love said.
Those who would like to apply for any of the leftover goods would need to provide proof of income or government assistance, a picture ID for the head of household and social security cards or birth certificates for each member of the family.
“If you qualify for food stamps, you would most likely qualify for our program,” said Love, who uses similar income criteria regarding family size.
Those who qualify for the Angel Giving Tree also must not have already benefited from any other children’s gift assistance in town, she said.

How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
With apologies for the downer of a topic, but . . .
A married couple of our acquaintance will soon attend a memorial service for a woman who recently passed away, and of whom their young daughter was quite fond. They have not yet told their daughter of the woman’s death as they are at a loss as to how to proceed with such a discussion. I told them I would put the matter out for consideration among the Ricochetti, where much wisdom can reliably be found.
Their daughter is three years old, and this will be her first experience with the death of anyone she knows. What have you told your own children under these circumstances, and what questions were you met with? Your thoughts on this very important question will be much appreciated by all concerned.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
We talk to our daughters (just turned 6 and about to turn 5) about this fallen world regularly. So they already understand that death is a consequence of sin. We lost a dog a couple of years ago and my parents nextdoor had to bury one of their dogs. So the girls have experienced loss and they know why it happens. More importantly, they take comfort in their Baptism and the Resurrection to come.
Dealing with the loss of a human friend would be harder, especially if the friend wasn't a Christian. But they have the knowledge (framework) in place to make sense of it and they know where to find Comfort.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
My family has been through a lot of death. Our baby daughter, my mother, and my best friend. We have two other children (8 and 6 at the time) and we simply told them about death as honestly as we could. It's a lot to grasp, and it is clear they didn't grasp all of it, but they got the important stuff. Might be too much for a three year old to get.
Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
As a pastor's kid, I grew up around a fair amount of death. Our backyard backed up to a cemetery. We were brought to the homes of people near death and we were brought to their funerals. I've tried the same approach with my children -- just explaining what cemeteries are, taking them to funerals of church members who have died.
As for what to say to a 3-year-old, there's some chance the child won't exactly understand much of what's happened. Start with the basics -- "Our friend died. We won't be able to see her any more." Then just answer whatever questions come up. That will vary by child. Simple, short answers are better. If you're in anguish over what to say, you're probably over thinking it.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
It helps to remember that everyone has to deal with death sooner or later. We've all gone through it.
It helps to remember, then, how we ourselves got through those first experiences. I was lucky. My first experiences of death were elderly family members, and I was part of a very Catholic family. We had wakes and funeral masses and other rituals. I learned how to behave (and really, how to respond emotionally) by watching my family during those rituals. Death was treated with solemnity and respect.
I'll say the obvious ... at that age, it isn't about passing along information to a young person. The young person will be having feelings that she never had before, and she won't know what to do with them. So, the older generation has a sacred responsibility to teach the younger generation how to respond. They'll learn; not by words, but by reactions.
That's why rituals are so useful. They teach emotion; they teach how to respond. They give emotions an outlet, so that people know what to do with them.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
When my grandmother passed away, I told my 4-year-old (at the time) that "when we die, we go back to God". I was expecting questions, but none arose. My simple explanation seemed to be sufficient.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
If the child was very fond of this lady I think she should not be shut out of this. She needn't be confronted harshly with it, but an adult on whose shoulder she will be comfortable crying should tell her gently and help her with the details. I lay pretty good odds that the child will want to go to the funeral, and if she clearly understands what it all means, I'm for letting her go. Small children can and do grieve, and death is a natural thing to them; it's not easy for anyone. But they are robbed when we treat them as incapable of dealing with the truth. Imagine the child, a month from now, "Mommy, when can we visit Mrs X? She said next time we come I can have a ginger cookie, and I drew her another picture." "Uh, I'm sorry honey, Mrs. X is ... um ... gone away ... ask me again sometime, but not today". When the child finally learns, she'll be furious that she was not permitted the chance to "properly" say goodbye. I'm 100% in agreement with KCM above.
Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
Many thanks for the thoughtful responses so far. I knew the Ricochetti would not disappoint.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
My mother always said "He/she went to live with God."
I am a big fan of taking children to cemeteries for unveilings and plain visits. Funerals too, after a certain age. (I was angry with my parents for many years because they would not let me attend my grandfather's funeral when I was nine. Their excuse was that I am the eldest of my generation and the elders still thought of me as a kid.
One of my sisters was killed in an accident and most of the nieces and nephews participated in the funeral and the unveiling, including shoveling dirt into the grave. These were 7-8 year olds. (The eldest of her own kids was not yet twelve.)
But of course I am a genealogist, so I go to cemeteries for fun.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
I don't know if the little girl was raised Catholic, Jack. But, if she was, please insist that prayers for the departed are a good thing for a child to learn. They are sadly neglected in our day.
Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
I should have mentioned this. Yes, the family is Catholic, and prayers are part of their daily and nightly routine.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
It is important to remember that for preschoolers coping well typically means sticking to routine as much as possible. If this woman played a role that was part of a daily or weekly routine, her death will need to be addressed both in the context of the funeral and in the context of the activity (Ms. Sue won't be at church this Sunday to hug you). For younger kids, describing death as an inability to do activities they understand can be helpful.
As adults we tend to over-think and over-answer kid questions about death. Remember that a 3 year old still thinks the moon follows her car ; ) Simple, direct answers; routine and ritual cover a multitude of stammering adult statements.
Also, it's not uncommon (even if she attends the funeral) for a smaller child to ask to visit the deceased person, or what happened to their friend later, perhaps multiple times. Not a problem, just typical development.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
When our second child was in neo-natal intensive care we told her 3 year old brother "Your sister is very sick and we don't know yet whether she's going to come home with us or go home with Jesus." That seemed to work.
(BTW She pulled through and is with us today, 28 years later)

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
Don't say anything you don't believe yourself and keep the explanation age specific.
We had to deal with this a few years ago when our 17-year old son died and we still had 5 kids at home, ages ranging from 5 to 15. Based on his profession of faith we felt confident in telling the younger kids he was in heaven. But while his salvation is a wonderful thing, we still did a lot of crying because we missed him so much. It rocks a kid's world to see the parents in that much pain, but I can't agree with people who feel the need to shield the kids from it. I didn't want my kids to grow up thinking - J. died and Mom and Dad never even cried for him.
I also don't think it's a good idea to make the death a taboo subject. We answered all kinds of questions, such as, can I call J. on his cell phone? With kids, be prepared for some touching and even funny moments. Our 5-year old, a few days after the funeral, demanded to know where his brother was.
Nov '10
Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
We patiently told him - in heaven. And he said, "no not that one, the one that's in the dirt." Try explaining that to a 5-year old. Also, our son died in another state and the first few days were filled with phone calls and preparations for getting his body back. When the call finally came that he was coming the next day I turned to one of the kids, age 7, and said, "J.'s body is coming back tomorrow." Her response - "what about his head"?
I've come to believe that if you can't explain it to so a 5-year old can understand, you don't understand it yourself. Keep the answers truthful, but age specific. Having a robust theology of dying, death, and the afterlife helps tremendously.
Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
Kim K.,
I'm so terribly saddened to read about the death of your oldest son. I pray for continued comfort for you. And I thank you for the advice you offer. I couldn't agree more with your last line.

Life is opportunity.
Death is the end of those opportunities.
Jews and Christians agree on this much: death is when the soul returns to G-d.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
My mother died of heart failure when I was nine and a half, my brother eight and my sister six and a half. My father came home from the hospital and gathered us around him and told us. I think we did not know what it meant except that mom wasn't coming home.
Only over time did the immensity of death become recognizable in a family. A place to come to but no one to come home to. An echo or shadow of who once was but is now not to be found; and an empty place in the heart that remains open but unfilled.
It is terrible and no matter what else happens, it must be faced.
At some point down the line, someone must sit with that child and help her get it out of her system. The child's mere expression met with some compassion will allow her to put it down and not have to pick it up again, relegating it to a fond memory of a missing friend.Edited on December 31, 2012 at 5:05pm

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
Just got home from a funeral of an 80 year old man, it was as natural as the snow falling outside the church. What you need to say is in there somewhere, it's a natural .
My daughter went to a visitation last night for a high school classmate killed in a car wreck over the weekend , I don't think that is natural as it wrenches the cycle out of rhythm . Words are very hard to find for that.

The topic of death is much easier to confront with children when the topic of God has been an essential part of their childhood.

Re: How Do You Talk to a Child About Death?
How do we adults address the imponderable? How may a child understand?
I observed, weak-kneed, the following:
A Norman Rockwell setting. A great grandfather - a minister, has died. Gathered in a late-summer country cemetery, his descendants . . children, grandchildren, great grandchildren gather around the catafalque.
My farmer brother-in-law presides over the assembled mourners. Birds sweep above cornfields, the air is sweet . . . . his daughter brings her 10 year-old son forward to be comforted by the rugged handsome grandfather. I'm waiting expectantly for this midwestern iconic moment of generational nurturing.
The paterfamilias drops to one knee beside the catafalque and pulls the child toward him. Even the breeze pauses. We watch a timeless tableau. The grandfather points toward the casket. He speaks. "That will be you someday. Live your life accordingly."
I've wondered ever since, what doors closed in that child's heart. I cannot help but to believe that some part of his emotional life, forever, veered in a direction it might not otherwise have gone.
One could argue that it was a wise appraisal of what one might take from a death. For me, it was callous and brutal and no one visibly flinched.

New PvP Content in RIFT 1.9? Can You Decipher These Codes?
It seems that RIFT Team wants to challenge our intelligence by offering these codes in the forum.
Well, if you cannot see picture, I've posted all the contents below:, Nemo surdior est quam is qui non audiet, is written in Latin. It is like, "you will hear what he(the Dev) said here".
Dev: 3 3228466 787 posted this thread in forum. Obviously, it's a new ID for this, which joined in May 2012 with only 11 posts. Actually, I followed his posts time line and found other threads he posted in forum. I will analysis little by little and the answer will be unveiled soon!
Thread in the PvP & Warfronts Forum titled "There can be no peace":
Source:
As we can see from the sub forum where this guy posted his thread, it's possibly something about PvP coz it's the first post after the cypher.
Thread in the public test shard Forum titled "Be careful what you ask for":
Source:
Thread in the Dungeons & Raids Forum titled "Keep your friends close ":
Source:
Both are for promoting his cypher post, nothing special. I guess it will be appeared first at PTS(you don't say that?) and maybe in Dungeons and Raids as well?
Then he posted something in numbers! So I paid more attention to his ID: 3 3228466 787. What does it mean? Is it the code as well? Well, actually it's a easy code if you check out your mobile phone! Let's decipher them!
3=3
3=F
2=A
2=C
8=T
4=I
6=O
6=N
7=P
8=V
7=P
3 FACTION PVP!
Really?!!!
Well, he kept posting after that, so let's see more about them!
Reply to "Nemo surdior est quam is qui non audiet"
Source:
These three pics are:
Fun pics. Apparently, three factions, Ram, Raven and Lion, which he mentioned in the cypher.
Let's go back to see the cypher again, now it would be more clearly that some words suggest battle among 3 factions like "Three points the blade, but two edges bleed".
Then he posted some replies in forum by numbers, which is easy to understand but without any valuable information in it, like "we so excited" and "we so excited too". You can find them here, here and here.
I couldn't see more valuable leaks about it so far. However, at least we got this - "3 faction pvp", which is possible new feature added in RIFT 1.9! Maybe we will see it in 1.8 next week.

We chat with one of Sci-Fi’s greatest doctors about DS9 and his new indie hit Cairo Time.
On Being Bashir:
Jordan Hoffman: Before we talk about your new indie Cairo Time, let’s talk about the greatest television series in the history of time, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. It’ll always be the greatest and, for better or worse, no matter where you go we will always love Dr. Bashir and his adventures. The show has been off the air for -
Alexander Siddig: A decade.
Jordan Hoffman: Over a decade.
Alexander Siddig: Yeah, a decade and then some.
Jordan Hoffman: I’m just curious to know, now that you’ve got a lot of time behind it, what it’s like if you’re flipping channels or somebody calls you Dr. Bashir on the street?
Alexander.
Jordan Hoffman: This is Primeval, yes?
Alexander Siddig: Yes, and kids –.
Changing the DNA:
Jordan Hoffman: I’m curious, was there ever one episode where you got the script and were just like, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what
the hell they’re talking about.”
Alexander Siddig: Yeah, there was an episode where they gave me a genetic modification. (Dr. Bashir, I Presume Season 5, Episode 16)
Jordan Hoffman: Oh, well that wasn’t an episode that was a major change in your character!.
Jordan Hoffman: Okay, so maybe they scaled that story arc back a little bit?
Alexander Siddig: They did.

The revenge of Don Carcieri.
This foolish investment by Carcieri and his enablers at the state EDC and in the General Assembly is slated to cost RI taxpayers $12.5 million a year for seven years, money that would obviously be much better spent on roads, schools and creating a better business climate.
This is a sad case for taxpayers and Rhode Island’s economic future. Carcieri did this as he was waving goodbye at the end of his second term, which was an unmitigated disaster in terms of economic stewardship of the state. It is interesting to see Gary Sasse, onetime top aide to Carcieri (although not when the Schilling deal was done; he was gone by then), lecture the Assenbly now on how to proceed. Sasse is right; lawmakers ought to ``undertake a rigorous analysis’’ of the cost and benefits of various options for cleaning up the mess. It is only too bad that pillars of the R.I. business establishment as Sasse and former Hasbro honcho Al Verecchia (who actually went along with this one as an EDC board member) weren’t yelling from the top of the State House back in August of 2010 about absolutely dumb was this investment.
Lawmakers should think long and hard about their role in this miasma. Remember just one legislator, former House Republican Leader Robert Watson of East Greenwich, voted against the enabling legislation that allowed the $75 million in taxpayer loan guarantees to go to 38 Studios. The media, with a few exceptions (such as RIPR), didn’t cover itself in glory on this one by vetting the deal and questioning why the rush?
This deal obviously should have waited for a new gubernatorial administration. It should have not been coaxed through three months before the election. There was no urgency; no other state was vying to hand out this sum of money to a retired pitcher with a tin cup out.
Democrat Deval Patrick may be a liberal Democrat to Carcieri’s conservative Republican regime. But Patrick wasn’t foolish enough to give this scheme a blank check from the taxpayers.
Chafee is now suing some of the major players who put this mess together. Let’s hope his legal thrust harvests some significant money to mitigate the crushing blow on RI taxpayers.

I came here first as a child during World War II and returned five years ago for the first of five reunions of the children, grands, partners, spouses (and now a possible great-grandchild) of Eric C. Kast, my late husband.
This year I planned a first, writing week for myself with Carter Frank and Erica Kast, and we stayed in Hidden Village on West Tisbury's Lambert Cove Road. Nearby we came upon Dr. Fisher, a dirt road whose buckles rival ocean waves. Our house was deep in woods and gave me a room with desk where I worked on my novel manuscript for several hours each day, while Carter and Erica swam long distances at Lambert Cove Beach. Nearby we discovered Ice House Pond, a fresh water kettle pond preserved by the Martha's Vineyard Land Bank, one of many organizations that strives to save land from over development.
An afternoon trip to Aquinnah (formerly Gay Head) gave us gorgeous views of the bright, clay cliffs and a glimpse of Wampanoag jewelry made form wampum, quohog shells. A winding path down to an ocean beach offers surf and a walk below the cliffs. There traditional nude bathing persists. I remember this from childhood visits to the island and was delighted to see that natural simplicity still lives, just slightly tucked away from T-shirt shops and chain store fudge.
The Mass Audobon Society offers great kayak tours of Sengekontacket Pond, an excellent way to see the birds, crabs, plants and animals of the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary as well as to support one more necessary effort to save the island from clogged roads and urban sprawl.
We reveled in the West Tisbury Farmer's Market, cooked and ate communally (10-13 peeps each night), and played games from Bananagrams to Settlers of Cataan to Ticket to Ride. We sunned and swam and played paddle ball on the East Chop Beach and indulged in Mad Martha's ice cream, Moon Magick fudge and Back-Door Donuts.
Five years is a long time, and people grow up, as the quantity of beer bottles we recycled attests. Some of the young people grew restless without bikes or car and a limited bus system, so Erica and I resolved to develop a survey to assess each person's priorities for location and activities. Her arts management studies come in handy!
The results will affect the reunion's future, but I'll always return to the Vineyard. There is so much to learn for an off-island, seasonal visitor, so many paths to wander, so much history to explore. As I contemplate the island's future, my sense of satiation returns to hunger, and I fear that the island I love cannot endure.
The Martha's Vineyard Donors Collaborative is a consortium of island non-profits that aims to use their collective strength to sustain the Vineyard. Understanding the problem is a first step, and their excellent (downloadable) pamphlet addresses the problem with a clear, severe, but humorous and well-written warning: do something now or forget a future for the island. If you've ever lived there, visited the island or wanted to, download the pamphlet, watch a video, and choose your mode of action. There's something for everyone to do.
I recommend the pamphlet from mvdonors.org. Preservation is a complex and political subject, but the authors were thoughtful and the results could be momentous. I love the national parks. I love the California coast. I love our reunions on this island.
Thank you Anton!
MV is indeed a special place as you write so well. The first week was sublime and your second week sounds equally so. Thanks for the memories.
You're welcome, and I hope we'll turn them into real-life experience again.
Beautifully captured, Maggie. What a rich, varied environment! I wanted more description, more photos, more...I wanted to be there! Door County, Wisconsin, where as you well know I have spent vacation time my entire life and where we now spend all summer, is sometimes called the "Cape Cod of the Midwest." Now, I dearly love this place--the vast lake, the magnificent bluffs, the wildlife, the art galleries, the Scandinavian culture. But it is not Cape Cod. It is not the ocean. It quite simply lacks the incredible variety that the environment you describe contains. But: home is where the heart is.
I don't think I'd previously looked at your Sicilian blog, either. Having just prepared an Italian dinner for friends and spouse, I was more than intrigued. I must say I didn't manage to serve so many courses! And I hope to go to Sicily some day--one part of Italy that I've not yet seen.
R
That's how I first felt when I went to Door County and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan: the East Coast all over again. Especially on the ferry to Neebish Island, where my mother spent summers as a child.
Looking at the picture of the MV farmer's market, and comparing it to the farmer's market in northern Door, made me smile--in fact giggle. Our farmer's market most recently had: potatoes, rutabaga, beets, green onions, lettuce, green beans--and that's about it. No corn yet; no tomatoes. Never anything mildly exotic. It's like our local super market, the PIggily Wiggily, which always reminds me of Garrison Keilor's "Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery," in Lake Woebegon: "If you can't find it at Ralph's, you can probably get along without it." Mozzarella? Forget it. Lamb chops? Nope.
On July 4th, we went to the boat regatta in Fish Creek. Or tried to. In the small print in the local newspaper, it said the 4th of July celebration would be held on the 7th. We returned on the 7th. There were hundreds of people on the pier and shore, with a rock band playing. Finally it got to be dusk, and the "Venetian Nights" type regatta began: the boats decorated with lights. All five of them. They went around twice.
On the other hand: the thermometer has exceeded 90° F. only once so far this summer, at East Haven, our place on the lake. And I caught a 12# chinook salmon, when I went out on a charter fishing boat with my brother-in-law, to which I can only say: thank God for Dramamine! I had to keep my eyes fixed to the horizon the entire four hours as the boat rose and fell. Living in the wetlands, as we do, we also have lots of wildlife and nature to enjoy: pileated woodpeckers, occasional pelicans, swans, egret, blue heron, and myriad ducks. Porcupines, deer, wild turkeys, and rarely, a fox or coyote. Actually, a coyote seems to have entered our garage one time this summer, where it ate its prey (fur and blood on the concrete floor)--and then took a dump!! Can't get closer to nature than that.
How lucky that Lake Woebegone has been preserved in Door County, when so much other natural beauty is being overrun or destroyed! Witness Montauk, NY with its "no fedora hat" signs contra hipsters.(See NY Times August 3).
Hi Maggie,
What a joy to experience your weeks at MV. The dancing bubbles has to be my favorite. And the water, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Brings back memories of trips to the Maine coast as a child. We played in the tide pools, and leaned over Thunder Hole. Next stop was Northern Maine and freeeeeeeeeeeezing cold Long Lake close to the Canadian Border. So glad you can do this with your family.
Maine sounds great. I'd love to go there sometime. I have a friend who used to go to Vinalhaven, in island in Maine,but I've not been myself.
Hi Maggie,

Sunday Week 2 of Lent A
Body, bridge and blessing—that’s what we reckoned earlier was how to read these scriptures in the context of this weekend. Body. Bridge. Blessing.
What Jesus did for us he did in the body. His joy, his labour, his love, his passion—all in his body. His transfiguration—in his body.
And what we do for him—we always do in the body. Our joy, our labour, our love, our passions—all in our bodies. Our transfiguration too—in the body, of the body, for the body—the body we each are, the body of humanity we all form, the body of the earth we share.
But between the body of God in Jesus and our own bodies there is a breach, a space, a separation—something to be bridged. How do we bridge the gap of time and space and desire? … We build the bridge with our bodies. We let him do in our bodies what he wills. And we do through our bodies what he desires. We do as he did.
But, doing as he did, we often miss the obvious. Here’s the obvious. ‘Jesus came up and touched them. “Stand up”, he said, “do not be afraid”.’ …
See?! Let us be literal … Stand up … Stand up and do not be afraid. Can you feel that in your body—what it is like to stand tall and free from fear? Can you feel him touch you with power, with life, with blessing? Can you feel him bless you?
Here is the bridge. Can we be blessed? Can we then bless? Can we use our bodies to receive and to give?
Let me read again the first reading so we can hear once more the call of our ancestors. (music starts)
…
I invite you now to receive the blessing you have just witnessed and to give it, in the same way, to your neighbour. Let it be our sign of peace …

Title
The European Council regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing: an international fisheries law perspective
Document Type
Journal Article
RIS ID
31958
Abstract
On 29 September 2008, the Council of the European Union (EU) adopted Council Regulation (EC) No. 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fi shing. Essentially, the EU IUU Regulation establishes a framework in which access to EU markets for fi sheries products is partly conditioned by the extent to which a country, area or region of origin is demonstrably or increasingly free of IUU fi shing. Aside from the amendments to US legislation in 2007, the EU IUU Regulation is the only other domestic legislative measure adopted solely to combat IUU fi shing, with four main components: port State measures against third-country vessels, a catch documentation scheme, IUU vessel listing, and listing of non-cooperating States. Th is article analyses the EU IUU Regulation in the context of international fi sheries law, and particularly international eff orts to combat IUU fi shing. It is concluded that the measures outlined in the EU IUU Regulation, despite several ambiguities, are generally consistent with those called for under international fi sheries instruments and measures being implemented by regional fi sheries management organisations.

Sustrans tells cyclists using Strava and other apps to keep off shared use paths
Charity that runs National Cycle Network reissues code of conduct and underlines that pedestrians have priority:

If the bicycle was invented tomorrow, it would be seen as the solution, not the problem.

The actual time you'd spend passing others on a ride like Bath-Bristol must be - what - 0.01% of the total ride? If someone wants to scorch it, 99.99% of the time they are doing no harm.!
I bet Sebastian Langeveld is wishing he had not rode on the cyclepath

Can pedestrians also be advised to stop wearing their headphones on shared paths, as I ring my bell; but their music stops them hearing it.
Horse riders and cyclists share the road uneasily here; my high-viz jacket, which affords me some protection from drivers, means I have to be very careful approaching horse riders, especially from behind. Asking the rider if it's OK to pass produces a grateful response 9 times out of 10. A group of 4 of us came across avery agitated horse on a country lane recently and had to dismount and wait for the rider to get it calmed down. The cause? a pair of cyclists going the opposite way who just zipped past out of the blue. Of course, in the New Forest the horse riders can go anywhere while cyclists are grudgingly given some very disjointed and easy cycle tracks and attacked regularly in the local paper.
New Forester
Perhaps it is a stupid idea to have a public app that encourages people to ride ever faster on public paths or public roads. Statistically it is going to encourage rider's worse side, and lead to more accidents.
Logically, if the apps cause this statistical change, then the apps should be legally liable.
Before it comes to that, at least public ways and steep downhills could be removed from the apps. Not so difficult to do with a little bit of computer work.
hicks
I agree with Sustrans, when we use shared lanes then we have to do the best we can to share the facilities and look after each other. Yes pedestrians sometimes behave erratically, but they're not used to looking behind them before they change direction the way a cyclist used to travelling on the road does.
I think in general the majority of cyclists do seek to take care of the pedestrians (putting up with the occassional annoyances and delays) in the same way that we ask car drivers to accept the occasional short delay when we are on the roads. I've never used Strada but, as others have already suggested, to me it sounds totally inappropriate for use on shared ped/cycle paths which surely could be easily removed from their database.
? ".
hicks.
I must say I feel very ambiguous about some of these routes, for example I not infrequently use the route across N Wales from Bangor to Rhyl. The time it takes me to do this varies (in similar weather conditions, it is E-W along the coast so wind is a big factor) from a little over two hours, at night in winter, to well over three and a half hours, Wkend daytime summer. This route is the only practicable safe way across N Wales for anything other than motorists. So is an international trunk route for cyclists etc.
Despite the recognition of this and tremendous work and endeavour to provide it, it is far from satisfactory as a through route.
The numerous bridges on it seem designed to slow cyclists as much as possible with cost saving sharp and blind corners. In addition many of the seafront sections weave between lamp posts and some of it occupies sections where fisherman put down there rods and leave car doors open (which is at least safer than opening them as you pass). Some of it passes through throngs of crowds on the sea front - especially in summer.
I think the only realistic solution here is to use a lane of the A55 exclusively for cyclists and other long distance walkers etc.
Also as far as I'am aware these routes are public highways; so the highway code applies. Much though I dislike over signage I think this fact should be reinforced - especially KEEP LEFT, as it is often other cyclists wobbling about all over the place who are a problem.
In addition, as a trunk route it should have priority over any other roads crossing it.
I also agree with what others saying, concerning the fact that if you use the road next to one of these routes, it not only tends to make motorists irate that you are not on the cycleway, but more dangerous because there are less cyclists on it.
While I do recognise that, like any other road user, I can't expect to have everything my way. On the other hand they often seem designed pretty much exclusively for dog walkers (with attendant trip wires) and children learning to ride.
Rather than using a cycle as transport.
Again, this is dumping the problem on the poor cyclist (all else being equal).
There is a sign on the path showing that it is 'shared use with cyclists.' Why is it implied that this sign is not for the benefit of pedestrians to know that they, not the cyclist, need to look out for cyclists coming, and not walk or side-step randomly? Or at least simply look before doing so? It really isn't rocket science.
The cyclist is implied to be looking carefully.
Pedestrians, having likely grown-up in a non-cycle-respecting culture, are implied to not care about their part of that 'sharing' responsibility.
Why is this refusal to take responsibility tolerated?
Will our cyclist-hostile culture ever change?
Until we can challenge such irresponsible pedestrians' behaviour, can we at least build proper cycle paths?
They're lovely to use, and when they exist, I for one, give myself no right to use pedestrian facilities, regardless of the law.
When they don't exist, I have less sympathy - but always cycle considerately and look-out for and predict others behaviour, with large safety margins.
Thus I, like I assume many cyclists, take MORE than my fair share of responsibility whilst getting from A to B. So I have no sympathy for those whose slack I'm taking up when they complain...
Forget whatever sexy gear you have: it's the man not the machine (unless you're a certain top-flight pro cyclist in which case it's the drugs). I cycle on performance-REDUCING drugs, if anything!

It Takes Two
The operating partnership between trucker and spouse
By Timothy D. Brady
Trucking is often a husband and wife enterprise, requiring the full dedication of both to make it a success — whether they drive team or one’s on the road and the other home. As any trucker will attest, the truck decides everything: when you’ll be home, when you have to leave again, whether you have money for the long-awaited vacation or the vacation becomes a new transmission. Trucking takes marriage to a whole new level.
One driving, one at home
Gail and Paul Morrison have done it all: their own authority, lease operators, OTR and local delivery. Currently Paul is doing a 614-mile-per-day dedicated run from southern Georgia to the Atlanta area and back, five days a week.
The run didn’t just happen. Paul had been doing expedited truckload, going wherever the freight needed to go. He was asked to cover a run that began 20 miles from his home in southern Georgia and went to Atlanta. The problem was, it was dedicated only one way, and the trucking company to which he’s leased was required to locate return freight. Paul noticed the company he was delivering to in Atlanta had empty parts racks that needed to be taken back to the plant in southern Georgia. He also discovered there were other factories along his route needing parts from southern Georgia, sending parts they assembled to others along his route or wanting their empty parts racks hauled.
Paul and Gail figured out a pick-up and delivery plan that would handle all the different manufacturing facilities in which parts or empty racks were picked up and delivered — all in a single day. Previously it had taken 2-3 days. They presented the plan to their carrier and customer, and the rest is history. Paul and Gail’s revenue increased, giving them a dedicated run with a constant payday each week, and providing the customer considerable savings.
Paul and Gail have had their ups and downs in the trucking business, but their dedication to each other and to the customers they serve shows why they are successful. Gail is the stay-at-home partner and has transferred her auditor skills to being the general manager of their trucking company. Even though Paul is leased to an expedited company, they operate as if they were still a motor carrier. They know what it costs them to operate: their break-even point, a realistic financial goal, and ways to cut costs.
Gail handles all the paper work: She puts each day’s load manifest together, bills out the previous day’s deliveries and makes sure all the truck’s paper work is correct and sent to the trucking company. And because Paul is on a dedicated run and can’t afford to be down for repairs during the week, he gives Gail the list of services to be completed on the following Saturday.
Paul leaves the house each morning around 6:30 and bobtails 20 miles to the plant in southern Georgia. He hooks up to his pre-loaded trailer and heads towards Atlanta, making three stops and dropping off racks of parts and picking up empty racks. The entire trip encompasses 12-14 hours, depending on traffic and delays. Paul’s last action before heading to the house is to back the trailer to a dock door and unhook.
Even though Gail is not teaming with Paul, he’s in constant contact with her throughout the day. She makes sure he has all the necessary paper work, and he leaves each morning with a breakfast sandwich, a packed lunch and that all-important Thermos of coffee.
Both in the truck
Charles and Diana Stilzner have been an owner-operator team for more than 30 years. Driving together as business partners and husband and wife was their intention from the very beginning. Charles had been in the military, driving heavy equipment. “When I finished active duty, my senior officer suggested I go apply for work at Barrett Moving & Storage,” he says. Initially Charles got on as a yard jockey moving trailers, then advanced to doing household moves. “In those days you put whatever fit in the truck. Barrett is a multifaceted trucking company where household moving is one part,” he says. “Three weeks ago we were in Boston and delivered a household, then hooked up to our flatbed and hauled oversized for Lockheed Martin, and now we’re hauling crates back to Ohio on the same flatbed. But our main trailer is a high-cube, climate-control where we haul art work, museum pieces; even the Moon Lander for the Johnson Space Center.”
Soon after Diana and Charles were married in 1978 (and they’ll tell you they were the first Charles and Diana, the real fairy tale marriage), Charles was in Florida loading when he fell and broke three ribs. Diana flew there and drove the truck while Charles healed. That’s when she decided that for their marriage to work, she needed to be working shoulder-to-shoulder with her husband. They both love to cruise the highway, so when the opportunity arose to get paid for cruising together, it was a no-brainer. When asked who does what, Diana says, “Charles picks the loads and how they’ll be routed, and I pay the bills and manage the bookkeeping. We share all the other duties — loading, tarping, inventorying, dealing with the unexpected breakdown, etc. We split driving down the middle. If I come across bad weather, accidents, or whatever during my shift, it’s my responsibility to deal with it, as it is his when he’s driving. It’s our responsibility to be sure the other gets the rest they need; our lives depend on it. He respects my ability to do anything required to operate this truck, and he trusts my decisions, as I do his.”
The Stilzners have taken the past 30 years’ experience and molded it into a lifestyle. They respect and trust each other, in both their personal relationship and business relationship. When I ask Charles how they divided up their duties, he responds, “I do what she tells me to do.”
I jokingly ask, “Does she do this with a rod or a whip?”
Charles’ response speaks volumes about their success: “She does it with kindness and determination.”
Like a marriage, a partnership trucking business is a commitment that requires dedication to make it work. Both the Stilzners and the Morrisons understand this, thriving for over 50 years combined as trucking couples. They both said the hardest part of trucking is that ‘mistress in the driveway.’ The biggest challenge is to schedule time to get away from the truck, not talk about the truck or its business.
In trucking, as in marriage and life, if you know where you are, where you need to go and have a plan, you’ll arrive at your destination, whether you’re delivering a load or traveling towards your goals.
Timothy D. Brady is an instructor for trucking business workshops through a partnership with a major university and local community college.

Collection of eighty-two 1939 Goudey Premiums representing all three different R303 Goudey Premium sets (two are complete, one is a partial set): 1) 1939 Goudey Premiums (R303-A) Partial Set (34 of 48): The R303-A set of 48 has by far always been the rarest of the three R303 sets. Missing just fourteen cards for completion (Appling, Case, Chapman, Dickey, Gomez, Keltner, Kreevich, Lombardi, Owen, Rich, Simmons, Vosmik, Warneke, and York). Keys: Averill (Vg-Ex), Cronin (Vg-Ex), Crosetti (Gd), DiMaggio (Ex), Feller (Vg-Ex), Foxx (Ex-Mt), Gehringer (Ex-Mt), Greenberg (Ex/Ex-Mt), Herman (Ex/Ex-Mt), Ott (N/Mt), Vaughan (Ex), and Ted Williams (two upper corners missing, otherwise Ex). The balance of cards grade as follows: seven cards range from Ex to Nr/Mt (averaging Ex-Mt), eight cards range from Vg to Vg-Ex, and seven lesser (downgraded for corners missing and/or scrapbook removal on the reverse). 2) 1939 Goudey Premiums (R303-B) Complete Set of 24 (black-and-white): 75% range from Ex to Nr/Mt (averaging Ex-Mt), and 25% slightly lesser. Keys: Appling (Ex-Mt), Cronin (Vg-Ex), Dickey (Ex-Mt), DiMaggio (Vg-Ex/Ex), Feller (Ex/Ex-Mt), Foxx (Vg-Ex), Gomez (Nr/Mt), Greenberg (Ex), Herman (Ex-Mt), Lombardi (Ex-Mt), Ott (stain in the upper left, otherwise Ex), Simmons (Ex-Mt), Vaughan (Ex/Ex-Mt). 3) 1939 Goudey Premiums (R303-B) Complete Set of 24 (sepia-toned): 85% range from Ex to Nr/Mt (averaging Ex-Mt), and 15% slightly lesser. Keys: Appling (Ex-Mt), Cronin (Ex-Mt), Dickey (Ex/Ex-Mt), DiMaggio (Vg-Ex/Ex), Feller (scrapbook removal on the middle of the top and bottom borders, and glue residue on the reverse, otherwise Ex), Foxx (Nr/Mt), Gomez (Ex-Mt), Greenberg (Ex/Ex-Mt), Herman (Fr), Lombardi (Ex-Mt), Ott (Ex), Simmons (Ex-Mt), Vaughan (Ex-Mt). This is a tremendous collection of R303-A and R303-B Goudey premiums, clean and crisp across the board, and it should be stressed that almost all have an Excellent or better appearance (many appear at a glance to be Near Mint to Mint, and those graded less than Ex have only an extremely minor flaw that is not immediately apparent, perhaps a tiny crease). Goudey premiums have received relatively little attention from collectors compared to traditional gum cards of the era, and a strong case can easily be made that they represent one of the best values of all 1930s baseball issues. This is an extremely impressive collection of 1939 Goudey gum-card premiums, the most complete collection we can ever recall offering, with many highlights, both in terms of condition and the remarkably high percentage of Hall of Famers and stars included. Total: 82 premiums. Reserve $1,000. Estimate $2,000/$3,000. SOLD FOR $4,406

About Robert
Robert has represented East Anglia since 1994
Robert was educated at Ashville College, Harrogate and trained in accountancy.
He built up a substantial family farming business, mainly in arable crops and he finds this practical experience invaluable in policy discussion in Parliament.
As being an MEP involves so much travelling from home to Brussels when he has time off he enjoys nothing more than helping out around the farm.
His passion for agriculture started young when he became County Chairman of the Young Farmers.
Active in the NFU, Robert held a number of appointments and chairmanships including Chairman of the Regional Livestock Committee and Sugarbeet, Potatoes and Cereals Committee and was involved in the WTO Uruguay round negotiations. It was this that led to his growing interest in international trade and the important role that agriculture plays within it.
Robert takes a keen interest in animal welfare and the environment and is a member of the RSPB and Vice-President of the Cambridgeshire Beekeepers Association. Robert is treasurer of the Land Use and Food Policy Intergroup and Chairman of the Sustainable Hunting Intergroup.
Robert got his first taste of politics at school, winning the public speaking trophy. Since then he has been a councillor and was a constituency chairman from1990-93.
Robert has represented East Anglia since June 1994 and is currently the Conservative member responsible for Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. In 1999 he was elected Deputy Chairman of the Conservatives in the European Parliament and held this position until 2001 when he decided that commitments of the European Foot and Mouth inquiry committee would take up most of his time.
He used his position as Conservative, and EPP-ED spokesman on Agriculture (1994-2001) and Rural Affairs (2001-2004) to lead the campaign to set up the first public inquiry into the epidemic.
Since becoming the ECR (European and Conservatives) Coordinator for International Trade, Robert has focussed his energies on holding the Commission to account. As this is an area where Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht negotiates on behalf of all EU member states he believes it is important that the British public’s interest is taken into account.
From the “Bra Wars” debacle, where thousands of Chinese textiles and bras were blocked in Europe’s ports, to Economic Partnership Agreements, which aim to put trade at the service of development, through the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, Robert works on trade issues that affect all of our lives. He is also a member of the EU-ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
In addition to his role in International Trade, Robert is also a substitute member of the Parliament’s Agriculture Committee. He follows both committees closely when they overlap with areas of his experience and expertise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A law regulating authorities' access to email drew a good deal of attention in Congress on Tuesday as a House panel quizzed Department of Justice and Google experts About it, and the Senate began taking on a bill to update the rules.
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), passed in pre-Web 1986, does not require government investigators to have a search warrant when requesting access to old emails and messages stored online, providing less protection for them than, say, letters stored in a desk drawer or even messages saved on a computer's hard drive.
Investigators can access technical information about emails with a subpoena, which has a lower legal threshold than a warrant because it does not involve a judge and therefore easier to obtain. A subpoena also can give access to emails that are more than 180 days old and sometimes newer emails if they are opened.
But tech companies including Google Inc recently started to object, refusing to disclose old messages without a warrant, as privacy advocates say digital messages should not be treated differently than physical private communication.
Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee and authored the original ECPA 27 years ago, on Tuesday introduced legislation to update the law by requiring a search warrant if the government wants to read emails stored with third-party providers.
A subpoena would still be enough for access to some technical data about the messages.
The bill also spells out a previously lacking requirement that government authorities notify the user whose emails are being disclosed and does away with distinction in legal standards based on the age of an email.
The elimination of distinctions based on how old communications are received backing from Elana Tyrangiel, acting assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, which interpreted the law for such differentiation.
"There is no principled basis to treat email less than 180 days old differently than email more than 180 days old," she told the a House judiciary panel on Tuesday.
"These 180-days, opened-unopened distinctions haven't kept pace with the way the technology is used today," she said.
Richard Littlehale of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations told the panel that more than anything, law enforcement authorities hope for a directive to third parties on how fast they should comply with proper legal requests for data - a divisive topic not addressed by Leahy's bill.
"Whatever the level of standard of proof, the thing that matters to us most ... is prompt response," Littlehale said.
At the same time, both government officials underscored that subpoenas are the norm for obtaining business records during corporate investigations.
Richard Salgado, law enforcement and information security director at Google, reiterated his company's refusal to honor subpoenas in either civil or criminal investigation..

Google Flights heralds Google’s formal entry into the travel meta-search arena. Much has been made of the absense of intermediaries such as online travel agencies and meta-search competitors in lieu of direct booking with the airlines. Unquestionably, the game has changed.
Since the announcement of Google’s acquisition of ITA Software, everyone knew it was going to be a game changer
The Fairsearch.org immediately reacted with a blog post asking if partners will be coerced into working with Google, if the new search technology will secure premium placement in search results, or if the content will be intermixed with search results. Valid questions. To which Google will undoubtedly reply with something along the line of “whatever provides the greatest utility to our users and yields the greatest benefits to our partners.”
As with all things Google, democratization of information and disruption of established business practices typically involves a balancing act between users and partners where the scale normally (and appropriately) tips toward the user’s end of the spectrum. Many partners understandably don’t like this and Google Flights will certainly be the poster child of the coming US Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights hearing.
For now, let’s forget about all that – there will be plenty of coverage in the coming weeks on the strategies, symbolism and voodoo surrounding Google’s deeper dive into travel. Much will be conjecture, lots will not be true, and some will be flat-out crazy.
One thing however, is for certain – Google Flight Search changes everything, but in more ways than you might think. It actually enables a very old school approach to searching air fares.
The Good, The Bad & The Ugly
Is Google Flights perfect? No, non-US/international itineraries are not supported. It also doesn’t present all those cool Hacker Fares Kayak finds.
For those predicting the demise of the OTAs, don’t be so quick. Earlier today, when booking a flight, Expedia found the cheapest itinerary, a UA-DL combination that was not identified by any other sites, including Kayak Travelocity, Priceline or Google Flights. Plus the price was $25 lower than any other comparable fares (although the last point may have been due to the location of Expedia’s servers on the West Coast.)
The concept of using a map to explore options based on budget and flight duration was worked out by Sabre Labs in the late ’90s and resulted in as Travelocity Dream Maps a few years later. It is questionable whether the Google Flights map should be presented as the default, especially because it occupies a lot of valuable screen real estate.
The map is nice for playing a joint round of “What-if” with both “where should we go?” and/or “when should we go?” as variables. It is a great experience to watch the fares change instantaneously as departure.return dates are changed. The only annoyance was having to close and reopen the map to get rid of the large “Popular Destination” tool tip that covers a large portion of the map as a default. The question is if most users are making where/when decisions when approaching Google Flights for the first time.
If one already knows their destination, is that much screen real-estate necessary, and does that little arc between the origin and destination really need to remind everyone the world isn’t flat? Sorry, but I doubt many people care if they can fly to Detroit for $151 when they have already entered their destination as Washington, DC. Inspiration is a noble goal, but integrating it in this way doesn’t simplify the process much.
Another minor mapping peeve is that when a flight includes stops, only the simplistic origin/destination arc is rendered, not smaller arcs between all connecting cities on the itinerary. Overall, when it comes to the mapping functionality in this version of Google Flights, the synopsis is: nice technology; low utility.
It was a good idea not to use the potentially disorienting Limits Scatter-graph as the default. The concept of using sliders in a graphical matrix to filter shorter and cheaper flights is nice, but the tight clustering and sporadic distribution of outlined and solid circles may create some confusion on first viewing. Once familiar with the content, most will simply use the sliders to highlight flights in the lower left corner of the graph.
Incorporating a hoverbox on mouseover into the Limits display would have been extremely helpful. A user could then immediately identify the targeted flight itinerary without needing to scan the list below. The current implementation requires the use to scan the results list even when the 2D scatter graph is visible. Simple sliders could have accomplished the same task, again, using less screen real estate.
There is plenty of other cool stuff – the calendar option lets one see a visual representation of the strategies employed by airlines for managing city-pair pricing. The outbound/return time sliders including departure & arrival times are nicely rendered, but far and beyond all other features is Google Flights blazing fast speed.
That said, there is incredibly powerful code underlying these tools – the key will be harnessing that power and unleashing it through an innovative user interface to make flight search more engaging and seamless.
From a content perspective, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America flight schedules are included, but pricing is not provided and no booking link is active. AirTran provides pricing, but again, the booking link is not available – the same goes for Frontier.
It is unclear if Google intends to enable integrated alternate day search capability, as the current iteration allows clicking forward & back by date. It may have been that in its initial version, the date paging was provided to simplify the UI and ensure page rendering speed was a key point of differentiation.
Google will need to do some retooling to compete with Kayak’s Hacker Fares. Kayak finds lower pricing or new itinerary combinations by linking two one-way itineraries to create a round-trip between airlines lacking ticketing agreements. As a result, two separate bookings are required. Google’s current limitation of one ad unit covering a complete roundtrip will probably need to be reworked to be competitive.
Hipmunk also has Google beat on pure graphic appeal. C’mon, all Google could muster was a generic airplane silhouette icon alongside the word “Flights” in a standard red font? Beyond the very cute mascot, Hipmunk has a clean & simple interface augmented by some clever agony filtering that eliminates irrelevant flight options. User experience is a critical factor that makes travel search much more of a challenge than basic web search. The current feel of Google Flights is a lot like Google Analytics – and that may not suit the typical leisure traveler.
It also seemed that Google Flights handled certain carriers somewhat sporadically. For some reason, Delta itineraries seemed to be most problematic.
Most OTA and meta-search user experiences are also superior to Google Flights – particularly because there are more itineraries listed on the page above the fold – especially with the map is displayed. On my display, only four outbound Google Flights are presented above the fold; the figure increases to 11 with the map collapsed. In comparison, Kayak displays five, Expedia offers 12 cells within its matrix, Travelocity offers a 15 cell matrix, and Orbitz, 24 cells. In my survey, Hipmunk, with its Time-bars, reigns as champion with a list numbering 28. Priceline is the laggard, displaying only three and lacking a matrix. This puts Google at the low end of the spectrum.
Now for Something Completely Different
So you already test drove Google Flights and passed judgement for better or worse, right?
Hold on – you might want to take a look at this little trick that foreshadows the inevitable Google Flights API.
Guess What? The Google Flights text-based query string works really well for quick & dirty air searches.
Click on this link as see what I mean:;f=ORD,MDW,MKE;t=WAS;d=2011-11-14;r=2011-11-17;a=AA,CO,WN,UA;c=DFW,IAH;s=1;olt=0,900;itt=840,1440
Is it fast? Hell yes. And there is no map pushing the search results below the fold.
That’s Cool.
But that’s not all, go into your browser bar and start manipulating the text string. Using Google Chrome, with Google Instant, the search results simply appear – even without clicking or hitting the enter key… Even when changing origin or destination airports.
That’s Magic.
The search query is easily broken down – here are the key elements (based on the query above): | The website URL
f=ORD,MDW,MKE | Origin Airport(s) (from)
t=WAS | Destination Airport(s) (to)
d=2011-11-14 | Departure Date (depart)
r=2011-11-17 | Return Date (return)
a=AA,CO,WN,UA | Air Carrier(s)(airline)
c=DFW,IAH | Connection Cities (connect)
s=1 | Maximum Stops (stops)
olt=0,900 | Outbound Landing Time Range – Min-Max in minutes from 0:00 (outbound landing – arrival time range)
itt=840,1440 | Inbound Takeoff Time Range – Min-Max in minutes from 0:00 (inbound takeoff – departure time range)
Each element is isolated by a semi-colon. If particular search attributes are not needed (at a minimum, keep the dates and origin/destination,) leave them out.
For experienced travelers who are familiar with airport codes, this may represent the industry’s fastest possible way to search for flights. The only tricky part will be the flight time calculations, but the sliders may be used if deemed easier. The outbound and inbound time attributes can both be altered for departure or landing times and are based on minutes, so be prepared to practice dividing by 60.
Try it – using Chrome. Awesome, isn’t it? It beats the page back / new search / or filtering options normally required on traditional airline, OTA or meta-search sites for raw speed & flexibility. You may experience the same code-driven rush as a travel agent typing into a green screen in the 1970′s. The speed is addictive.
Finally, before anyone starts getting too bent out of shape, Google has not (yet) embedded Google Flights into the organic search results page. A search of “Flights” today returned ten standard links to Expedia, Travelocity, Kayak, CheapTickets, Priceline, Hotwire, Orbitz, JetBlue, American and TripAdvisor in that order. Not that Google is completely ignoring the new functionality – Flights appears as a menu item in the left sidebar whenever the keywords Flight or Flights are entered, but not when the terms air, airfare, airline, plane tickets, etc. are entered.
At least for the present, Bing gives its air meta-search a much higher profile within its organic search results – including origin/destination and date inputs.
I am guessing Google’s approach may change in the future based on advertising click-through rates or when profile information is integrate profile information and retaining values from recent searches, for example the origin airport and dates. It would be logical for Google to follow Bing’s lead.
When Google fits together the pieces of the puzzle, this will be a platform to be reckoned with… just as everyone expected. I don’t recall anyone predicting the lightening-fast search results – and this is just the first release. Just wait until those smart Googlers and ITAers start tuning the application for speed in future revisions…
So in the interim, before Google launches international itinerary search, tweaks its algorithm and UI to present Hacker Fares, suppresses the map, introduces an API, or at least spruces up the branding on the flight search page, have fun relishing the speed and elegance of the old-school travel search technique proven by thousands of traditional travel agents on green-screens for decades – the simple paste & edit text entry.

Post by Chris Mellor (thank you) over at El Reg. Finally the HAMR hits
Seagate has demonstrated heat-assisted magnetic recording technology with 1 trillion bits per square inch, a 30 per cent improvement in Toshiba’s production record of 744Gbit/in2with its MQ01ABD drive – a 2.5-inch, 5400rpm, SATA II drive.
Seagate’s highest production areal density is thought to be the 3TB Barracuda, a 3-platter drive with a 620Gbit/in2 areal density. The company says: “The bits within a square inch of disk space, at the new milestone, far outnumber stars in the Milky Way, which astronomers put between 200 billion and 400 billion.”
All current drives use perpendicular magnetic recording technology (PMR), which was introduced in 2006. As HDD manufacturers try to squeeze more data onto the disk platters’ recording surfaces, the bit size in successive generations of this technology shrinks. It is predicted the bits will become increasingly unstable and not hold data properly at the 1Tbit/in2 level and beyond with PMR technology.
In the quest to have smaller bit sizes with stable magnetic charge two main technologies are being investigated. Bit-patterned media (BPM) puts an insulating ring around each bit to stop neighbouring bits influencing its magnetic charge. Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) uses magnetic material that is more resistant to having its magnetic polarity changed unless it is heated. A heating laser is added to the disk’s read-write head to accomplish the short burst of heating needed to write data to a HAMR bit.
The chart below shows the currently known hard disk drive (HDD) supplier maximum areal densities, together with Seagate’s trillion bit areal density.

So came a yorker so fiercely like a tracer bullet that made a deep impact on the stumps. And the scoreboard read “India – Out Bowled Pakistan”.
So out of the blue, BCCI has allowed a bi-lateral series against Pakistan. Bravo! This was just needed where we as a country stand for Brotherhood in spite of being shown Bandooks times immemorial. For God’s sake it is we who are angry and need to be pacified, not them. A complete straight walk has been given to PCB by BCCI in spite of Pakistan’s rejected accountability for the heinous acts, claims of innocence and where their own court rejects its own 26/11 panel report. I doubt if there is any back door deal striking place; you nab the culprits, punish them and in return we will play cricket with you. BCCI is playing cricket at the expense of country’s sentiments.
Cricket is a gentleman’s game and thus we also need gentleman’s in its administration. But sadly all we have is politicians, businessman but rarely a gentleman. This is the 21st century cricket where Politics and Cricket are joined by hips and cannot be separated especially when it comes to India and Pakistan. The question that needs an immediate answer is: Since there was no cricket being played in the aftermath of Mumbai attack then what was the need to start playing again since neither the perpetrators of the attack have been punished nor found guilty by Pakistan. One may say that sport should be kept away from politics but on the other hand we use it to ease the tension and act as everything is normal.
Why is it that we are all charged up watching the Indo-Pak cricket match? It is that anguish, distress, state of abhorring that it brings along. Be it on the cricket field and on both the sides of LOC. It boils down to” izzat ka sawal”. But this emotions cannot bring the perpetrators to book. Neither can they stop the act of terror affecting other neighbours. It is sad to see that instead of going all out to wipe out terrorism both the nations either start or stop playing cricket and use cricket as a bait to pacify one another. Strange but true. I must say our government shows high level of optimism with regard to cricket being used as balm to ease tension.
Now since we are hosting Paksitan all I hope is that cricket goes on between the nations irrespective of the tension as it is simply a sport and not a political event garnering eyeballs.

Emily was knocked to the ground by the person with a gun and he laid on top of her. "Shh... Stay down." He told her and, for once in her life, she actually listened. That was, until, the man started shooting blindly. Emily shoved the man off her and crawled forward to the maniac. At the last second, without realising what the hell she was doing, she tackled him to the ground and began wrestling him. 'You stupid, arrogant little twerp!' She put all her weight down on him; which wasn't much and held him down by his wrists. 'What the hell do you think you're doing!? Huh!?'

Deep in the rural woods of Maine, the visage of a once celebrated mental institution stands. The memory of this building has faded, having seemingly been closed down in the 1960s to those old enough to know its name but not exactly remember what it stands for. The brick of the walls is dusty, and the gardens surrounding the massive estate are gloomy. An air of despair fills the lungs of any who dare to breathe it and chokes them on the hatred permeating from the building. Surrounded by miles and miles of forest and shrubbery, most know naught of its existence. Those that do are housed within its unforgiving walls : stagnant nurses, eccentric and almost as insane as their patients doctors, not completely there inmates. Only the most crazed of the mentally unstable are granted entrance here and once past the foreboding gates are never granted exit - except through death. Those admitted are soon forgotten by the outside world, their legal documents seemingly vanishing. This place's name is Lockwood's Institution of Mental Health, and for the last forty to fifty years it has been a hell for those that inhabit it.
Legally Lockwood's has been shut down for decades, but underneath the guise of well-being and health, it has been running under the radar since the 1960s.Only by word of mouth is it spread and the most dastardly of evil and unstable sent there and as quickly as those learn about it, they forget. Some don't even seem to remember having a son or daughter, sister or brother - the idea vanishes from their minds. Something sinister is happening, has been happening at Lockwood's for years, and the patients, too insane to understand, the nurses, too brainwashed to care, the doctors, the ones experimenting, doing. Ghastly torture, waterboarding, swift execution to those deemed unable to further the doctors' research any farther, it is a modern day Holocaust with no preference on the race of its victims. An inmate has been there for a year, however, and somehow knows something is not right. The ability to do something is beyond them, however ; they cannot work alone to take down a sinister organizaion of mentally deranged doctors whom have been performing their own experiments on live patients illegally. Not only that, but they are not all there themselves - the reason they were sent to Lockwood in the first place. A new inmate is coming in, however, and this person might be the former's partner-in-crime - to bring down Lockwood.
__
In short, it's a roleplay about a mental institution housing the batshit crazy doctors 'treating' the batshit crazy patients. The two inmates (us) attempt to work together to find a way out of Lockwood's, but their own mental instabilities will most likely hinder them in the process. I plan for it to get pretty dark (torture, right? gotta be dark) so the roleplay will be mature, but I don't plan on having anything sexual in it, although that may be debatable if it progresses in that way. This roleplay can either be FxF, MxF, or possibly - possibly - MxM. I'm not very good at the last, but I'd like to branch out and try new things. If I'm absolute shit at it, we can at least say we had a good run, right? I'm wanting the roleplay to be at least high casual, possibly advanced. I love detail and vivid imagery, but that doesn't mean you have to be Ernest Hemingway. I know I'm not Flannery O'Connor. Mistakes here and there are fine, we all make them. In fact, my s on my keyboard is pretty broken at the moment, so I may make a few oopsies that way.
I'd like a two paragraph minimum, because I rarely write under that. I don't care what gender you are behind the computer screen, or what gender you roleplay. I just want you to be literate and polite, and I'll be the same. Of course, my plot needs ironing out, but I'm pretty firm on the insane asylum thing. As for your character, the weirder, more bizarre, brutal mental problem the better. I know mine will be pretty out there, hopefully, and I want yours to be too. All said and done, I'm not a slave driver. Take your time writing - I take quality over the amount of replies you're able to shoot out in a day. If you're interested, please shoot me a PM, and answer the following, if you will. (:
*would you like to add anything to the plot? take away?
*do you do cs's? if so, how detailed? real pictures or no, if you use them at all?
These questions are for you. I don't mind whichever way you answer because the roleplay is supposed to be about us, not one of us, and compromising is a part of that. ^^

“Until we are sure that we can clear the capital requirement, it’s difficult to make a decision to use large amounts of capital. (Japanese businesses) are now actively investing overseas on the back of a stronger yen, but financial institutions are unlikely to rush to join the trend,” he said.Under the Basel III framework to be phased in from 2013, banks are required to have a common equity capital ratio of at least 7 percent and those deemed posing systemic risks will be imposed an additional 1 to 2.5 percent surcharge.Nagayasu’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley in 2008 when Wall Street firms were battered by market turmoil following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Earlier this month, MUFG issued a statement expressing support of Morgan Stanley, in which the Japanese bank is the largest shareholder with a 22.4 percent stake.The statement came as Morgan Stanley shares took a dive amid persistent rumours that it has an oversized exposure to troubled Eurozone banks.Nagayasu said the statement was not something requested by Morgan Stanley.”The market was very volatile and the focus of selling was shifting from Bank of America to Morgan Stanley. We thought it was better to send a message,” he said.”(U.S.) bank earnings will start soon and the speculative market storm will die down then. Suspicions tend to rise before that,” he said.

We’ve already discussed the idea of selecting a tight end early in your fantasy draft (click here to view), but if you decide not to target Rob Gronkowski or Jimmy Graham or are hit by injuries to your starter you could easily find yourself searching for a sleeper. Who could emerge as a viable option that others in your league may not be looking at?
One option is the Minnesota Vikings’ Kyle Rudolph, a player who I think is a prime sleeper candidate.
He posted decent numbers in his rookie season, with 26 receptions for 249 yards and 3 TD. You look at those numbers and his three years at Notre Dame (never more than 33 receptions, 364 yards or 3 TD) and you may wonder why there is any reason to be excited.
First of all, it’s rare for college tight ends to post big numbers in the passing game. It’s just not a position that is generally utilized the same way as in the pros. Just for comparison Coby Fleener, who was the first tight end drafted in 2012, never exceeded 34 receptions in college (he did post 667 yards in 2011 and 17 total TD over his final two seasons). However, it just shows that the receptions cannot be taken fully into account.
Secondly, he clearly became a bigger red zone target as the season progressed, with all of his touchdowns coming in the final seven weeks of the season.
If those aren’t good enough reasons to at least have him on your radar, his role in the offense has clearly changed. No longer will he be behind Visanthe Shiancoe on the depth chart (as he is no longer on the Vikings roster). Shiancoe was fourth on the Vikings in receptions (36) and yards (409) a year ago and also had 3 TD. While all of those looks won’t go to Rudolph, at least some of them will.
You also have the injury to Adrian Peterson, which will open up opportunities for others (most notably Toby Gerhart, but you have to wonder if they will throw a little bit more in the red zone) and Christian Ponder should be opening the season as the team’s quarterback. Both of those just further help things point in Rudolph’s direction as he could easily factor as a safety valve for the young quarterback.
Rudolph is listed at 6’6”, 258 lbs., which makes him an ideal candidate in the red zone. At 22-years old he has likely just skimmed the surface of his potential. The Vikings are going to open the season with him as their TE1 and, with all of the other factors, it makes him a very intriguing TE2 with the potential to be a low-end TE1 by year’s end. It wouldn’t surprise me to see him score 8+ TD, so make sure he has your attention in all formats.
What are your thoughts of Rudolph? Is he a player that you think has sleeper potential? Why or why not?
Make sure to check out our 2012 fantasy football rankings:
In mock drafts, I have been eyeing Kyle Rudolph as a sleeper TE2 selection. I have been careful not to draft him often so as not to let the cat out of the bag, but to make a long story short, I agree with your assessment!

MotoGP: An Interview with Daniel Pedrosa. One Year To Win
In 2004, Dani Pedrosa became the youngest ever 250cc World Champion, and after a second title in his second year, he prestiged to the elite class of MotoGP. 116 starts later, he has accumulated 71 podiums and 22 wins in the premier class, but at the risk of facing the unwanted title of the best rider to never win a World Championship. However, in 2012 he took the fight to Jorge Lorenzo but was just short of the crown after an early crash in Australia. Lorenzo took the title but Pedrosa will hope to not be disheartened and continue his strong run of form into next season, but with increased competitiveness, it will be a much greater feat, but if anyone can do it, Pedrosa must fancy himself. A unique characteristic about Dani Pedrosa is that he stands at a measly 1.58m, or 5 feet 2 inches, and is not only the shortest, but the lightest at 51kg. Regardless of all this, he is still one of the brightest talents and at 27, he will believe this could be his year and I was lucky enough to be able to ask him some questions.

DT: How do you feel 2012 went for you?
DP: Pretty good, successful and I also enjoyed it a lot and had fun with the bike. The whole season – with my team and all my fans, it was a good year!
DT: Do you feel it was a vast improvement from 2011?
DP: Obviously, just from the point I wasn’t injured!
DT: What were the main differences for you between 2011-12?
DP: The fact I wasn’t injured was a huge factor and I think this is clear for all to see.
DT: Do you think that 2013 will be your Championship year?
DP: I’m really not sure. For sure this is the goal we are working towards, I have the will to make it happen and of course the confidence
DT: How much more competitive will 2013 be, with Rossi returning to Yamaha?
DP: It’s hard to say at the moment, so far we’ve seen him riding fast but we don’t know how this will be during the year if he will progress more or not, but I’m sure he will be fighting near the top
DT: What have you learnt as yourself as a rider and a person throughout last season?
DP: Last season was a little different for me as I relaxed more at the races, I had a more open relationship with my mechanics and my team and all the people around me. I experienced the season in a more relaxed manner and it felt good, I was able to enjoy it more. From the riding point of view, I learnt not to be in such a hurry. In previous years I have always been injured and so I found myself behind the points in the Championship and also physically behind, as I wasn’t fit, so to have some time to ride like I want to and not always ‘chasing’ was a good feeling
DT: Do you think that Marc can challenge for the title as well?
DP: I think so, he has shown he is very competitive so we will see
Dani Pedrosa of Spain rides along during the Sepang Test of the 2013 MotoGP Season with his Repsol Honda HRC RC213V
DT: Who would you consider as your main rival for this season?
DP: Obviously Jorge, he’s clearly strong enough and very consistent
DT: Which rider would you say is the most complete rider on the grid?
DP: Again, at the moment, Jorge
DT: Which parts of your riding do you feel you need to improve on?
DP: Last year I made some steps, but there is always something to improve in mid-corner and braking
DT: Lastly, who do you think will be the surprise package of 2013?
DP: I’m really not sure, it’s too early to say. It depends how you look at it because it’s not a ‘surprise’ that Marc is fast or Valentino is competitive again for the people ‘inside’ racing because we know their talent. I would say the surprise may come from one of the satellite riders, but at the moment, I don’t know who!

<|endofexample|>
from Milk Teeths The ultimate style+travel photo, and I liked that blouse so much I bought it from her store!
I generally aim for a high degree of original content on this blog, but I really enjoyed rounding up my favourite summer outfits from some of my favourite bloggers in September, and couldn't resist doing an autumn roundup too. However, I've gone a bit overboard, so I'm splitting this post in two. This week you get the vibrant colours and sunny days outfits that most inspired me, next week a few more from the more wintry side of autumn. Since I featured my winter coat last post, and am basically wearing it all the time now, I guess autumn is truly over, in London at least...
I Want Your Dress:
from Yeye! Style Blog and Resplendent Tranquility
This was the year the Alexa Chung collection for Madewell had us all pining for black velvet dresses with little collars. Seeing Izzie's vintage example, I was inspired to spend hours of my life trawling Etsy for weeks, instead of spending too much money, and I'm very happy with the result. I also love her styling of it.
You can't see it well in the picture, but Emily from Resplendent Tranquility's dress has a pattern of chickadees! How perfect for autumn. I skulked around in H&M for quite a while in search of this, but fortunately for my budget they didn't have my size. And I could never have mustered up such a perfect location for it anyway!
Coloured Denim:
from Orchid Grey and My Little Fashion Diary
After I bought my red Zara jeans I was pleased to see other bloggers following me on the coloured denim idea! ; ) Joking aside, red and yellow are probably the best autumn colours around, and I love the difference in the way they've been styled: sort of grunge-folk on Julie and classic all the way on Emilie. And both with truly great shoes...
Caitlin in Yellow
from Waking Life
I honestly think Caitlin from Waking Life is one of the most stylish girls in blogland, and she made me doubly despairing of my own dressing abilities all fall by consistently wearing my favourite colour so perfectly. If you don't know her blog already, you should: head over for one perfectly put together look after another, and most of them taken before she goes to work, which just boggles my mind!
I Just LIke These Ones:
from Waking Life and Birds Closet
More perfect looks with oatmeal and red, and also demonstrating that sometimes hair is the best accessory. Well, hair and a swallow-shaped brooch, if you can swing it.
Keeping Cozy:
from Wish Wish Wish and Hannah and Landon
Carrie's yellow coat set me back ages in my own coat shopping. I couldn't come to grips with the fact that I wasn't going to find the very one and make it mine.
Hannah's sweater looks warm too, but what really keeps me cozy is the picture itself. Taken during Canadian Thanksgiving, it reminded me in all the best possible ways of my favouritest of favourite holidays.
Any favourites among these? Or what were your favourite colours/looks this fall?
49 comments:
Love finding new blogs. Thanks for pointing me toward Waking Life. I can't wait to check it out.
Also the last pic/ensemble from Hannah and Landon is possibly my favorite.
Leaving the House in THIS?!?!

Great photos! I love the first one especially :)
Great selection and a couple of these blogs I hadn't even come across yet! I am going to check these out right now :)
I love the yellows red and oatmeals although strangely I have gone off on a pastel trip just recently.. maybe I am trying to blend in with the fog?
That is a nice looking pick up van.
ooh, I like the oatmeal & braids.
I've been searching for a pair of red jeans, but by the time I find the ones that fit the way I want, the trend is likely to be over.
I love Autumn pictures. Great pictures. :)
i need to crack onto this mustard yellow! i love it. xx
Totally agree - loving colored denim right now!
~jess

i love this post! some of the outfits you've selected are gorgeous - i especially love carries yellow coat too :) x
aw, thanks for including me!! you're awesome. i have a yellow coat quite like carrie's but I got it three years ago at nordstrom and it is looking a little worse for wear. you know i love yellow :)
You've picked some girsl with amazing autumnal style! I love all the earthy tones and beautiful yellows.!
Love your picks. I am such a huge Bird's Closet fan that it's not even funny!
Aw, thanks for including me in your autumn inspiration round up :) I wore that chickadee dress yesterday. Gosh, I loooove it. That's a bummer you weren't able to find it. They put out a blouse version, too. The print is a wee bit smaller, but just as sweet.
Red and yellow are such perfect autumn colors. I like all these photos very much! I'll definitely be doing some new blog visiting as a result of this post.
I think we have the same preferences, I like all the pictures you chose with their colours and outfits.
@ Emily: I might go back and see if any hit the sales racks! I didn't fancy the blouse so much... I'm such a dress girl!
i love all the looks, but im especially digging the mustard pants - i've really been wanting a pair myself!
all of the mustard yellow looks are great!! that color happens to look terrible on me, but it's perfect when i can incorporate it into an accessory or pair of shoes.
Those are some very cute looks that you've rounded up. I think my favorites are the last two photos. I love the yellow jacket paired with the brown polka dot dress - those aren't colors I would usually put together but they looked wonderful that way. I would wear the outfit next to her in a heartbeat. I too am often really inspired by my fellow bloggers, and we all appreciate the recognition, which is why I wanted to say "thank you" for stopping by my blog and leaving a message!
Love,
Heather
agreed! red and yellow are two of the best autumn colours, together with dark green I may add :)
my favourite from these: Carrie, Emily and Orchid Grey!
The polka dot is my best pick - of course I will take that yellow coat too...
Colorful outfits!!!
So nice of you to introduce other bloggers in your blog!!! :)

Gatland has warned his stars based in France and England that they will not be selected for his squad if they cannot secure full availability for the tournament.
He is preparing his side for their meeting with Australia at the Millennium Stadium on December 3, but the New Zealander is without France-based trio James Hook, Mike Phillips and Lee Byrne, plus Exeter prop Craig Mitchell and Sale duo Andy Powell and Dwayne Peel as the game falls outside the International Rugby Board's designated Test window.
That means clubs are not obligated to release their players for international duty and, although only scrum-half Phillips would have been a definite starter against the Wallabies, Gatland has made it clear that if players are not available for the start of Six Nations preparations, they risk finding themselves on the outside looking in.
Gatland said: "We knew the English and French-based players would not be available because this game is outside that IRB window.
"But we have said before, and we have been pretty consistent in this situation, that if those players in France and England can't get full release for the Six Nations then they will not be selected in the squad.
"We have been disappointed to hear that a couple of them had verbal agreements but it is not written in their contracts, which I sat down with them and told them to do.
"So the warning out there is that if you are going to leave Wales, make sure you have full release for all Wales games and squad sessions in your contract because if you don't you are not going to be selected, and it is a bit of a concern for us going forward."
Gatland also has a series of injury headaches to contend with prior to the re-match with Australia, who beat Wales 21-18 when the sides met in the third-place play-off at the World Cup.
Eight of Gatland's original 28-man squad joined the camp carrying problems, including George North (groin), Rhys Priestland (shoulder), Luke Charteris (wrist), Jamie Roberts (knee) and Dan Lydiate (ankle).
Gatland remains hopeful that his World Cup stars will recover in time, but one man who will not be available is Ospreys prop Adam Jones.
The formidable tighthead has suffered a recurrence of the calf problem that brought his World Cup semi-final to an early end, and has been replaced in the squad by uncapped 20-year-old Scarlets' forward Rhodri Jones.
With Mitchell unavailable and Paul James (thumb) another injury absentee, Gatland currently has Gethin Jenkins, Ryan Bevington and Scott Andrews as his other front-row options.
"Adam is not going to be available for us so we will replace him with another prop," Gatland said. "Scott Andrews has not played a lot of rugby and we have a lot of time for Scott.
"But we understand the pressure regional coaches are under, it's about performance and results but as a young tighthead he needs to play.
"He is going to learn a couple of lessons and have a couple of hidings in games, but in three or four years we could have another outstanding tighthead on our hands and we will need to work hard at creating some depth in that position."
There was some positive news for Gatland after assistant coach Rob Howley signed a new contract to remain as part of the national set-up until 2016.
The announcement follows last week's confirmation that Shaun Edwards had also agreed a new deal to take him through to the 2015 World Cup. Both Edwards and Howley will also work with Wales' age-grade sides.
Fellow backroom team members Neil Jenkins and Robin McBryde, who were WRU employees prior to Gatland's appointment in 2007, remain in place, with the latter's contract due to run out at the end of the season.
The notable omission from the squad was 104-cap fly-half Stephen Jones, who missed out with Ospreys number 10 Dan Biggar earning a recall.
But Gatland insists the decision does not mean the end of Jones' 13-year Test career, pointing out that the 33-year-old Scarlets' playmaker has not announced his retirement, unlike wing Shane Williams who steps down after the Wallabies' fixture.
"Stephen has not been selected but there are a couple of others (from the World Cup squad) not selected," he said.
"He hasn't retired, we know exactly what he offers us and this is a chance to give someone else an opportunity.

Build it Tall
What that means, of course, is that we size the throat and flue bigger as we would for the 60" Rumford. Build the fireplace according to the plan at - 20" deep, with the 42" Vestal damper and 20"x20" flue - only build the firebox 48" wide instead of 60" wide.
One customer's saga getting a 36" wide by 42" tall Rumford built correctly.
Make it Look Tall
The first tall fireplace we designed was a small 30" wide Rumford that the client wanted to be 48" tall like a MacIntosh-inspired coal-burning fireplace they had seen. We pulled it off by building it as a narrow 48" Rumford but our first idea was to fake it by building a 30" by 30" Rumford with an inner hearth raised 18", recessed about an inch, painted black and fitted with a grille to make it looks like a coal grate in a 48" tall fireplace.
We have seen other fireplaces that were made to look tall. See an example and another.
We are in the process of building-designing a Rumford. The owner would like the opening to be 48 wide by 60 high. I was planning on using the precast throat and smoke chamber and also the stainless damper. We were wondering if using two 12 inch round flues would be sufficient? I am worried that the height of the opening is to high. We are planning on using a clay chimney pot on top for design. One on each flue. The total height of the chimney is going to be about 30 ft.
The owner would also like tumbled-old looking firebrick. We are going to lay them in a herringbone pattern.
Please email me back so I can figure this out.

We used to worry about making fireplaces with extremely tall openings work. Our Rumfords are designed to have square openings - as tall as they are wide. But then we reasoned that we have no trouble making a 60" wide fireplace work even if it's 60" tall. Why should we worry about a 48" wide fireplace that's 60" tall? Just think of it as a narrow big fireplace rather than a tall small fireplace.
What that means, of course, is that we size the throat and flue bigger as we would for the 60" Rumford. Build your fireplace according to the plan at - 20" deep, with the 42" Vestal damper and 20"x20" flue, only build the firebox 48" wide instead of 60" wide.
As you can guess I don't think your idea of using two 12" round flues will work. Two flues are never as good as one flue the right size. See You need more like the 300 square inches of flue area provided by the 20"x20" flues rather than the 200 square inches and all the unnecessary surface area and turbulence you would get with two round 12" flues.
We have some firebrick options shown at Any of them could be chipped up or "tumbled", I suppose. Usually we get complaints about the quality of the firebrick so, if you want tumbled, our dealers will probably have such a deal for you. Using anything but firebrick for the firebox is legal and safe enough if the firebox thickness is increased in accordance with code but the non-firebrick will probably crack and spall with thermal shock so prepare your customer or you'll be back every few weeks or so replacing yet another brick or stone. See comments at
We have a few large chimney pots that will fit the 20"x20" flue. See Or you could set two smaller pots on ether side of the real flue. And you could use four smaller pots to construct a "cluster" of four pots that would actually be one big pot. See

Home TeleportDiscuss9
on this wiki
Redirected from Lumbridge Home Teleport
Home Teleport is a Magic spell released on 27 September 2006 available to all players. It is a teleport to any lodestone that the player has activated. When the spell is selected, players are prompted to choose their destination. When right-clicking the Home Teleport spell it gives an option to teleport to the last lodestone that was used.
RequirementsEdit
Home teleport has no level requirements in order to be used, allowing players who are low leveled or have had their stats drained access to it. In order to access all the locations on the lodestone network, some additional requirements must be met in order to initially unlock the destination.
UsageEdit
Casting the spell takes about ten seconds, and can be interrupted by combat. It also cannot be used while in the combat stance. Like most teleport spells, the spell cannot be cast beyond level 20 Wilderness. The spell can be cast repeatedly, without any cooldown period between casts.
LocationsEdit
- See also: Lodestone Network
Home teleport allows travel to a number of locations. Once a player has unlocked them, the home teleport spell can be used to travel to that location. Lodestones are located in the following areas:
Solomon's General StoreEdit
With the release of Solomon's General Store on 17 July 2012, there are alternative animations players may buy with runecoins to play instead of the current animation.
HistoryEdit
Home teleport was originally introduced on 27 September 2006 in the Skill Tutors update.[1] The spell was added to all available spellbooks.[2] A player could cast the spell to return to Lumbridge (normal spellbook), Burthorpe (normal spellbook), Edgeville (Ancient Magicks), or Lunar Isle (Lunar Magicks). When first introduced, the spell required a 30 minute cooldown between teleports. This was removed in a hidden update on 28 March 2011.
TriviaEdit
-.
- If you eat food while using home teleport, you'll appear as if normally standing. The spell, however, will continue.
- If you try to teleport with a normal teleport spell while you are using a home teleport, there will be a message saying: You can't do that while invisible.

Yesterday morning, I ran along the banks of Burke Lake. I followed a route that took me through the woods, over tree roots, and through a few cobwebs that had grown overnight. I jogged past the main marina, where young men in maroon shirts, hair tousled and shoes untied, set out canoes and rowboats for tourists and Fairfax County locals to rent throughout the slow Sunday. Just like the prior Sunday morning, notes from the Eagles “Take it Easy” rang out from a boom box, and I grinned at the old music and the rising sun. As I grinned, one of the maroon-clad kids grinned back at me, and bid me good morning.
“Great morning for a run!” He hurled a Frisbee through the air and a cool breeze caught it and sent it over flying overhead.
“It sure is!” I replied, slowing to a walk.
I reflected on the Frisbee and the music and the meaning of it all as I stopped at my water fountain, and yep, it is my water fountain as much as it is anyone else’s. It seems special to me, because it’s saved me from the heat and the pain of all the miles I run so many mornings, afternoons, and darkening twilights, but I share it with thousands of others and that makes me feel connected to untold strangers and a few friends too.
The same small black ants from last week and last year and the years long since passed crawled over the silver metal as I pushed the wide thick button and poured water into my yellow, plastic water bottle with the side compartment for my keys. They really aren’t the same ants but they look the same each time, and I wonder why generations of ants inhabit the same place, just like a new generation of young men catching Frisbees behind their backs listen to the music I first discovered on a sunny summer morning more than two decades ago. The mountain creek-cold water flows into my cup and I lean over and swallow water as fast as I can, and I pause to splash it on my face, which has turned pink from the exertion and from the extra pounds I am carrying on my middle-aged frame.
Before I keep running, I take a deep breath and try to inhale the moment, to capture it forever in my mind like a photograph that includes sound and smell and feel. It’s impossible to both live in this moment, already past, and to inhabit both past and future, but I try. The lake is blue, and the sunrise hails a glorious future, and the young men, so young, will grow older and one day, they will bring their own children to this place, and the Eagles will be playing from someone else’s radio, and a new generation of tiny black ants will crawl on the water fountain.
And who knows? Perhaps they will see a little old lady, clasping the hands of her boisterous grandchildren as they race toward the water, still blue, and they will remember the way they were. And then, with a sigh and a smile, they will nod at me and we’ll gaze into the stiller waters that reflect what we have, and still could, become. The circle of life has neither beginning nor end. Like each one of us, it is complete.
Awwww, I love this! Sniff!
Thank you so much my friend!!
That was beautiful!
Thank you so much P.j.!!

Grinning, Doug. Your post yesterday also resonated with me.
So lovely! I was right there with you.
Thank you so much Christine! xo
Breathtaking words!
Thank you so much!!
It’s awesome you’re out there for a run. I’m having a hard time getting back into a routine after completely over indulging all summer. Middle age has it’s challenges. I fancied your post both because it’s well written and your photo’s. We lived at a lake for 25 years and I miss the view’s at times.
Aw thank you so much, my friend! As far as routines . . . sometimes it’s easier for me to dip my toe into the proverbial water instead of thinking I gotta fall all the way into the deep water, you know?
Sigh–re the 25 years by the lake. The lake pictured above is 5 min. from my home and the waters calm me.
So good to see you!
This sounds like one of those rare, beautiful moments where you manage to be in the moment, absolutely, completely, while also feeling that bubble of emotion in your gut that signals a nostalgic memory as well as that odd, undefinable something that is a kind of reverse-nostalgia about the future. I hope all your runs are this lovely.
Yes–yes!! You’re one of the only people who has ever written about that weird nostalgia, or wistfulness, for things that have never been (but might become)! Thank you so much, my friend! And my runs are all over the place, but even the tough ones offer moments that I either can treasure or can learn from.
So good to see you here!
Can I just say….extra pounds my happy azz!!
I loved this, it is always wonderful to see the circle of life played out before our eyes isn’t it.

Why Is Tori Spelling Proud of Her Pregnant Bikini Body? [AUDIO]
Actress and author Tori Spelling called in to “On Air with Ryan Seacrest” on Monday to talk about teaming with Lunchables for the “Never Bored Again” campaign, comments on the “Bump Proud” photo, and shares her beauty expertise on stretch marks.
Tori Spelling Talks About Being A ‘Fertile Myrtle’
On The ‘Bump Proud’ Photo:
“It was the funniest response that I got so many people commenting on how a pregnant woman shouldn’t be showing all of that. Im like: ‘Showing what?’ Just because my stomach sticks out further than another woman in a bikini? Why should we have to wear certain things because we’re pregnant? And I think that’s ridiculous. I’m proud of my body. I love that my body is changing and growing,” Tori says. “I have one or two of the maternity one pieces, of course, but if you can fit into it and you feel good about the bikini, put it on!”
Tori Was ‘Surprised’ Kate Middleton Chose Such Traditional Dress
Tori Spelling – Beauty Expert:
One of the “On-Air” staffers was worried that she might get stretch marks if she has a second child, so she wanted Tori’s expertise on the subject. “I think it’s genetic and if you’re going to get them you’re going to get them. my mom didn’t have stretch marks, now I’m on my fourth pregnancy, I don’t have any. So, if you didn’t get it the first time you’re probably not going to get stretch marks the second time.”

On Lunchables ‘Never Be Bored Again’ Campaign:
Tori Spelling will be making an appearance at the Boys & Girls Club of Burbank and Greater East Valley, Calif. on Tuesday, August 28, 2012 to help kick off a great campaign that will help fund up $100,000 in sport and recreation programs at Boys & Girls Clubs of America. To kick off the effort, Spelling and her kids, will join the Lunchables team and Club kids to build a Sport Court®, in the club’s backyard and announce a national call to action where consumers can help Spelling reach the donation goal.
Tori & Dean Want “An Entire Hockey Team” of Children
“I’m super excited. My family and I, we’re working with Lunchables for their ‘Never Be Bored Again’ campaign. And it’s not just us…everyone everywhere can participate and our goal is to keep our kids from being bored. So, they can upload photos of their kids activities, their boredom busting activities, onto the website facebook.com/lunchables and a one dollar donation will be made to Boys & Girls Clubs with every photo. They can even win up to a million prizes, there’s a million prizes for kids to win. So, incentive to go on.”

Although Katherine Jackson has been given full custody of Michael Jackson’s kids, her husband won’t have a hand in raising them.
People.com reports that Joe Jackson has signed an agreement stating that, aside from occasional visits, he will keep his distance Paris, Prince Michael and Blanket.
That shouldn’t be too difficult considering that Joe and Katherine currently live in two separate houses; she stays Los Angeles while he occupies a home in Las Vegas.
"I have had a close family relationship with these grandchildren since their birth," Joe said. "I do visit the family residence from time to time and will continue to do so, however I will not be involved in raising the children."
For what it’s worth, he thinks that Katherine was the best choice for who should have permanent guardianship of the kids.
"I understand that all decision-making authority regarding the children will rest with Katherine Jackson," Joe said in the deal he signed on July 13. "Katherine Jackson is a wonderful caretaker and guardian, and has done an excellent job raising our children and other grandchildren."

<|endofexample|>
.
Like I stated above, the big prize for the Miami Marlins in this deal was starting pitcher, Jacob Turner. Turner was taking in the 2009 draft and has been on the fast track to the major leagues ever since. He has a sinking fastball, change-up and a couple other secondary pitches. He was finding a good amount of success in AA/AAA last season, but he’s faced some struggles this year. His FIP in AAA is currently 3.58. He made a couple of starts in the majors this and results weren’t very great The Detroit Tigers rushed him to the majors when he clearly wasn’t ready.
This isn’t something new though, a similar thing happened when the Tigers rushed Rick Porcello to the bigs. He’s faced struggles ever since. The Marlins are putting him AAA and hopefully they keep him there for the rest of the year. Still, Turner has the potential to be a number one or number two pitcher.
Rob Brantly is a catcher who is currently in AAA but has struggled immensely. His slash line is a paltry .254/.295/.285. He’s had mixed results in the minors. but he’s a left-handed batter so he could end up in a platoon role. He could get promoted sooner rather than later since the Marlins have a need at catcher. Brian Flynn could eventually crack the rotation, but it’s also possible that he ends up in the bullpen. The Marlins came into the season with the thought that they’d contend, but that obviously didn’t happen.
Omar Infante provides an immediate upgrade for the Tigers. Before Infante, the Tigers played Ramon Santiago, Danny Worth and Ryan Raburn at second. Needless to say the results were pitiful. Infante brings solid defense and an above average bat, and should be able to provide close to a win in value. The way the White Sox have been playing that win could determine first place or not.
Anibal Sanchez is the other piece going to Detroit. Since 2010 Sanchez has had a FIP in the 3.30-3.40 range and in my opinion has been one of the more under-appreciated pitchers in baseball. This year he’s off to another solid season, posting a 3.41 FIP and 3.56 SIERA. Going from Miami to Detroit shouldn’t make a huge difference park factor wise, but going from the National League to the American League could have an impact. He does give the Tigers a good number two pitcher and should be a big help in the playoffs, if the Tigers are lucky enough to make them.
Overall I think it’s a good deal for both teams. The Marlins get a young pitcher that can help them for years to come while the Tigers get two key pieces that should help them as we advance towards the post-season.

Aural Pleasure Review
Buho: 'Beggar's Teeth' EP
Published: July 25, 2012
Beggar's Teeth, Búho's second EP since their 2011 reunion, is surprisingly straight-forward and brief (this is the latest of several upcoming EP releases by the band). Producer Roland De La Cruz (guitarist in Cryin' D.T. Buffkin and the Bad Breath) coats the band in a murky menace. "Remainders," a standard for Búho (Spanish for "owl") returns in short form, marrying a metallic melancholy with a fitting tentativeness, and "Da-Doooom" combines post-punk "slow-fast" sections with classic grunge tone in the song's climax. Beggar's Teeth will be released at 9 p.m. Thursday, July 26, at Boneshakers ($5-$10, 306 Austin), as part of a bill that includes Buildings (from Minneapolis, Minn.), Slo-Poke, and God Town.

Cynthia Cynthia Kavanagh ARI #31137126 DOB October 2, 2007 White
Cynthia is a half Peruvian half Chilean beauty. From the time she was born, through the following weeks of her maturing, she delighted us all with her grace, charm and great personal style… so much so that we couldn’t resist naming her after our favorite Mitford heroine, Cynthia Kavanagh. If you’re familiar with the Jan Karon series, you’ll quickly understand what this little alpaca is all about… engaging, delightful, determined, and quite the lady.
Cynthia enjoys some enviable heritage. Her father is the up and coming Apollo, grandson of Peruvian Hemingway and Peruvian Don Julio. These genetics are reflected in her wonderful fleece… soft, fine and dense with good crimp and long staple length.
Cynthia's first boy, Noah, was recently delivered to his new home in Prossser. Cynthia is bred to our remarkable El Nino son, Pronto. She is due August 2011.
Update: Cynthia delivered an adorable female cria August 16th... we've named her Kathryn Kavanagh... Kate!

Her 2009 boy by our Royal Fawn son has excellent herdsire potential. His blindingly white fleece has luscious crimp, incredible staple length and is oh so fine. We named him “Carerra – A Rock Solid Investment.”
Riti is bred to our Hemingway son, the remarkable Ned Kelly. She is due late September.

SueDAHL’s Sumaq PukaARI #30453043DOB August 9, 2004Dark BrownPrice: SOLD
Sue is the first girl to greet you entering the pasture, passing on her inquisitive demeanor to her offspring. She has produced a stunning light fawn female out of a medium fawn male, and a handsome black and white tuxedo male who is the spitting image of his father. Sue’s 2009 daughter by the award winning Paladin is stunning, and will definitely hit the show ring this season. We believe Sue will continue to pass through the dominant characteristics of the sire she’s bred to, allowing less guessing and more genetic planning.
Sue’s fiber is fairly unimproved… But Oh Her Color! She’s carries that rich mahogany red-brown that wows the spinners every shearing season. And we’ve already seen that putting her with an outstanding male will easily produce measurable improvement in all characteristics.
Conformation? Erect, tall and true, with ideal proportions and elegant carriage. She’s never been overweight and maintains a healthy appetite. Correct bite.
Sue is a wonderful mother who conceives readily, carries to term, births unassisted, with lots of milk and high IGgs. She has a long and fruitful breeding career ahead of her.

With a pleasing head and straight, proud carriage, Marcie is a stand-out in the pasture. She possesses an incredible combination of density, crimp and coverage.
Her sire, Marcelino, is the grandson of the famous Accoyo Pluro and the son of Ross, a well-known AOA rose grey herdsire.
Her maiden breeding to Brilliance of Peru (with Guellermo/Ion heritage) produced a remarkable beige son whom we named Brilliant Bo Jangles. Taking a fourth place in a large class at Showcase, he sure knows he’s herdsire potential. Her 2009 daughter we named Lacey, because her fiber is just that! Her 2010 daughter, Willow, by our remarkable Hemingway son, Ned Kelly, is 16 micron! Marcie breeds easily, births unassisted, has lots of milk, instinctive mothering skills, high IgGs.
Marcie delivered a stunning dark fawn female cria by Snowmass Bronze Sculptor this fall. This remarkable young herdsire now resides in Switzerland, with very limited breedings by him prior to his departure. We're putting Marcie this fall to our newest outstanding herdsire, FDA Top Dollar, a dark fawn. Next year's cria should be another show-stopper!
SophiaEARA SophiaARI #1262735DOB September 17, 2005Medium Silver Grey/WhitePrice: SOLD
Sophia was named for Sophia Loren, and rightly so… what a beauty! She’s our front-pasture-girl, the one everyone comments on. With her stunning face, beautiful silver grey fiber and regal carriage, she’s a stand-out.
Sophia’s luxurious silver grey fiber is spoken for each season. Fiber artists and spinners love her soft hand, long staple length and subtle crimp. Her fiber has ribboned in spin-off competitions.Her maiden breeding to Snowmass Condor produced a beautiful rose grey female whom we named Sophia’s Summer Storm. Sophia conceives readily, births easily, has lots of milk and wonderful mothering skills. Her daughter had a high IGg and is thriving.
Update: Sophia’s 2009 cria is a stunning medium brown female, and her 2010 cria is a darling white female. Sophia’s mother produced mostly female offspring. It appears Sophia is following in her footsteps.

Kelsie has produced a medium fawn and white out of a white male; a true black out of a light fawn male; a dark brown and white out of a medium fawn male; and a dark brown out of a medium fawn male.
Kelsie is a large female with stout bone, great proportions, straight legs and backline. She had a short yet successful show career with two blue Ribbons and one Red Ribbon at major shows. In the yearling class at AOBA Nationals, Judge Jude Anderson’s comments included “straight top line and long straight legs… a well-grown out girl who is virtually tied with the much older first place animal.”
Kelsie’s black and white fiber is a favorite with spinners and sells readily each season.
Kelsie was held open to breed this spring. She comes with two breedings to our Royal Fawn son, El Nino son or our Hemingway son.

Orthodox Christian Fellowship (OCF) University of Wisconsin – Madison
The Orthodox Christian Fellowship is active and energetic on the campus of the University of Wisconsin – Madison. The group meets weekly at the Lutheran Campus Center (the corner of University Ave. & Mills St.,) Tuesday evening, 6:30pm-8:30pm. All are welcome.
The UW-Madison OCF has been developing it’s program over approximately the last ten years under the leadership of its spiritual adviser and priest of St. Ignatius Church, the V. Rev. Fr. Patrick Kinder. Of recent history, Rich & Hollie Benton (both graduates of St. Vladimir’s Seminary) spent several years as lay advisers to the OCF, working creatively to develop the OCF’s weekly program of activities which include one monthly Vespers Service on campus, lively discussions, guest speakers, social activities and service projects. The Bentons were also instrumental in helping connect Madis0n’s two Orthodox communities, St. Ignatius and Assumption GOC (Fr. Michael Vanderhoef, pastor), with the OCF ministry and the students of the OCF with Madison’s local Orthodox communities.
Currently students try to attend church together one Sunday a month at each church. In addition, the students are also very conscientious about attending special services throughout both the fall and spring semesters. Both parishes feel blessed to have these students in their churches and have done many special things to express their love, including providing rides to church, offering care packages during finals week, and maybe most generously, providing weekly meals for the students when they meet at the LCC. The churches and students definitely hold each other in deep appreciation.
Since the Benton’s graduation and departure in the fall of 2010, Fr. Gregory Jensen has stepped in to provide a regular advisory role, and along with new lay adviser, Robert Seidel, the OCF continues on a very healthy path providing the opportunity for our Orthodox Christian student community to have a place to stay connected to their faith during the important and formative years of college.
If you have any questions, please contact Fr. Patrick at the church, (608) 273-0133, or through the e-mail contact on this web site.

Great expectations nothing new for Cardinals
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- About the only thing that never changes with the St. Louis Cardinals are the expectations.
"I like how our fans demand winning," third baseman David Freese said. "That's cool to be part of. They expect it out of you. They're used to it. There's nothing better than winning."
That's why this Spring Training is no different from any other for the Cardinals. Just win, baby.
"I've been in other organizations, and they talk about competing," manager Mike Matheny said. "That's a different message. We honestly say our expectation is to win. That's it. That's why we're here. That's what this organization is about. Does that put a target on you? Probably."
The Cardinals are a reminder that great organizations endure even as players -- and managers -- come and go. That was true last season in the wake of manager Tony La Russa's retirement and first baseman Albert Pujols departing via free agency.
Ace Chris Carpenter and first baseman Lance Berkman were injured for most of the season, but the Cardinals rolled on anyway, making the playoffs for the ninth time in 13 years and getting to Game 7 of the National League Championship Series.
"The way the St. Louis Cardinals have always worked is they do what's in the best interests of putting together a winning team," Freese said. "They did it last year in bringing in Carlos [Beltran] and keeping the train running. You win the World Series, and then get to Game 7 of the NLCS. That's a special two-year run."
And this is where the 2013 season begins. The Cardinals came to Spring Training with very few questions and have enjoyed a relatively headline-free camp.
Shortstop Rafael Furcal will be gone for the season while recovering from Tommy John surgery, but 24-year-old Pete Kozma has had an outstanding camp.
Even when Carpenter put his career on hold with neck and shoulder issues, the Cardinals had enough pitching depth that one of their top prospects -- Shelby Miller or Joe Kelly -- may not make the team.
The Nationals are a more popular choice to win the NL pennant, and the Giants, Reds, Dodgers and others are solid.
But there can't be a conversation about the pennant race without including the Cardinals, a team good enough to play deep into October again as they've transitioned from the Pujols era to a group that now includes Allen Craig and Jon Jay and Lance Lynn and Matt Carpenter, among others.
"I'm more excited about this team than I have been the last couple of years," Freese said. "I like hitting, but it's our young arms. You want to have a six-inning ballgame and be confident in the guys you're bringing in for the seventh, eighth and ninth. However our bullpen shakes out, I think we're going to have that."
There's competition from within, too, with center fielder Oscar Taveras, one of baseball's best prospects, possibly figuring into the mix sometime this summer.
Same as it ever was.
"When you reflect back on 2012, there were many that were anxious about our team," general manager John Mozeliak said in an email. "But our goals remained the same, and that is to win."
Freese grew up in St. Louis and dreamed of wearing the uniform. When he walks into the Spring Training clubhouse and sees Bob Gibson and Bruce Sutter and Ozzie Smith and Lou Brock and other greats in uniform, he understands what this franchise is all about.
One franchise sets the bar for another.
"That's a culture, and that's something this organization has promoted," Matheny said. "They want to be here. When they're here, they're not just over signing autographs. They're going group to group making themselves available. The next thing you see some of our young relievers sitting down next to Bruce or see some of our young starters asking Gibby questions."
Also, the late Stan Musial had been a spring regular until recent years.
"When you have that level of expectation for how things are done and this is how you carry yourself and this is what it looks like to be a Cardinal, it eventually trickles down to the way these guys go about their business," Matheny said.

“One of my biggest challenges in life has always been my weight. I have tried many different diets without success. I could lose some weight, but then gain it back again plus more. I looked in the mirror one day and found myself almost 100 pounds overweight and asked myself how I got this way. I knew that I had to lose the weight but was unsure how to make it happen. I started hearing about a weight loss program called “Medifast” and decided that it wouldn’t hurt to talk to them. So my wife and I went in for a consultation.”
“There were many aspects of the Medifast program that contributed to my successful weight loss. The structure of the program helped me reach my weight loss goal by keeping me focused week to week. I was able to create a realistic goal by using the In-body scan analysis and stayed motivated by using incentives and weekly visits with my personal Medifast counselor, Lily. Lily has been a big reason for my weight loss success because of her positive attitude and fun experiences each week. Thank you, Medifast and Lily for changing my life for the better.”

“As my weight crept up over the years, so had my blood pressure. I had been trying so long to lose this weight; I was depressed and disappointed in myself. When I was told I could achieve my goal. I wasn’t very hopeful. But my first week on the Medifast Weight Control Center program I was amazed and inspired by the results!”
“Now I wake up everyday feeling so much better about myself. I look forward to getting on the scale and have to stop and admire how great clothes look on me. My doctor was even a bit perplexed at how much my blood pressure had improved. He attributed it to my weight loss and took me off my blood pressure medication.”
“My goal now is to maintain this weight and continue to increase my fitness. I want to get more defined muscles: a six pack, good triceps, and biceps. This summer I want to be amazing in my bikini. I’m already wearing clothes I couldn’t wear before – leggings and skinny jeans, fitted shirts and dresses. I don’t have to be embarrassed about how my bottom looks when I walk away or have to worry about my stomach sticking out when I’m seen from the side. Not bad for a 61 year old!”

I have decreased my body fat percentage into the normal range, as well as my Body Mass Index. I’ve developed more lean muscles mass and have become a healthier person overall. Throughout my weight loss journey, I learned little techniques that would help me stay on track and keep of this weight off.

“I repeatedly heard the radio commercials, but was skeptical until I saw one of my co-workers lose a lot of weight on the Medifast program. I feel tremendously better after losing the weight. My blood pressure is lower and my backaches and knee aches are gone completely. Now I am able to run 6 miles (2-3 times a week), practice yoga, lift weights and wear my skinny jeans!”
“The food and stellar follow through from my Counselor we’re the best parts of the Medifast program.”

In fear for my health and the desire to watch my daughter grow up, I began Medifast at the suggestion of a friend. As of today, I am down 58 pounds. I feel fantastic and have kept the weight off for three months. I have qualified for the Boston and New York Marathon and recently completed my sixth marathon with a Boston Qualification time of 2:59:21! My Counselor, Caitlyn, was very motivating the whole time and helped me so much throughout the program!”

“I decided early on in my Medifast program that I wasn’t going to focus on “losing weight: but on ‘finding my skinny’. I had a mental picture of what I wanted to look (as well as some photos from many years ago) and decided that was going to be goal. I had put on 55 lbs over the past 11 years and was skeptical that I was going to be able lose it all. Was I surprised!
I began seeing the difference within two weeks. I first noticed that my neck size was getting smaller and my collard shirts were fitting better. I also stopped snoring throughout the night and within a short time, I was getting full nights sleep without waking up. After that, my shirt size went from XXL to L. My waistline decreased and about 1.5 months later, I was forced to start buying new clothes. Now, my waist is 6 inches smaller than when I stated and I’ve donated all of my old pants to charity. My energy levels have increased and I don’t have those aches and pains associated with caring the extra around anymore.
‘Finding my skinny’ through Medifast was a lot easier than I thought it would be. Within 4 months I lost 55 lbs and now that I’ve moved into the next phase, I’m using the good eating habits I’ve learned to make better choices.”

(CBS)
SANTA ROSA (CBS SF) — A dog died after alerting its owner to a residential fire in southwest Santa Rosa early Monday morning, a Santa Rosa Fire Department battalion chief said.
Justin Kedton, 24, was awakened around 4 a.m. by his barking pit bull, Battalion Chief Jack Piccinini said.
Kedton and his dog escaped the burning home at 1709 Hearn Ave., but the dog went back into the house while Kedton tried to put out the fire with a garden hose, Piccinini said. The dog was overcome by smoke and was found in a bedroom in back of the house.
Neighbors and passersby reported the fire that spread from the back deck and rear garage to the house and attic, Piccinini said.
Firefighters found the house fully involved in fire when they arrived but brought it under control in about 20 minutes, Piccinini said.
There were no injuries and damage is estimated at $100,000. Smoking materials discarded on the back deck are suspected as the cause of the fire, Piccinini said.
A second fire erupted 20 minutes later at 2517 Dixie Place in the nearby Roseland neighborhood in southwest Santa Rosa, Piccinini said.
The fire started in the engine compartment of a Toyota truck owned by 27-year-old Ignacio Gallego, the occupant of the residence.
The truck fire spread to the side yard fence and fiberglass- covered lean-to and into attic space over the garage.
Firefighters from the Coffey Lane fire station in northwest Santa Rosa responded in place of the fire department fighting the Hearn Avenue blaze, Piccinini said.
They arrived in 10 minutes and prevented the blaze from spreading into the house, Piccinini said.
There were no injuries and damage is estimated at $25,000. The cause of the truck engine fire is under investigation.

DEN.
Rox place Nicasio on DL; Moscoso recalled."
Worth noting
Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (strained left groin) said he felt "pretty good" and was confident his stint on the 15-day disabled list -- on which he was placed May 31 -- will be enough to properly rehab his injury. After missing Saturday's game with a sore right quadriceps, third baseman Jordan Pacheco was back in the starting lineup Sunday against the Dodgers, hitting sixth.
The Rockies officially released left-hander Jamie Moyer, making him free to sign with any team. The 49-year-old, who went 2-5 with a 5.70 ERA for Colorado, is the oldest pitcher to win a game. Moyer was designated for assignment Wednesday.
Drew Pomeranz started Sunday for Triple-A Colorado Springs. Pomeranz, who allowed one run with seven strikeouts over 4 2/3 innings, was optioned on May 11 after going 0-2 in five starts with the Rockies. Manager Jim Tracy wants to see improvement in Pomeranz's mechanics, so as to avoid injury. Tracy also wants to see the left-hander display a consistent ability to pitch to both sides of the plate.

STABLE NOTES BY ED GOLDEN
• SECRET CIRCLE MAKES 3-YEAR-OLD DEBUT IN SHAM STAKES
• NAKATANI SET WITH BC WINNER REGALLY READY IN DAYTONA
• HALL OF FAMER PINCAY REMEMBERS SHAM, TO PRESENT TROPHY
• STEADY TWEEBSTER EYES FIRST STAKES WIN IN SAN PASQUAL
BAFFERT BEGINS TRIPLE CROWN PURSUIT IN SHAM WITH SECRET CIRCLE
Secret Circle takes what Bob Baffert hopes will be the first successful step on the Triple Crown trail when the undefeated Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Sprint winner takes on five rivals in Saturday’s Grade III, $100,000 Sham Stakes for 3-year-olds at one mile.
Previously run at a mile and an eighth from its inception in 2001 through 2010, and shortened to a mile and a sixteenth last year when won by Tapizar, the Sham at one mile seems more logical to Baffert at this point, with the Santa Anita Derby at 1 1/8 miles three months away and the Kentucky Derby at a mile and quarter four months down the road on May 5.
“Running the Sham at a mile and an eighth this time of year was too early,” said Baffert, a six- time winner of the Santa Anita Derby and a three-time winner of the Run for the Roses. “The San Vicente (at seven furlongs on Feb. 19) used to be the first week in February and that race would sort of set it off,” Baffert said, referring to the pursuit in earnest of the 3-year-old classics.
“But the Sham at one mile now is a good spot for horses whose potential for longer distances you’re not certain of,” said the Hall of Fame trainer, who celebrates his 59th birthday on Jan. 13. “We’re going to find out more about Secret Circle in this race.”
A son of Eddington, Secret Circle has never raced beyond six furlongs. Owned by Mike Pegram, Karl Watson and Paul Weitman of Lookin at Lucky fame, Secret Circle worked four furlongs on Santa Anita’s fast main track Tuesday in 49.60.
The field for the Sham, the third of nine races: Senor Rain, Joe Talamo; Out of Bounds, Garrett Gomez; Hierro, Julien Leparoux; Secret Circle, Rafael Bejarano; Longview Drive, Joel Rosario; and Handsome Mike, Corey Nakatani.
Each is assigned 118 pounds.
LEGENDARY PINCAY TO PRESENT SHAM STAKES TROPHY SATURDAY
Legendary retired Hall of Fame Jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. will present the trophy for Saturday’s Grade III Sham Stakes and Pincay has fond memories of the race’s namesake—39 years after running second to the great Secretariat in the 1973 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.
“I tell you, Sham is definitely one of the best horses I ever rode,” said Pincay, who turned 65 on Dec. 29. “He could have been the second-best horse I ever rode. He didn’t run in that many races (13), but he was such a powerful horse. He could do anything, he had speed and was a very, very nice horse.
“Going into the Derby I felt very good about my chances. We had won the Santa Anita Derby and we beat Secretariat in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. We ran second in the Wood and he ran third (beaten four lengths by Sham) and I figured we had a good chance to beat him in Kentucky. I had a very good feeling about our chances.
“The night before the race Pancho Martin (trainer of Sham) told me ‘this horse is going to do something special tomorrow.’ And he did. He broke the track record, but it wasn’t good enough. Sham ran another great race in the Preakness (finishing second). He was just very unlucky to come along the same year as Secretariat.”
Sham, a bay colt by Pretense, was retired following the ’73 Belmont Stakes, a race in which he finished last after trying to run early with Secretariat. Sham finished up with a 5-5-1 record and $204,808 in earnings.
Pincay, who won his first and only Kentucky Derby in 1984 aboard the Woody Stephens-trained Swale, won a total of six Santa Anita Derbies, including the ’78 renewal aboard the Laz Barrera-conditioned Affirmed, who Pincay considers to be the best horse he ever rode.
The Sham Stakes will be run for the 12th time on Saturday and will be contested for the first time at the distance of one mile.
REGALLY READY HEADS CRACK DAYTONA STAKES LINEUP ON SUNDAY
A jockey with unquestioned riding ability, a world-class agent, and a two-time Eclipse Award-winning trainer who wins more races in one year than some trainers win in a lifetime is a winning combination.
It’s also a union that’s favored to reach the winner’s circle with Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint winner Regally Ready in Sunday’s Daytona Stakes, a Grade III, $100,000 race on Santa Anita’s turf course at about 6 ½ furlongs. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, whose agent is Ron Anderson, and trained by Steve Asmussen, Regally Ready will be making his first start since capturing the Turf Sprint under 126 pounds as the 2-1 favorite at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5.
Nakatani, a native of Covina, a regular on the California circuit from the time he began his career more than 20 years ago, uprooted recently in search of greener pastures back East. Since joining with Anderson a little over three months ago and through his own initiative in gaining access to Asmussen’s prolific barn, the 41-year-old Nakatani has once again reached racing’s apex.
With Anderson booking the mounts, Nakatani won six races in one day at Belmont Park on Oct. 8, two of them Grade I’s.
Nakatani has eight Breeders’ Cup wins, including last year’s Turf Sprint on Regally Ready, a gelded son of More Than Ready Nakatani has ridden eight times, winning five. Owned by the Vinery Stables of Dr. Tom Simon of Mallorca, Spain and Lexington, Ky., Regally Ready has nine wins from 17 starts, with earnings of $1,210, 684.
.”
As for his resurrected career, Anderson, who has represented legends such as Jerry Bailey and Gary Stevens among others, gives Nakatani full kudos for hooking up with Asmussen.
“He got himself in starting at Oaklawn Park last year,” Anderson said. “Corey did exceptionally well with Asmussen there and things continued to blossom after that.” Understandably, Nakatani is delighted with his current status.
“No doubt about it,” Nakatani said. “It’s a matter of finally getting healthy and getting your weight right. It helps to be able to exercise, train and get on horses all the time. You have to get supporters like Steve. All of his owners have been very successful together. I hope we can keep the ball rolling.”
The field for the Daytona, race eight on a nine-race card: Calimonco, Mike Smith; Mr Gruff, Joel Rosario; Victory Pete, Martin Garcia; Caracortado, Rafael Bejarano; Silver Summation, Garrett Gomez; Regally Ready, Nakatani; and Al Instante, Kevin Krigger.
TWEEBSTER EYES FIRST STAKES WIN IN SAN PASQUAL
Tweebster is nothing if not consistent, but Bob Baffert is hoping the 5-year-old son of Tapit breaks the mold and wins his first stakes race when he runs in Saturday’s Grade II, $150,000 San Pasqual Stakes, an important steppingstone to the Grade I, $750,000 Santa Anita Handicap March 3.
“He’s an honest little horse,’ the Hall of Fame trainer said, “but he can’t get by seconditis.”
Owned by Shah Kaleem, Tweebster has a 3-6-4 record from 15 starts, with earnings of $216,290. The gray gelding was third in the Grade III Native Diver Handicap last out on Dec. 3. He has failed to earn a check only once, when he finished seventh in last year’s Santa Anita Handicap behind stablemate Game on Dude, who is a finalist for an Eclipse Award as outstanding older male in 2011.
The field for the San Pasqual, which goes as race eight: Skipshot, Joe Talamo; Thirtyfirststreet, Hector Berrios; Java Man, Garrett Gomez; Tweebster, Rafael Bejarano; Utopian, Chantal Sutherland; Tres Borrachos, Joel Rosario; Uh Oh Bango, Mike Smith; and Massone, Martin Garcia.
‘THE BAD CAT’ LIVES UP TO HIS NAME IN DOLLASE BARN
Call El Gato Malo a good Thoroughbred or the bad cat, and either description fits the 7-year-old gelding that runs in today’s seventh and featured race. He is one tough animal.
Winner of seven of 21 career races and $638,466 for West Point Thoroughbreds and trainer Craig Dollase, the Kentucky-bred gelding would never be compared to a day at the beach when he’s at the barn.
“El Gato Malo (the bad cat in Spanish) is aptly named,” said the 41-year-old Dollase, who recently moved his base of operations from Hollywood Park to Santa Anita, where he has 20 head. “He just turned seven on Jan. 1 and he definitely has some quirks. He lives behind a cage in the front of his stall and you have to handle him with kid gloves. He’s already a gelding, so we put up with his antics.”
The son of El Corredor is no slouch on the race track, but doesn’t quite have the resume of another Dollase senior citizen, Awesome Gem, winner of the Grade I Hollywood Gold Cup last year and earner of $2,738,270. The chestnut gelding has a 9-15-5 record from 47 starts.
“My Old Man, Awesome Gem, recently came in from off the shelf,” Dollase said. “He’ll make his 2012 debut as a 9-year-old but not until the end of the meet, probably in April.
“Awesome Gem’s been a real trouper. He had a minor hind end setback and we sent him to Winners Circle Ranch. It’s nice to have the old boy back in the barn. In fact, he’s our barn mascot.”
FINISH LINES: M One Rifle, winner of the 2009 Malibu Stakes, fired another bullet Thursday morning, working five furlongs on Santa Anita’s fast main track in 59 seconds, fastest of 36 drills at the distance, the average time of which was 1:00.85. Bruce Headley is preparing M One Rifle for the Grade II Palos Verdes Stakes on Jan. 21 and a meeting with Breeders’ Cup Sprint winner Amazombie . . . California Cup Classic winner Norvsky worked five furlongs for Don Warren in 1:02.60, while Tapizar went six furlongs in 1:12.60 for Steve Asmussen . . . At Hollywood Park Thursday, Sir Beaufort winner Mr. Commons worked four furlongs on Cushion Track in 48.40 for John Shirreffs . . . Congratulations to jockey Chantal Sutherland, who recently tweeted this announcement on her engagement:  . . . Entering Thursday’s races, 2,208 players remained alive in ShowVivor . . .

The 5-year-old Medaglia d’Oro mare won the Grade I Test Stakes in 2010 and finished her career with $614,940 in earnings . . . San Gabriel Valley Tribune turf writer Art Wilson, recovering from cancer treatment, writes to say: “Got some great news from my doctor this week that my kidneys have shown ‘remarkable improvement’ and that made me feel really good.

I am not looking at their sarees, I am looking at their faces and seeing the anticipation of new life, a little bit of smile, a little bit of sorrow, a little bit of trepidation and a little bit of anxiety.. It is so beautiful and delightful. I just LOVE it.
Here she is, wearing her brand new saree that hasn’t even been taken out of the box and properly unpleated, wearing all that gold that shimmers.
so true just beautiful, may there marriage

New Zealand cricket chiefs issued a public apology to axed captain Ross Taylor on Wednesday,. (These kiwis are forever squabbling about something or other! Hahahahhaha),. (Oh if only the nz rugby people had this type of honesty and just returned the burgled world cup to the IRB etc!! Alas no chance of that!).
Perhaps if Proteas prove to be too strong they should try some youngsters?
This team won't go lie down Beeno, but they sure as hell are alot weaker withou Vetori and Taylor.
Taking that into account, I would try and maintain some consistency by not picking too many new faces, This excludes the T20, as i see sideshow cricket as just that, Cricket for people that don't like cricket. So they can experiment with the T20 side as much as they like it should be a good platfomr for a youngster to come in on.
Maybe give Subrayen and de Kock a chanch there. Although I suspect with Pangiso's curren't fomr and the form he showed in the Champions leaugue in the T20 format he would make the squad ahead of Subrayen.
Ek I practically never watch T20 - its baseball really.
The black caps did well against Sri Lanka so can be too bad. How well they play pace is a question. I take it this is a three series match up. If we win first two bring in the younger players? Who is really knocking on the door?
I see Tahir and Tami were both not included in Lions for the finals. We are without Smith. They mentioned a spinner for the Lions who has been doing well. Is he a guy we could use as Tahir look to be out of the picture now. Pity as one had high hopes that we had found a wrist spinner at long long last.
The Spinner for the Lions is the guy i mentioned on the other thread and above.
Aaron Pangiso. Alas not a wristy as I believe that is the most difficult bowling action to master, and a beuty to behold when done correctly. but he has been doing well and I won't mind if they give him the chance.
He is not the youngest guy around but deserves a shot at least

SBW sets sights on Olympics earlier this month in Australia.
"I think I am best at putting on the boots and running out on the field to play rugby union or rugby league," said Williams.
"If I had lost that fight I would have given it away because it is just not worth it, but I overcame some hurdles and the reaction of all the people close to me was good so we will assess it when the time is right."
Williams, on the receiving end of some heavy blows from Botha in the final round of the bout, admitted that boxing was a challenge.
"I am not perfect but I am just trying to keep improving and if everyone is saying I have improved then I will just keep plugging away and maybe have another fight," he said.
"But at this stage I am concentrating on playing rugby league and we will assess that after the season. At this stage, I have had enough of boxing for now.".

also drive me the craziest. From the second she was born, Sofia has been a little force to be reckoned with. She has always been vocal (aka LOUD, or as my husband says, just like mama), stubborn (he also says she gets this from me, um, no comment) and fearless (did I mention GREY HAIRS?). All wonderful traits IF taught how to use them for good and not to melt down in the middle of a store because she can’t have ice cream instead of vegetables…cough.
As you can see, she is 5 going on 15. Every day she teaches me something new and every day she outsmarts me. But with five years under my belt… this mama has a trick or two up her sleeve. While I may not have parenthood completely down, I do have a few tips and tricks that I have learned while “on the job.”
- Listen to your kiddos. Yes they break down and have whine-a-thons but sometimes the whining and meltdown is cause they were trying to tell you something and it just didn’t get through. Take a moment and listen…are they tired? hungry? just want attention? Even infants have cues to let mama know something, all it takes is a little patience and an open ear. If that doesn’t work…hey, there is always bribery.
- Be prepared for the unexpected. Ever heard the phrase “If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans”? With kids, that phrase goes for double. While you shouldn’t be overly paranoid, taking certain precautions will always pay off. With infants and toddlers, having a “emergency” clothing and diaper kit in your car is a smart idea. As well as packing snacks just in case and planning ”unexpected” potty stops on a long drive. Maya Angelou said it best, “Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between.”
- Take a moment for you. You can’t be a good parent unless you take care of you first. Whether that’s an evening out with your friends, a cup of coffee alone before everyone wakes, or just a moment of sitting in your car in silence…whatever it is that you need to recharge and be the super parent you are. I like to drink wine. A glass or four usually does the trick.
Now you can survive the parenting battleground with others that know just what you are feeling. Mexican TV personality and father of two, Poncho de Anda, teamed with Huggies 10 months) as they deal with the challenges that come with being a parent – whether that’s packing for a trip, preparing for house guests or mastering the art of feeding children. Check out one of the videos below, then head over to the facebook page where you can to share your own tips and stories afor a chance to win a fully-stocked Huggies diaper bag.
Disclosure: This was a compensated campaign from Latina Bloggers Connect and Huggies. All opinions are 100% my own.
Good tips! The “prepare for the unexpected” bit made me laugh. WORD.
Good tips! Having kids has really mellowed me out a lot, learning to be patient is a daily struggle, but my two boys have helped me come a long way. I now find myself constantly telling other people ‘don’t worry about what you can’t do anything about , let it roll off your back like a duck’

EGYPT, BARADEI (THE ISRAEL IDIOTS’ HOPE,) AND OUR PERSISTENT STATE-OF-ENTRAPMENT
In memory: Charles B. BiscoeIn memory: Charles B. Biscoe
d r a f t
The Egyptian state has for decades been waging war on the Muslim Brotherhood. It has done that pre-Uncle-Tom-hood (the rejection-of-Arabism at Camp David) and into the Uncle Tom-hood era - - the era since Camp David. Not a month passes without wholesale arrests of members and activists of that Brotherhood. When it comes to the arrests of these activists, the Israel-Anchored Idiots customarily are mum
But when the Egyptian state dare arrest activists demonstrating on behalf of Muhamed AlBaradei, as that state did a few days ago, the Israel Idiots’ State Department becomes “deeply concerned.”
Let me ponder the matter: So ElBaradei is the Israel-Idiots’ man.
Do the Israel Idiots hope to obtain favorable change in Egypt by crowning Baradei President? Will this in any way help them in West Asia, in the Arab nation, and in the Muslim World? Or help absorb the ire of the Egyptian Arab Muslim Street about the wars the Israel Idiots are waging in Muslim lands?
d r a f t
Or, is it that the Israel Idiots are so incapable at budging their Israel Anchor, or at suffocating the Islamic Republic, that they spin their wheels in Egypt just for the sake of seeming to have a plan, any plan - - any some sort of plan.
Pitiful Israel-Anchored Idiots!
There are moments when the honorable-and-smart thing to do is to shut up. This is one such moment in Egypt. Why? Because neither their man Baradei nor any of his ilk should make a difference one-way-or-the-other to the Israel Idiots’ West Asian and Arab interests - -whatever these are.
WHILE OTHERS DEFINE THE IDIOTS’ INTERESTS
Whatever these are: Because, barring holding on to what we’ve got (the oil of the Arabian protectorates and influencing the trajectory of the trillion-dollar accumulated surpluses in these protectorates’ sovereign funds), we don’t know what these interests really are. We’re in a state of daze-and-confusion, the elite acting with fake confidence to fool the public and itself. We’re spinning our wheels the old-and-familiar way, not knowing what else to do. This state of affairs becomes increasingly and painfully apparent as we mark each year into the one-trillion-dollar-Israel-Boys’-inspired-illusions, with some of us hoping that these illusions would have been burst by the Iraq fiasco. But, have they?
Dangerously (as it could lead us into yet another unnecessary war), in this state of daze, the Saudi ruling elite is defining our interests for us in Plantation Iraq while Israel’s Boys are defining them on the Highway to Central Asia - - by pressuring, with their right-wing (and eminently discredited!) allies, for U.S troops to stay the course, straddling the sides of that Highway-to-Full-Bankruptcy-and-absolute-hatred-of-us-in-the-Muslim-World.
AND WHAT A STATE OF ENTRAPMENT!
Post-Iraq and the disastrous strategic fiasco of adopting the ideas of Israel’s Boys, there’s a dire need for new concepts, for a long-term perspective - - and for courage. New concepts and new thinking, perspective, and courage are all so missing. There’s a dire need to engage in a thorough re-evaluation of our state-of-entrapment in that systemic power vacuum trap that is our Israel-Anchored Highway to Central Asia project. And there’s every reason to believe that no such re-evaluation is in the offing. It seems to me that, child-like, we’re expecting Daddy-the-Pentagon to effect the needed re-evaluation, as if the solutions are military, which they’re not. The solutions unavoidably will require the withdrawal of troops for political (tame the ire of the Muslim World against Israel-Anchored Us) and budget reasons (save the federal government and the layers of other governments from continued bankruptcy and concomitant social upheavals) and not for obvious military ones (not too many casualties, therefore let us stay.) It also seems to me that no one dares engage in the needed re-evaluation, honest and creative, as all run scared of the right wing boogeyman and of Israel’s influence in the U.S. Congress.
d r a f t
I’ve been accused of hyper-efficiency; so maybe I’m expecting the re-evaluation to happen yesterday, so obtuse am I to the fact that the American elite, having come so close to losing-it-all in the financial meltdown, and aghast at the resistance to it (and disgust with it) in the Muslim World, is catching its breath while sleep-walking in the daze.
d r a f t
The foreign policy establishment has a way of co-opting all. Of compromising (and neutering) all who speak out and have fresh ideas (read: independent of the Israel Anchor.) So one would expect that the resultant absence of independent and credible voices (voices that are not towing the absurd-and-inane Highway-to-Central-Asia line under whatever guise and voices that are calling for a radical military pullback and military-financial retrenchment) does after all exact a price on the process (so badly needed) of correcting the course - - radically. After the foreign policy establishment does a bang-up job neutering all, with Israel-Anchored efficiency (the national security bureaucracy is Israel-Anchored), it sits there, clueless-in-its-helplessness, unable to fathom the wisdom of shutting up.
Such fools!

Another day, another Christmas horror film to watch and review. I’m actually already tired of the genre, as it seems so obvious that these things are lackluster by all measures. However, this 2006 remake was more than just a throwaway remake, they paid for some talent and they spent some time making the film and editing it to good measure. I know, these remakes have a tendency to put a damper on things, and if you’re one of those people that just hate remakes and won’t even see them, then this film is obviously not for you. However, for the more discerning of you that are just junkies here we go, another film to look at.
As with the previous incarnation of Black Christmas, this film is a rated R slasher fest. However, where the other film left you thinking and imagining things, this film not only sexes it up, it also makes sure you see gore for all it’s bloody glory. That’s where we start our first point, this film has gore with no apologies. From eyes being severed and pulled out, to blood gushing from the neck, to a candy cane well placed in the jugular, they do not hold back on your senses. You hear it, the choking, the coughing, and you see it, the red darkness of life slip out of these actors as if there is no tomorrow! Black Christmas is not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure.
The film starts off relatively slow, and moves through a lot of different points to create an atmosphere much denser than the original film. My problems with the original film were addressed here. The pacing is sped up, but the characters lack that substance that makes you care about them. While I cared about the characters in the original film, this film didn’t really make me care for any of the sorority sisters.
If you get creeped out by old ladies, weird sounds, and gore. This one is not going to be for you. There is a sickening amount of attention given to such details as decapitation, bludgeoning, and at one point the serial killer eats an eyeball! Yep.
Is Black Xmas Scary? Yes.
This is the first film I’ve seen that not only plays with my fear of being invaded at my home, but the unyielding fear that someone is going to not only eat my eyeball, but is also going to cook my skin in cookie cutter form into angels. Yep, I’m scared.
Seriously, this is what horror films should always amount to. A good source for violence, horror, brutality, and of course sex. There’s so much in this film in such a short time, as if the film borrows from a lot of different genres. It even borrows from cannibal movies as the main character eats cookies made out of human skin.
The flashbacks lead to the current story, and the current story blends seamlessly through the transitional stages. That being said, this film looks great. It’s usage of red, yellow, green, and so many other colors really sparks an interest in the motif’s that are set by the director of photography. It’s little details like this that make this film a bit better than many other remakes on the same time line and dare I say genre format.
The camera angles are great in this film. You don’t just get voyeurism for the sake of voyeurism. You get nudity, and disgust, as well as point of view shots similar to the first one. There’s just so much done in this film to try a little more than the previous incarnation of this film. The clarity and focus mixed with the gore effects and the updated story make for a great time. While I don’t think this is the greatest of the holiday horror movies, I appreciate the way this one was constructed. Much like I enjoyed Rob Zombie’s Halloween remakes, I really dug the way this one tried to dive more into the greater story that could be created with the same style of characters. This is far more brutal both in focus and out of focus, and adds spice where it needs spice. Black Xmas is going to be in the upper tiers of your holiday horror collection, bank Michelle Trachtenberg (as she was in 2003 when she was 18, not as she is now obviously).

Calabash Animation, the acclaimed animation studio led by Sean Henry and Wayne Brejcha, takes viewers into the animated fantasy world of ''Eternal Descent,'' the popular comic book/music series created by guitarist Llexi Leon, with a new two-minute short that brings to life the gothic world envisioned in print by Leon and illustrator Jason Metcalf. ''The style of the comic was already established,'' Henry says. ''The first part of our job was to adapt the characters into an animation-friendly style while keeping as much of the look and mood of the original comic as possible. It was a daunting task because the comic art is very detailed and naturalistic; there are few artists who can work in this style fluently. Many animators are comic book fans, and our creative team was excited about the challenge of working in this darker, more realistic style.'' Guitar Wielding Goth Heroes A visually stunning fantasy comic book series published by IDW, ''Eternal Descent'' features storylines filled with gothic adventures featuring guitar-wielding heroes. Acclaimed heavy metal guitarist Leon is the mastermind behind the story, which centers on three main characters -- Lyra, a lead singer/guitarist in a popular band whose fame-at-any-cost attitude has made her vulnerable to Loki, a powerful demon plotting world domination. Helping Lyra is Sirian, one of heaven's guardians. What unifies Lyra and Sirian is their weapon choice: searing electric guitars. In addition to the powerful art of the comic books, which recalls the classic 70s animation magazine Heavy Metal with a modern spin, is the music created by Leon and produced by rock legend Eddie Kramer (Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones). The combined visual and audio components make ''Eternal Descent'' a truly visionary concept that has led to thousands of fans and endorsements from leading music manufacturers like ESP Guitars, Digitech and DiMarzio guitar pickups. ''The concept was action heavy and effects heavy, and although the budget was limited, I was hoping for hand drawn character animation wherever possible,'' Leon says. ''Everyone I spoke too said it couldn't be done. Calabash was the only studio willing to take on the challenge without compromising the script. They were optimistic about the potential of the piece, and they understood what I was trying to achieve. More importantly, they had the creative vision to think well beyond the technical challenges of the action and effects sequences, confident that everything would be possible by mixing mediums and combining techniques.'' Complex Production: Set to an ominous musical score featuring some amazing guitar solos, the story line of the short centers on a concert featuring Lyra that quickly turns from cheering fans in an outdoor stadium to fire-eyed demons trying to capture Lyra. She falls from the stage, crashes through the ground and lands in an underworld coliseum where Loki confronts her. As the battle begins Sirian comes to Lyra's aide. Lyra escapes, but the cliffhanger ending suggests it is only the beginning. Calabash animation director Jessica Plummer led the creative team through the complex production. For her, the challenges centered on managing the production and character details. ''This was a very different project outside our usual fare,'' Plummer says. ''As a director, the challenge was not only understanding the characters and their world, but also trying to convey that insight to the rest of the team. We wanted to reveal the nature of these characters -- from their poses to their expressions. With so little time to get to know these characters before we started work, it felt like we were cramming for a final exam at school.'' Added Henry, ''Everyone knows Calabash for our high-end character work, but we are sometimes pigeon-holed because so much of our work tends to be more on the 'cartoony' side. This was a chance to show the world some of our other capabilities.'' ''Stubble Trouble'' was nominated for an Academy Award in 2002.

Poor Maggie Gyllenhaal was killed off in the Batman franchise before she could take part in this summer’s big noirish blockbuster, but she’s making the most of the summer movie season with … a historical comedy about vibrators? Yes, Hollywood’s most indie lady (sorry, Parker Posey) is making another idiosyncratic role her own with Hysteria, in which she plays a social reformer as the first patients are treated for mysterious female maladies with electric vibrations. Having just given birth, Ms. Gyllenhaal will not be at tonight’s special screening, but co-star Hugh Dancy is taking his night off of Broadway’s Venus in Fur to drop by for the occasion.

policymakers' perspectives: A critical factor in promoting reproductive health development progress in Ukraine
Abstract
The international donor community, predominately the U.S. Government, has invested over $24 million in reproductive health programs in Ukraine, expressly to decrease abortion rates and increase the use of modern contraceptives. Yet, as of 2006, after over 12 years of reproductive health development programming, Ukraine still had one of the highest levels of abortion in the world and the use of modern contraceptives remained very low. In addition, broader international donor goals of building sustainable development programs had not been realized due to Ukrainian policymakers' indifference towards donor supported programs, demonstrated by their lack of financial support for reproductive health development initiatives in Ukraine.^ This investigation reveals one significant reason that Ukrainian policymakers have essentially rejected reproductive health development programs over the past decade: distinct differences between international donors' and Ukrainian policymakers' social constructions and cultural meanings of reproductive health. From 2005-2006 this qualitative study surveyed 42 Ukrainian policymakers and interviewed an additional 42, comparing their feedback to 20 international donor participants working on reproductive health policy and programs in Ukraine. The research methodology was guided by the Policy Circle, the Health Belief Model, and the Theory of Planned Behavior, as well as political-economic and socio-cultural paradigms. Study feedback revealed distinct differences in definitions for reproductive health, cultural meanings of health services, and perceptions of gender. The data also revealed some agreement on perspectives of current reproductive health policy and issues in development. Also, research into donor attitudes challenges prevailing scholarly presuppositions that development is a homogenous movement.^ This research suggests that both donor respondents and Ukrainian policymaker participants define reproductive health in fundamentally different ways. Essentially their reproductive health values and priorities are not closely aligned. Ukrainian policymakers are concerned with major demographic declines and they situate a woman's role as "mother first" of primary importance in Ukrainian society. These priorities appear to be in conflict with donors' goals of increasing modern contraception use in Ukraine. Unlike international donors, Ukrainian policymakers did not conceptualize of abortion within a moral framework; rather, their conceptions of reproductive health were embedded in the political-economic situation at the time.^

What ESA can bring to the International Year of Astronomy
Herschel & Planck – key European contributions to astronomy
The International Year of Astronomy will see the launch of two major astronomical spacecraft, Herschel and Planck. An Arianne-5 launcher will carry both spacecraft into space during 2009.
Herschel, will be the largest ever infrared space observatory and will open up a virtually unexplored part of the spectrum, far infrared to sub-millimetre wavelengths, which cannot be well observed from the ground. Herschel will observe some of the coolest and most distant objects in the Universe to build understanding of stellar and galaxy formation and evolution.?
ESA International Year of Astronomy Projects:
The Planck Dome – Looking back to the dawn of time
The Groningen Discovery Truck – bringing the marvels of the infrared closer to home
Sterne und Weltraum – Herschel and Planck special issue
Celestron SkyScout – Must-have tool for new astronomers
The Celestron SkyScout has been selected as an official product of the International Year of Astronomy 2009. For astronomers exploring the night sky for the first time the SkyScout is a revolutionary device that makes it easy to get started. Point the SkyScout to any star in the night sky and hold your eye to the view finder to instantly identify what you are looking at with the help of an audio guide and/or an on-screen text description.
For this enhanced SkyScout ESA has provided descriptions of deep-sky objects visible to the naked eye that have also been viewed by space-borne observatories. The user will discover how knowledge about these distant objects is pieced together with the help of telescopes in space and will discover that there is really more than meets the eye.

This is a set of shims for the barrel block to receiver (fork).
Over time, some of the B18/B19 series rifles (Phantom, Quest, Optimus, Summit, Vantage, Trail NP, Classic .22, Tac-1, G1, etc.) can develop some slop in the barrel bushings and/or side-to-side movement in the barrel.
This is the solution- 4 shims than can be installed to fit your precise requirements. Two shims are 0.60", two are 0.65" (stock plastic bushings are 0.060").
These bushings are made from aluminum to hold their rigidity, but wear out before the barrel block or tube forks wear (which would be alot more costly than replacing shims after 25000 shots).
Note: Some sanding will be required on the barrel block to fit the shims for a flush installation. Two sizes are included to allow for exact spacing as required by your specific rifle.

Ten thoughts on two fantastic games in Atlanta that ended with Florida State and UNC winning by a combined five points:
1 -- After watching the replay numerous times, I think Kendall Marshall charged on the winning basket against N.C. State in UNC's 69-67 win. That one should have been waved off, as Marshall lowered his shoulder and made contact on the drive.
2 -- I don't think N.C. State's Richard Howell was clearly fouled, however, on the last play of the game. That was the correct no-call. It looked more like a scrum and Howell never had total possession of the ball.
3 -- Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said after his team lost 62-59 that Florida State's Michael Snaer was the best competitor in the ACC.
4 -- If I'm Roy Williams, I don't play John Henson against Florida State unless Henson is absolutely 100 percent without pain in that aching left wrist. Ultimately, I think the Tar Heels have a No.1 NCAA seed either way, and FSU is so physical the chance of re-injury is not out of the question.
5 -- How good is Duke anyway? That's the subject of my Sunday column. The Blue Devils need Ryan Kelly back and need to make some more shots -- they were 10-for-46 from three-point range in Atlanta.
6 -- If Seth Curry's 40-footer at the buzzer had gone in to tie that game and send it into overtime, he would have joined Christian Laettner, Austin Rivers, Jeff Capel and a couple of others on the short list of greatest Duke buzzer-beaters of all time.
7 -- How far off the radar has Duke's Andre Dawkins fallen? He played 17 minutes Saturday and had no points and no assists.
8 -- Florida State's 33-point win over UNC in the teams' only previous meeting will loom large Sunday, although everyone will say it doesn't matter. It does matter in that it has to give the Seminoles major confidence.
9 -- The Wolfpack would have had to call a timeout to get C.J. Leslie out of the game between his fourth and fifth fouls (which came 32 seconds apart -- the final one with 8:03 left). So while I blame the coaching staff for not keeping up with Leslie's fouls well enough and/or not communicating that to head coach Mark Gottfried, that was also Leslie's fault for committing a silly foul on an overly aggressive defensive play right after he had picked up his fourth one.
10 -- UNC and Duke both deserve to play in Greensboro next week for their first two games in the NCAA tournament. UNC as a No.1 seed and Duke as a No.2. I think N.C. State is in the tourney as well now and will get a seed around No.11 or so.

A great semifinal Saturday at the ACC tournament -- 10 thoughts
Labels: ACC tournament
21 comments:
Marshall didn't lower his shoulder--he turned sideways in order to be able to create more space. Apparently you would rather listen to the whines of the Wolfpack conspiracy throrists than watch a replay.
And Curry's shot would have been waived off--fortunately, one of the officials saw the 4 steps he took before launching it.
Do your homework before postying, please.
The ACC and it's Referees are a complete JOKE! "...refs are supposed to exude a sense of impartiality." But we often forget that the ACC is "lead" by John Swofford, who happen to graduate from UNC AND worked for UNC. Many wonder why the ACC's OVERALL quality has tumbled over the years. Why don't someone do something about this?...Here's more on the ACC refs:
Hey Anonymous 8:30 PM, your are blind if you think Marshall was moving sideways. Please let me know before you get on the highway so I can pull over - I don't want to be on the highway the same time as you are.
Also, what is "posting?"
go to statefansnation.com and just read
Marshall admitted he was certain he could get away with a foul after the game. Look up his quote! Refs have let UNC and Duke get away with anything AND the players know it. These are the results you get.
Slow and non-physical games. People criticizing ACC refereeing. Less basketball game attendance except for UNC. Fans from other conferences saying the ACC is crap now. ACC being less competitive outside of the ACC outside of UNC and Duke. Players (UNC and Duke) knowing that the can push the envelope in many various ways. Foul, walk, travel, or whatever.
Welcome to the conference of haves and have nots! Welcome to the "soft" ACC!
Anon. 8:30 pm, Scott is exactly right about Marshall's foul. He lowered his shoulder, drove it intentionally into Alex Johnson and floored him, to clear his way to the basket; only his shoulder went sideways! Scott is honest: for all of Howell's angry protest, that last moment no-call was correct.
I also agree with Scott on pt. 4 (on Henson). As for Duke, a classic example of "you live by the three (in some games), you die by the three (in others)".
Back to the Wolfpack: they definitely earned their NCAA invite.
Just watch the video.
By the definition of a block/charge, the Marshall no-call was closer to a block than a charge, but I think a no-call was appropriate. As for the Curry heave, am I the only one who saw him grab the ball and take off running without a single dribble? If you get a chance, watch it again. He just started running and then threw up the shot. There is no way it could have counted...although he walked pretty bad in the UNC game before making a 3 near the end of the game and they didn't call that one.
The little UNCheat moniker is pretty tired . Come up with something more creative to describe the stellar basketball program hat has een run without a hint of impropriety since Frank McGuire left around 1962. As to the officiating, the most absurd thing was to double the amount of time on the clock from .6 to 1.2. The game is 40 minutes. In the course of that 40 minutes, the clock stops and starts what maybe 100 times. If we added up every second or millisecond either way it probably ends up equal. In this case, there was clearly .6 of a second on the clock by the time the official signaled timeout and the clock was stopped. So, it makes it pretty annoying for someone to argue that Howell was fouled as the players fought over the loose ball. Anyway, congrats to State for a hard fought game. It will be good for the conference for them to have a legitimate team, which they will have under Gott.
State fans will complain about the calls, but when will you be honest and question why the coaching staff left their most productive player in the game with 4 fouls with over 8 minutes to go...then you turn the ball over on two straight trips down the court. Bone headed plays...
The view of the replay from the basket angle clearly showed the State player "humping" Marshall. He thrusted his mid section into Marshall as much as Marshall lowered a shoulder. Great no-call. And if the refs give Duke and NC all the calls how can it matter with them winning by double digits many times?
The ACC refs showed their UNC & Duke bias for the whole nation to witness today. Leslie's 4th foul and Marshall's last basket were identical plays, but both calls went UNC's way. The UNC player who stole the last pass landed out of bounds (no call) and Howell was fouled hard across the chest and arms (no foul). ACC Ref who called everything against NCST down the stretch tells Gottfried to "shut his Fing A** up. Can you imagine a Ref telling that to K or Roy? Then the last plays of Duke game - Rivers obvious push off (no call), Plumlee across end line while defending inbounds pass (no call), and Seth's 3 steps on shot (no call). If something isn't done, expect MD & GT to B1G, FSU & Clem or VT to SEC, and UVA, NCST to Big12 or Big East.
anonymous....you are an idiot...no way teams leave the conference. Please just go away and quit your whining.
If you think that Marshall's drive was not a charge, then OBVIOUSLY the charge whistled on Leslie for his 4th foul was wrong too. There's no other way to justify it except being a complete UNC homer. If Leslie's move was a charge (it wasn't) then Marshall's drive was DEFINITELY a charge (it was.)
Both calls were blown. Leslie's 3rd and 5th foul were legit, but his fourth was garbage, as was the no call on Marshall.
I agree that there should not have been a call at the end, the State player never had possession of the ball. State also had a dreadful turnover right after a TO in the last minute. Still, Marshall clearly lowered his shoulder and the defender was more set than the defender was against Leslie, who did not lower his shoulder.
Absolutely no way you can be unbiased and agree with the refs in both of those situations.
I wonder how much of today had to do with the memory of 'Karl Hess.' NCSU deserves better.
The NCSU fans were howling just as loud about how Justin Watts' foot "had" to be on the end line as they were about the Marshall no-call. But then someone posted a series of photographs taken in rapid succession by a News and Observer photographer clearly showing (a) Watts' feet weren't even close to the line and (b) a referee was about 3 feet away looking directly at Watts' feet. Without those photos, Scott Fowler would have had 11 points in his column, the 11th being that the refs blew the call on whether Watts was on the end line. And with Marshall's foul, two referees were looking directly at the play and both made the same no call. The day when the Observer publishes a Sports Section without an error is the day that Scott Fowler can second-guess a play were two officials were looking directly at the play and made the same call. Grow-up Fowler and stop this nonsense about how the referees are biased in favor of the better team. Is the Pulitzer Prize panel biased in favor of the New York Times or does the New Times have better writers than the Charlotte Observer?
It was pretty obvious on the broadcast that Watts wasn't out of bounds. There was another play where an NCSU player 'saved' the ball under his own basket and it bounced out of bounds first before going right to a Heel for a lay-in. It would have been UNC's ball either way but if the call had been correct at least NCSU would have been able to set their D.
I'm guessing the NCSU fans crying about Watts don't have HDTV ;) Either way, there were plenty of other 'questionable' calls that went against State to not have to cry about a legit good play by Watts.
Buncha Crybabies!!!! You Lose, We Win get over it. Go Heels! Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, Ric Flair
Winners never whine and whiners never win. If State wants to get back to the top of the ACC they need to focus on basketball. People have been complaining about refs since the 1950's. I remember people calling dick Paparo "duke" Paparo. It time to shut up. There can be a foul called on every possession in bball. I don't want big east games played in 40s and 50s. I don't want thug ball. Coaches who teach that or bring it into the league need to quit whining. Why would an nba talent stay in college ball when you have mugga ball going on all over the confernce with a chance to get hurt. Teams with less talent resort to "aggressive" play like state this year and then whine when they get called for it. Go get more talented players and quit whining.
Instead of complaining about officials, how bout Scott Wood makes more than 1 shot or hits a 3. In their losses, he's been awful. Fix that before complaining. Sidenote: Curry walked on the 3. It's the 5 millionth time either Curry or Rivers has walked and it hasn't been called.
Lets not forget how much the networks stand to lose if Carolina v Duke is not the championship game. If the game is close they'll get the calls. Don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise.
All you had to do to see how far the ACC has fallen was watch the Syr.-UConn Quarterfinal game in the BE. Tough, physical play with only real fouls called, not the ticky-tack, wussy variety as in the ACC. Crowd totally engaged, standing and shouting for the last 10-12 min. And the BE is only the 3rd best conf. this year. H. Barnes, called the best Freshman last year is waaaaaaay too soft for NBA-should stay another year.
Despite his size, strength and quickness he is afraid to drive and prefers launching rainbow 3's from 25 ft., like yesterday.

I dried some gourds we grew, so we can make gourd birdhouses. If you didn’t grow any yourself, you can probably find some in your area at a farmer’s market or even a craft shop.
Because of the number of steps involved and the drying time required between painting, we will probably start these at a meeting and then they can take them home to paint them. I’m also planning on having them already soaking when the meeting starts. Kids and a 10 percent bleach solution are not a good combination, so they can start at the point where they scrub the gourds with the soapy water.
Gourd Birdhouse
Depending on age and maturity, some of these steps might have to be done by an adult.
Materials:
- Dried gourd – “bottle gourd”
- bleach solution – one-part bleach and nine parts water
- Steel wool
- bucket with soapy water
- Old towel to dry the gourd
- Utility knife
- Spoon
- Hand drill
- Enamel paint or shellac or polyurethane
- Paint brush
Directions
- Soak the gourd in a bleach solution for 15 minutes. (This might be done by an adult rather than a youth.)
- Dry the gourd with the towel.
- Immediately clean the outside of the gourd using the steel wool and the soapy water.
- Dry the gourd again with the towel.
- With the knife, cut a 1 ½ inch diameter hole in the gourd, slightly above the halfway point on the “fat” part of the gourd. (This might also need to be done by an adult.)
- Use the spoon to remove any seeds or pith in the gourd.
- Drill a few holes in the bottom, for drainage.
- Drill two holes at the top of the gourd. Later you will feed the wire through these to make a hanger for the gourd..
- Coat the gourd with at least two coats of paint, shellac, or polyurethane, letting it dry 24 hours between applications.
- Feed a length of wire through the holes.
- Twist the ends of the wire together to form a hanger.
- Hang out on a tree and wait for some birds to move in.
Notes
The dried gourds might have some mold spots on them. This happens during the drying process. They can still be used.
You might need to redrill the holes a little after painting.
USE CAUTION WITH THE BLEACH AND THE UTILITY KNIFE!
A birder friend who showed this project to my Webelos recommends using shoe polish to seal the gourds instead of shellac. No drying time needed!

Since August 1st the Scarlet Knights have scored commitments from four-star prospects Kadeem Jack, Myles Mack and Derrick Randall as well as Dyke (Va.) Blue Ridge standout Malick Kone.
On Tuesday Rice added his fifth recruit to the fold when Jerome Seagears, of Red Springs (N.C.) Flora MacDonald Academy, gave him a verbal pledge for the 2011 class.
"Yes sir I did," Seagears said in a text to Scout.com.
"It's a done deal," Derrick Bond, the coach Flora MacDonald, said. "He's going to sign with Rutgers."
Seagears had scholarship offers from West Virginia, Cincinnati, DePaul, Seton Hall and Arizona were all involved with Seagears.
"It's a great fit," Bond said. "Coach Rice is going to build a program around him and him as the PG. The pieces that they have coming in and the style of play [were a factor]. Coach Rice sold it to him and made him feel very comfortable."
"The other schools didn't do anything wrong, but coach Rice just did everything right," he added.
A 6-foot-2, 175-pound lead guard, Seagears is rated as a three-star prospect and checks in at No. 19 on the 2011 point guard list.

Once it gets cold enough here in Anchorage for the lakes to freeze--what, like October? No I'm kidding (more around December) then the municipality begins taking care of the ice at Westchester Lagoon in downtown Anchorage.
Located at one of the most scenic spots in town, the lagoon gives you a view of the downtown high-rises and Cook Inlet. The area is big enough to accommodate a circular track, a hockey rink and a separate area for casual skating--with half the lagoon to spare. Yup, we do everything big here in Alaska.
They keep the ice clear and wet-mopped pretty much all winter and on Saturdays you get a special treat: they bring out the music and the bonfires. On the edge of the lagoon they set up fire barrels and speakers pipe out the music while you can skate for free--what a deal!
We took the kids last Saturday and everyone had a great time, it was Lillian's first time skating without the benefit of a wall to cling to and I spent most of the time coaxing her along on her shaky blades. She was pretty amazing in that I couldn't count how many times she fell--and fell hard--but she was always cheerful and determined and never seen to mind the bruises. Unlike Andrew who whimpered and wept about his bruised hiney all weekend ("Does this look infected to you?" "Do you think I broke something?" "What happens if I broke my bottom--how would they cast that?")
Here's a quick clip of her and me skating and I show it as an example of the spills she took. Go watch it and tell me your body wouldn't break into messy little pieces if you twisted and crashed like that. I wince just watching it.
Anyway, when she's determine she's pretty stubborn and the only way we could get her home was to promise to take her regularly so she could "get good like the little girl skating over there." Apparently she's as competitive as her parents.
I'll end with a panoramic clip of the lagoon if you're interested in how pretty it all is. And the beauty of the clip is that you can watch it from the comforts of your warm and toasty armchair--you won't have to brave the 5 degree temperatures that we did.

Great post, I love reading the stuff about Alaska.
That was a sore one :(
I went ice-skating recently and the only reason I didn't do the same was because of the barriers to cling onto. How come it seems more difficult when you get older?? When I was seven, I'm sure I was whizzing around...
Good God!! That is one brave gal, I am sure that if my arm twisted that way it would break!! Is she one black and blue girl today?
I just so love that I am getting to know someone who lives in Alaska and catch glimpses of life there! Thanks so much for taking the time to post clips and all! You have one brave girl there. It was 7 degrees when we woke up today and they delayed most of the schools for fear the kids would get frost bite waiting on the buses. Mine, being home schooled, are snug in their beds. I bet they don't cancel school for 7 degrees where you are!
It's amazing how flexible they are at that age. My girl takes CanSkate every Sunday and I cringe watching her.
Btw, good skating yourself! I'm a bad Canadian- I can't skate.
Again, you should be changing the title of your blog to why you should move up here with us! Very good skating for the both of you.
okay, see, this is the difference between alaska and chicago -- we *think* we're all tough about the cold but when it got down to -1 yesterday (to be fair, there was a -25 windchill to go with it), we all hid inside. you guys up there go skating!!! great post:-)
Ouch! What a brave girl to laugh it off!
I must admit, I'm (more than) a little jealous of those mountains in the background. I can't imagine having a view like that close-by. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty here too, but mountains? That is quite the luxury to a born-and-raised midwesterner like myself.
That looks so cool! My favorite memory of visiting Stockholm was when I got to walk out on frozen water, and not a man-made ice rink. It gets so cold up there that the North Sea freezes! It was totally cool.
wow, that ice looks so smooth! I tried skating on a pond once and it was so bumpy I didn't last long. You really make me want to move to Alaska, it has everything I love (except maybe the career opps)!
And if you do break your bum (or rather tailbone) they can't put a cast on it, and they can't do anything for the months of pain you are in for and the nagging ache that you'll experience for the rest of your life when you sit in the same position for more than 2 hours. So try to avoid breaking your tailbone ;)
Poor Lillian!
The quick thaw in early January was enough to break up the ice on the river here and it's not yet frozen solid again! We worry that people are still going to use their snowmobiles...
I lived in Juneau for a year when I was in second grade. Some of my best childhood memories, hands down were there......ice skating, jumping off the roof into snow, going to school and returning in the dark, staying up REALLY late all summer, the northern lights......Alaska has so many wonderful things.......you are lucky to be able to enjoy them! ;)
Wow. I wish we had something like that.
What is the stick for? Is that one of those fishing poles? Do you actually club the fish rather than catch them?
Cheers
It's a good thing kids are closer to the ground. Those falls always look so painful -- yet they bounce right back, don't they?
You've inspired me to find a rink and take my kids skating this week.
Maddy, I'm going to pretend you didn't say that. I mean I know you're not that close to Canada but even in your neck of the woods hockey sticks aren't that foreign :)
You are lucky to have such a wonderful outdoor area to skate in. It sounds like a lot of fun....
.....and it is beautiful..
(your daughter would have to teach me how to skate.....i am horrible.)
I'll stick with walls to hold onto.
I never got the hang of ice skating, since I have only done it a few times. We did roller skating where I grew up, which is much easier.
That's beautiful!
That looks like great fun! And extreme cold!
Angie
Oh, and the ice is so hard, too!
Actually, though, you slide when you hit, so it does make it a bit better. Right?
I remember my little brother learning how to skate. He would just drop and roll like a little turtle, but I don't know if he ever felt it.
The cold helps numb the pain, I guess.
Looks beautiful, but eXtremely c-c-cold! Your little gal is a trooper. What's up with that backwards twirl, Mom? Those are some "Michele Kwan" moves you've got going on!
I still maintain that kids are made of rubber, and that's why they can live through all of the childhood accidents. Great video! How fun to skate on a lake!
That looks awesome! Skating however is not for me. I don't fare very well!
Wow it's so gorgeous. It makes me miss living in WI, where I used to skate on the pond across from my apartment all the time. Here, no dice as it goes from deep freeze (currently single digits for the last few days) to mid-thirties and back again all winter long. Looks like such fun!
There are times when I would swear that kids' bones must be made of rubber to survive some of the spills they take. It looks like a lovely and fun time was had by all.
Wow that looks so nice! I love watching your videos!
Maria
What a beautiful pond! I'm scared to death of skating without a wall-- it is pretty embarrassing to be draggin myself along the wall, while little 7 year olds are skating circles around me:)
Uh, is Andrew your son or husband? Just kidding--- I could see a lot of husbands asking about casting their butt. Big Smile
Trixie
Beautiful. Simply beautiful. My parents talked about a possible move to Alaska, then ended up staying in Wisconsin. I can see why they wanted to move! They (and we kids, I'm sure) would've loved it.
Those pictures made me so homesick. The closest I've gotten to iceskating lately is when I forgot to turn off the sprinklers the night we got a hard freeze. The boys and I had fun sliding around on the thin sheet of ice that formed on our driveway. It almost makes me want to move back up.
I love ice skating at Westchester! I bring all my winter visitors there because it is such a neat place. If you go on a weekday, you can sometimes have the place to yourself. Nancy in Palmer.
I feel for lily and her falling that looked painful! We have a lake here that everyone goes to and it's been frozen over since December also.

This month my brother, Luke Nichols and his lovely wife Becca, came to visit and during one of several interesting conversations we had he spoke of his experiences as a criminal defense attorney in the Washington D.C. area.
Through his work he's seen some of the consequences of teenagers sexting (and if you don't know what sexting is, just ask any teen) and he has volunteered time at youth centers to warn teens of the dangers they face when the law gets involved.
You may already know of the dangers this new phenomenon poses to the morality of our children and society but you ought also to know of the legal dangers children face if caught--and if they have a cell phone I can pretty much guarantee you that they've have experience in the area already.
Luke joins us as a guest poster and legal opinion on the subject and you can read more about sexting on his website at Spectrum Legal Defense.
P.S. Don't let the picture distract you--I just wanted a picture of Luke and this one of Lillian and him goofing it up and celebrating their fishing success cracks me up.
What Is Sexting?
While the moral, psychological, and religious implications of sexting deserves their own discussion, I am a criminal defense attorney and what I am qualified to tell you is 1) that sexting is rampant and 2) sexting can land a child in prison for years.
Sexting, or sexual texting, is an epidemic that involves using the internet and usually camera phones to share sexually explicit photos, text, and video. While not all youths are willful participants in this seedy conduct, the popularity of camera phones now means that nearly all young people are exposed to sexting whether they like it or not.
Legally speaking, the problem is that sexting is the wholesale production and distribution of child pornography within our homes and schools. When a fourteen year-old boy takes picture of his thirteen year-old girlfriend’s breast he has committed felony production of child pornography and the separate felony of possession of child pornography. If that young man or any of his friends display, copy, or share that image then they are guilty of a third felony, distribution of child pornography. If that boy or anyone else requested or enticed the minor to expose her breasts he may also be guilty of aggravated sexual battery or felony child molestation among other crimes.
While each state is different, there are few places in the US were child pornography and other sex crimes against minors are not ruthlessly punished and prosecuted. Parents should also keep in mind that because the internet crosses state lines child pornography is frequently prosecuted in federal courts as a federal crime.
In some states, the maximum punishment for just production of child pornography is 30 years in an adult prison facility. What is more onerous, in many states each photo can result in a separate charge, so that a young man or woman who takes multiple photos will be charged with multiple counts of production, possession, and distribution.
One of my more recent juvenile clients was caught with twelve pictures of his naked seventeen year-old girlfriend. He was charged will twelve counts of possession of child pornography and faces up to sixty years in jail.
So How Big of a Deal Is It?
The mistake that most adults make is that they do not realize how serious these crimes are. The first sexting case I ever worked on involved a seventeen year-old boy who used his camera phone to take a video of his naked thirteen year little brother and friend during a hazing prank. Even though the boys willingly went along with the hazing and even though my client was not accused of intending anything sexual (just humiliation) my client was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual battery for enticing two minors to take their clothes off, one count of production of child pornography, one count of possession, and one count of distribution after he showed the video to his friends.
Those charges allowed the court to try the young man as an adult and carried a maximum penalty of 104 years in prison and a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison. The boy was fortunately only found guilty of some of the charges and was sentenced to 3 years in prison.
But My Kid Doesn't Sext . . .
What I find so disturbing about sexting is just how common it is, yet the only adults who seem to understand this are the police and prosecutors. One recent trial for possession of child pornography involved a young man in his late teens. The police were chatting with this young man when the officers asked to see his cell phone. The officers searched the phone and discovered a naked photo of the teen’s seventeen year-old girlfriend. When I asked the officer why he searched his phone the officer looked at me like I was an idiot and said “All teenagers have naked photos of their girlfriends on their cell phone."
While the officer’s statement is somewhat of an overstatement, I have since discovered that he was not far off the mark. In the last year, I have since started speaking with high school students and teen intervention groups about the dangers of sexting and I have consistently found the practice of sexting utterly unchecked by adults. Every time I speak at a school about sexting, without fail many of the young men laugh or brag about the practice openly in front of their teachers or supervisors and almost none of the youth are unfamiliar with it. Getting a naked photo of a girl is simply “first base” for too many young men now days.
While the girls’ attitudes about sexting are not usually so cocky or jovial they are equally as exposed to the practice. In the short time I have been speaking to youths I have heard too many accounts of young girls being forcibly exposed and photographed by young men with camera phones at school. Often, these girls have said nothing about these attacks because, like the young men, they think that shoving a camera phone up a girl’s skirt and posting it on the web is a mean prank not a felony.
Many of the youths I speak to are good kids who feel no attraction to sexting, but they are still exposed to it. With a few clicks their friends and often distant acquaintances send them dirty photos. Naked photos of fellow class mates are now the new medium for youths to boast about their conquests or to humiliate and shame one another. While certain girls in my high school did things in private for attention, similar young women of this generation can garnish the wrong kind of attention from hundreds of boys with a camera phone and 30 seconds.
Few teenagers today have not been exposed to child pornography via sexting, and what they don’t realize is that the simple possession of those materials is a felony regardless of whether they approve of or despise the practice.
Sexting Is a Loaded Gun or a Pound of Cocaine
Legally speaking, child pornography is no different than guns and drugs. If you are caught with it, it doesn’t matter what your intentions were, you are going to jail. Additionally, most people do not realize that putting child pornography in your computer’s trash bin does not solve the problem. If there is any way you can retrieve the pornographic photo after you have deleted it, then you are still in possession.
Many courts have taken this to extremes and will find possession even if retrieving the images requires a computer expert. A common example includes the temporary files created on your computer when you view images on the internet. The police catch online pedophiles by monitoring sites which contain child pornography. They accumulate data on who has viewed the photos and when they finally shut down the site they round up all the visitors’ computers and have computer forensic scientist retrieve the temporary files created by surfing the internet. Many of the social networking sites and chat rooms popular with youth contain indecent photos of minors, and the law does not distinguish between an internet user who ogles young girls and one who was is simply reading their friend’s online profile. If it is on your computer, you are in trouble.
When teachers ask me what they should do when (not if) they find child pornography on their students' phones I tell them to treat it like a loaded gun or a kilo of cocaine. Don’t handle it. Don’t examine it. Just call security or the police immediately! No matter what happens, never ever give a child their phone or computer back if you know there is any pornography on it. Giving pornography (not just child pornography) to a minor is a serious crime and I am not aware of any law that makes exceptions for giving a kid back their own pictures.
It Can Come Back to Haunt Them
Inevitably, when I discuss sexting with youths, there are those who balk at my cautions because they don’t think they will ever get in trouble. Everyone around them is doing it so why worry?
What they don’t realize is that sexting is a new problem. Adults are learning and each year the numbers of children arrested grow as more people report incidents to law enforcement. Also, in many state there is no statute of limitation for these types of felonies. This means that the government can bring charges against a person 20 years after the crime was committed if they want to. Many child molesters are prosecuted only after their victims are grown and come forward as adults. Likewise, a young man who coerces a young woman to expose herself may not get reported to police until the girl has grown and has become old enough to know that what was done to her was illegal.
I tell young men that when they take dirty photos of a girl, that girl has complete control over their fate. If she ever gets angry and wants to hurt them all she has to do pick up the phone and call the police.
However, the more common way youths are being arrested is when their dirty photos are passed around until a responsible adult sees the pictures and calls the police. All the police have to do is threaten the last sender with felony possession and distribution of child pornography unless they tell them where they got the photos. Getting teenagers and parents to talk is easy when children are facing up to 10-20 years in prison.
Some police are also searching phones as a regular part of criminal investigations. One of my young clients was falsely accused of assault and battery after defending himself from a gang attack. When he was arrested the police inventoried his possession and discovered multiple dirty photos of his underage girlfriend on his cell phone. The police quickly realized that he was the real victim and dropped the assault and battery charges; however, they went forward with over ten counts of felony possession of child pornography.
Is There Any Protection?
Obviously sexting is dangerous, but the real question is: what can be done to protect children? To parents, I would like to point out the vast majority of the sexting cases involve camera phones, and I cannot think of a reason that a sixteen year old needs a camera on their phone.
Additionally, I think half of my clients are in trouble because of whom they associate with. Know your children’s online and real world friends. There are only two ways I know of to find out who your child associates with online: either you monitor their online activity or you ask them (I recommend both).
Finally, there is no substitute for talking openly and frankly to your children about the consequences of sexting. And while I can only address the legal ramifications, it is up to parents to weigh in on the moral, emotional, and religious implications of online sexual activity.
And if all of that fails, liquidate their college fund and hire a good attorney.

My kids are too young to have cell phones or even ask for one. (And after this article, I'm not sure they'll ever have one.)(At least, not for a long, long time.)
But man, this is important stuff. Thank you!
Sent here by Kelly. This solidifies my desire to keep my kids phone free as long as possible.
Thank you for this information. I'll be passing it on.
Thank you for this excellent article! I have posted it on FB for my friends.
My 15 year old daughter would like to have a phone, of course, but so far there is no need for it.
i'm posting this on FB. thanks for the info!
Thank you so much for this information. I never knew...!
WOW!!!!
Scary stuff!!!!
I hadn't even thought about any of that before. Fortunately my girls are only 2 and 5 so I have a while until they get cell phones... but this is so terrifying. I had no idea of all the legal ramifications and I'm sure the mother's of most teens have no idea either.
Thank you for publishing this post.
GREAT point about not needing a camera on a phone. Actually, great points all around. My daughter is only 2, so I can only imagine the dangers we'll face in 10 years. But it's good to stay educated along the way, even if it seems like our time for dealing with this is so far off!
A boy in my daugther's class had a naked photo of a girl and was telling/showing fellow classmates it was my daughter. It was not my child and my daughter was so freaked out that she went to the administration. They did nothing (they did look at the photo)and when my husband spoke to the asst. prinicipal about it, the matter was bascially disimissed.
Forgot to add that the photo was on his phone.
Very few of the criminal cases I have seen were intialized by teachers or administrators. This is frankly dangerous behavior for teachers who are coming in contact with child porn.
AN asst principle in a local county was recently charge with poss of child porn after he confiscated dirty photos from boy in the school as part of a sextibg crack down. He got into trouble because the priciples didn't report anything. The charges were eventually dismissed but only after $150,000 in legal fees and a year of his life were gone.
Wonderful article- I'm passing along to my friend who is also a middle school teacher- she's already had some experience in this area sadly.
Steph
As a teacher, I've passed every instance of sexting along to my superiors. Unfortunately, by and large, no one wants to deal with it. Either the kids aren't called downstairs in a timely manner (i.e. enough time for them to delete said pictures) or the they're given second chances. This has led to a middle school where, ultimately, I believe the majority of students ARE sexting. It's frustrating and I wish that parents would step up and see that their children don't need smart phones and they DO need to check their children's text messages, every single day. It's certainly not limited to any one group of kids, either. They don't think of the ramifications and don't realize that sending a nude picture IS wrong. It's so sad.
It falls into the "...can't happen to me" immortal feeling of being a teen. "Everybody does it" doesn't hold up in court. Thank you for the straightforward summary!
An eye-opener, to be sure. Thanks for this valuable informatoin.
Well with kids 6 and under I was totally naive to the existence of any of this. I have sent this on! Thanks so much for the article.
I oppose any force, coercion, or manipulation in getting anything from anyone, especially minors. That said,
This writer is so excited he found a way to prosecute young people who are intending no harm. Let's not conflate real predators and abusers with every teen with a naked photo on his or her phone. I've heard of teens being accused of producing child pornography for photographing themselves! This is clearly an unintended consequence of a good intentioned law.
Shame on cops who use any excuse to search a teen's phone for incriminating evidence.
I guess I should thank the author for pointing out this horrible miscarriage of justice. But I wish the lesson was one of changing the system, not scaring parents.
It reminds me of when a community found an old law prohibiting untethered horse carts and used it to outlaw skateboards. Only in that case the worst that would happen was a fine, he is talking about jail time!
The answer is we need to discourage abusive behavior with reason and proportion, not put innocent kids or adults in jail. This is pathetic.
Scholz - you probably didn't read the preface close enough. The writer is a DEFENSE ATTORNEY - NOT a PROSECUTOR. He is defending these teens. While I agree that at times maybe the punishment is too severe, do you really want to say that someone who is distributing naked photos of underage children are innocent? Most kids today have no concept of accountability. Besides - when does it become OK to distribute naked photos of someone? Where do YOU want to draw the line? Is it OK if the person in the photo agrees? If the person you're sending the photo to agrees? That's the same argument that against statutory rape. Children can't by law give consent for those types of things.
You say these individuals are intending no harm. Would you still be defending it if it was your 13 year old daughter and her boyfriend was showing nude photos of her to all his friends?
Outlawing skateboards is completely different and shame on you for thinking that skateboarding and distributing pornography are equal wrongs. Its attitudes like yours that contribute to this problem and encourage teens to think that this is OK behavior.
Carinne,
I am arguing that child pornography laws are designed to protect children from abusive adults.
Of course, there are going to be gray areas, how old is adult or child etc. Is there coercion, is there pressure, etc..
I agree that statutory rape is an interesting case. I would argue that cases of consensual photo exchanges be treated roughly the same.
I am not an attorney, so I don't know the exact penalties. But many states have Romeo and Juliet provisions so that similarly ages teens (or pre-teens) who give (non-legal) consent, and do not press charges against the other, are held to have committed less serious offense than when an adult abuses a child.
The idea that one should continue punish an adult who as a teen fooled around with her boyfriend is pretty absurd (especially if neither complains). Likewise the idea that one should be as holding onto child pornography as an adult for pictures taking consensually as a teen.
If my daughters send nude pictures to anyone, I would be pretty angry. Do I think the person who receives the pictures should go to jail, if it isn't an adult? No. I would want to talk to all those involved, and their parents. Just like if I catch them having sex before age 18. I wouldn't send them to jail, unless the elements of abuse, force or coercion where there, would you?
Scholtz-
The point is that when you're dealing with digital photos, video, text, etc there is no way to control it. Someone takes a nude photo of their underage girlfriend, 1) there is no way to really know/prove that he actually had her consent and wasn't coerced and 2) once its digital it can suddenly be distributed all over the internet and it will never be contained or disappear. That's a horrible thing to have happen to someone against their will, knowledge, consent,etc.
I still stand by my statement that by defending the behavior you're contributing to it.
Yeah Scholz I only use the law unjustly against minors when there is a pay check attached. No pro Bono tyranny for me : )
There is however a sticky point to this debate. There are two main reasons for the Strictness of child porn laws. 1) it is to prevent the sexual exploitation of child during the production of this material and 2) protect children by banning material which may arrose or even cause pedophilic-addiction or behaviors.
Then ask, is the exploitation of children via sexting compareable to that of traditional child porn? And does child porn produced via sexting distinguishable from the traditional type once it's been posted on the Internet etc.?
I think there are legislative solutions to these problems but frankly its politically dangerous to lead the charge softening child porn laws and I believe that a significant part of the USA is not sad about the current state of the law regarding child porn....or skate boarding.
I am going to leave the discussion. I think there are some interesting issues. I hope people continue to discuss it. Carrine accused me of supporting child pornography, and I can't have a meaningful discussion in that context, especially after I clearly said I opposed that.
She also asked how I'd feel if my daughters were photographed nude presumably against their wills. I will leave her to think about what she'd do if she found one naked picture on her 15 year old son's phone. I can only assume she would report him to the local, state and federal authorities. If she didn't she would be as bad as me!
Scholz
Sorry I offended you. I never accused you of supporting child pornography. I accused you of adding to the problem by saying 'there is no problem'. I guess I was just amazed that someone would think this was all 'no big deal'. Maybe I read your original comment in the wrong way. I took issue with 2 things you said in your original comment:
"This writer is so excited he found a way to prosecute young people who are intending no harm. Let's not conflate real predators and abusers with every teen with a naked photo on his or her phone."
1st - you were accusing the writer of something that he clearly was not doing. He's defending these kids - not trying to find ways to prosecute them.
2nd - the fact that you said they aren't intending harm and those who distribute nude photos and video against someone's will or consent or (in many cases) knowledge are not real predators.
Your statement is the reason why these kids do this. They don't believe its a big deal, wrong, illegal or harmful. By declaring that not only is it not harmful but also shouldn't be prosecuted, you are contributing to the problem. I'm still amazed by that.
I caught the tail of the comments late here but maybe I can help, Scholz--I think you maybe misread things because the writer isn't involved in prosecuting teens but defending. He's a defense attorney. Besides that, he works with intervention groups to educate teens about what the laws say and the risks teens run when they sext.
However, you are correct when you say that some states have different laws and different penalities. It's a state issue except when prosecuted as a felony, such as when it crosses state lines.
This post isn't really a comment on the morality of the law itself but a caution of one more reason that sexting is a dangerous affair.
It's not really fair to insinuate how a parent may or may not feel if their child were exploited and it, too is off point (Carinne).
Personally? I support stiff laws against pornography, drugs, etc. but do understand that when you have these stiff penalities--particularly with mandatory minimum sentencing and things like that--that you run the risk of over punishing and creating criminals through running decent kids who made dumb-yet-illegal mistakes through the penal system.
Unfortunately the system is flawed and the closer you come to trying to prepare for all eventualities the more you get diminishing returns.
But again, that's not really the point here--it's merely to show parents that sexting is legally dangerous. If this post wakes parents up to the things their kids are facing nowadays then I think it's been useful. Information is never a bad thing--and then if people such as you, Scholz, feel the laws are wrong then at least with a bit of knowledge they can lobby to have them changed, right?
If nothing else it may help us all to get an interest in what our own state's particular laws are on the subject and become better informed.
Thanks for your comments.
Thank you for bringing attention to this issue - this generation of kids is far more tech savvy than we will ever be. It goes to show how important it is to talk openly with your kids, to listen, and to check up on them.
As a mother of teen boys, this is a major issue. Kids are clueless as to the ramifications of this particular activity. Not only should every parent read this, but every teenager with a cell phone!
Even though you are required to purchase a data plan if you buy a certain phone, you can still block both texting AND data from any phone on your plan. I blocked ALL data from our phones, and all texting on kids' phones.
If Verizon is going to require data plans, then I won't have a Verizon phone anymore after this contract is up, though as I refuse to pay for something I don't use.
I really think the law should be tweeked when it comes to minors and their girl/boyfriends. AFter all, in the '70's, it was boys with their parents' polaroid cameras taking pics of their girlfriends. Granted it didn't get distributed to the whole world via the internet, but it got shown around the local high school.
This is not a "new sin", but the technology adds some very dangerous elements.
glad to be visited in this blog..
Here is a link to another blog article I did on how to use cell carrier parental controls and available parental monitoring services.
Luke Nichols
Michelle,
You would think this would be easy to control. Have the phone carriers block a phones ability to send pictures via text messaging.
The main problem is that these kids will still find other ways of distributing the pictures if not by cell phone, than digital pictures on their cameras and swapping memory sticks with their friends.
This is just one of the circumstances where technology is being used for criminal activities and not at all for what we designed it for.
Love and Hugs ~ Kat
Sentence that really stood out to me:
"What I find so disturbing about sexting is just how common it is, yet the only adults who seem to understand this are the police and prosecutors."
Wake up, parents!
Such an important issue...one that cannot be ignored. Thanks for getting these conversations going in homes across America.
stephanie@metropolitanmama.net
thanks for this article and to Luke for taking the time and effort to tell kids about the dangers.
I agree that sexting, AKA 'sxting' is a huge problem, but it is more of an all-around problem. This article seems slanted more towards the idea that boys are the main culprit in this situation. With lines like:
" ... young girls being forcibly exposed and photographed by young men ... " and,
"I tell young men that when they take dirty photos of a girl, that girl has complete control over their fate."
In all fairness it should be stated that in certain cases it isn't always the implied boy who is the sole aggressor, forcing the female into situations that she doesn't want to be in or doesn't understand. In some cases it is the girls themselves that instigate the so-called sexting, sending a photo -- unasked for -- directly to the boy. Whether or not they think they are just being sexy, flirty, or even if they think that is what "couples" do for each other, it simply isn't always the fault of the young man in these cases. Some girls try to emulate the activities of their other female friends, sort of a "so and so sent a dirty photo to her BF, so I should do the same for mine" type of situation.
I'm only bringing this up so that it isn't just the parents of young boys who feel the responsibility to stop this sort of thing. Let your daughters know as well that sending off photos like that isn't just unacceptable, it's illegal.
I worked in the Anchorage school district for years, and I've seen this sort of activity among students as early as middle school, and that was some years back. I can only imagine how much worse it is now, with most kids carrying photos these days.
By the way, while I'm here I might as well add my two cents about another long-standing problem, which is webcams. I'm sure all parents are aware by now of the dangers of letting your children go onto the internet unsupervised, but what you may not be familiar with is some of the new technology that makes it easier than ever for a child to get themselves into a dangerous situation.
There are websites these days that let you instantly start up a webcam show for a limitless group of strangers. A few clicks of the mouse and your kids could be the star of their own public cam show, and many of the viewers might be predators.
You don't have to actually purchase a separate camera these days, often they are built directly into laptops and netbooks, and some parents aren't even aware that the webcam is there.
Again, this isn't the behavior of years ago where you had to physically "add" someone to your MSN, or Yahoo programs before you could talk and webcam, these are simply internet sites that interact with the camera - and some of these newer sites are "anonymous", meaning you don't know who you are talking to until the video starts (and then in MANY cases your child will suddenly realize there is a naked adult on the screen).
This is a newer trend, and I'm sure your teens have already heard and probably participated in it, even if they didn't anticipate the chance they might see things they had no desire to see. Just ask them if they've ever heard of "Stick AM", or "Chatroulette".
Technology is changing so fast, it's hard to keep on top of this stuff. Just be aware.
Wow, a very good article. Lots of info that I had no idea about. Thank you for posting this..
My fifteen and twelve year old's have been lobbying for phones for a while now. And, seriously, they are the only kids know who don't have their own phones.
I have a hard enough time keeping up with their facebook pages, which I do allow them to have since there are so many adult friends and family members on there also who keep an eye on the content.
I appreciate this article, it gave me a lot to think and talk about with my kids.
Interesting! Thanks for the informative article! I just saw this "related" article today in my local paper...!
Funny, we recently got a cell for our daughter and these concerns were/are very real for me. We even typed up a contract and made her sign it...it's hanging in our kitchen so that we can refer to it often. I told my daughter it's not even that I don't trust her it's that I know the part of her brain that controls logic and reasoning isn't fully developed yet so things she might think are good ideas could have some hefty consequences.
My 14 year old has had a cell phone for 2 years now. We just got texting for them this year. I love the texting, but yeah am really debating on dropping the picture sharing capability she has for this reason.
I did send her this link when I found it and told her if she didn't read it I was taking the phone away completely. So, after some flack, she at least read it, so at least she knows about it. Now if only she will keep a level head. Yeah, I know, I can dream right?
Thank you - this information is really important. We have three boys and I am sure that in some way this issue will raise itself. I am already amazed by what I see kids send as text messages to each other - not necessarily explicit but offensive in other ways.
A related area which is on the rise is the bullying via mobile phone (cellphone). We've not had this experience but I know other people who have. I think as parents we need to talk more to our kids about what they can do if they receive any threatening or uncomfortable text messages on their phone. Something I think about often is not over-reacting. If teens think their parents have a tendency to over-react to information then they are even less likely to tell us that they are receiving disturbing text messages.
But back to sexting - I guess this has become prevalent because it's a facade or protection behind which self-conscious teenagers can hide - or where it is bullying, then it's an opportunity for the bully to try and hide behind the technology.
We have allowed our two young teens to have 'phones but we are vigilant about their use and we try to talk to them about what they may and may not do with it. One thing we are clear on is that it is not okay to take ANY kind of picture with your phone and send it anywhere (let alone Facebook) without permission. We've talked about privacy and legal issues - but it's fair to say that there are no guarantees. I have my fingers crossed and will keep the communication lines open in hope!
Thanks for this, Michelle. I'll be sending this to all of my friends! Our kids are on the young side (mostly 7-11 year olds,) and don't have phones yet but this is SO important to know going forward.
I'm grateful you posted this. It's very interesting to see where people fall out on this subject. --A thought: Just because this is an "old" sin, does that make it okay? And why on earth do we feel sorry for boys who take pictures of their girlfriends, even with consent (or vice-versa), and then distribute it to friends *knowing* that there is no way to stop it once it gets out there? I have absolutely NO SYMPATHY for ANYONE exploiting ANYONE, regardless of AGE or RELATIONSHIP. Teenagers have always had sex, that doesn't mean it's right, and that doesn't mean that I condone it.
My kids are too young to have their own phones, but when the time comes, they will be getting phones without picture-taking features!
BTW, can a teen refuse to show his phone to a police officer if he doesn't have a warrant?

Jonathan Segal’s The North Parker is coming to 30th and Upas, and here’s a rendering out of the San Diego Business Journal (account required)
. The project includes 4 retail suites totaling 6000 square feet, 27 2-bedroom rentals, and office space that will house Segal’s architecture firm. The design is reminiscent of Segal’s black building on India Street in Little Italy.
Over in Kensington, demolition work has begun on the gas station at Marlborough and Adams where Kensington Terrace was planned until the market cratered. Looks like the project has undergone a name change to Kensington Commons; about all you’ll find online is this structural info page and a lease listing promising 7 retail units totaling 10,000 square feet. As a Kensington resident who’s watched Normal Heights blow up the past few years I’m looking forward to some more dining options around the corner.
On a related note, we made a return visit to Polite Provisions and it has to rank up there with Blind Lady Ale House as The Best Thing to Ever Happen on Adams (At Least Since We’ve Lived Here). There’s nothing nearby that rivals the unique interior they’ve put together, from the beautiful marble bar, to the detailed standing light fixtures, to the large vertically-folding windows. And you’re not going to find a better selection of amazing cocktails in the neighborhood either; new rum-based offering “Beach House” was another dangerously tasty offering. Having just watched Flight I’m concerned PP is going to turn me into Denzel Washington’s character.
Elsewhere: El Take it Easy has been reincarnated as Hubcap; while it’s already open, the official Grand Opening is Thursday May 9th. Grass-fed burger and a pint of Saint Archer all month for $15… Eater says BBQ 81 is coming to the
former original Pomegranate spot on El Cajon Boulevard… And more restaurants have been named for the Police Headquarters project downtown: Seasons 52 and Jimmy V’s.
Another chapter was added to the epic Plaza de Panama saga last week with Mayor Filner’s new proposal to close Cabrillo Bridge on weekends and restrict weekday traffic to the southwest corner of the plaza. The plan, detailed here, would free up the majority of the plaza as a gathering place for pedestrians, complete with landscaping, movable chairs/tables, and access to the fountain there. The bridge closure is set for late next month; handicapped spaces will move to the Alcazar Garden lot and valet parking will retreat to the “secret” lot behind Casa de Balboa.
Rather than rehash the details of a plan already discussed elsewhere, it’s worth noting the improbability of this scenario. Who would have thought that Irwin Jacobs’ plan for Plaza de Panama, which involved substantial sums of donated money, concrete, and chutzpah, would be rejected? Certainly not the city council that voted for it; the city attorney and council president that sought to re-write the city charter to nullify the plan’s loss in court; the Republican mayoral candidate funded by Democrat Jacobs after Democratic mayoral candidate Filner opposed it; the wealthy newspaper owner who repeatedly editorialized for it; the former mayor who helped hatch it; nor the park institutions who put their own financial interests over the citizens of San Diego who partly maintain the park with their tax dollars. With the Jacobs plan finally out of the way, Mayor Filner stepped in with a modified version of the Stepner-Blackson plan and 1989 Master Plan, one that emphasizes flexibility and testing. It’s an amazing contrast to the my-way-or-the-highway approach from Jacobs, who seemed oblivious to the damage his auto-focused plan inflicted on the park.
Reaction to the mayor’s plan by the Balboa Park Committee and the audience in attendance last week was largely positive. One notable exception was committee member Michael Hager, head of the Natural History Museum and author of a particularly misleading Voice of San Diego op-ed supporting the Jacobs plan, which included this gem:
Yet this exciting opportunity has been marred by the opposition of a small group of people who would derail any public improvement that doesn’t meet its narrow definition of purity..
In response, Mayor Filner suggested marketing the museums to pedestrians and cyclists in addition to drivers. Here’s one marketing idea: museum discounts for anyone who rides the park tram (new trams ordered for the Jacobs plan arrived this week). That could bring in visitors who weren’t otherwise aware of the variety of institutions in the park.
Another complaint cites increased traffic and parking in Bankers Hill on weekends due to the bridge closure. As others have said, both Golden Gate and Central Park close on the weekends, so why should San Diego be any different? Do the rights of Bankers Hill residents to find easy street parking outweigh those of all the visitors to the Park? From VOSD: …
Bankers Hill is located between the vibrant neighborhoods of downtown and uptown, next to the “nation’s largest urban cultural park”. Why would residents expect street parking to be plentiful? If you want the amenities of a large city, one sacrifice is often cheap parking. There are plenty of quiet suburbs in San Diego featuring vast free on-street parking; perhaps Mr. Hamilton would be happier there.
Besides, there are parking options on the west side of the park. Re-stripe the western streets/lots in the park for more parking. Reduce 6th Avenue to one lane in each direction with angled parking. Place signage on the west side of the park with directions to Park Blvd lots and park access. Put QR codes on the signs so folks can import the directions to their smart phone mapping apps. Long-term, build a parking garage at Inspiration Point with tram service.
Speaking of costly projects, it wouldn’t hurt to consider alternate sources of funding for the mayor’s plan. Remember, Todd Gloria rejected Filner’s prior request for funds to study this plan, and on this and other issues he’s favored his own political advancement via campaign contributions over his constituents. So, how about a fundraiser to do the landscaping right in the plaza (and across from the Museum of Man while we’re at it)? Sell engraved bricks/pavers in the plaza, or start a civic crowdfunding project.
As someone who pouted over the city’s approval of the Jacobs plan for months I understand how emotions can run high over the city’s crown jewel. Let’s hope the mayor’s plan proceeds successfully while remaining flexible to suggestions and change.
- Linkage:
Good article! The objections raised to the mayor’s plan can reasonably be addressed with energetic planning, educating the public, signage, redirection and restriping. I remember the wailing and gnashing of teeth when closing of Third Street to automobiles was proposed in Santa Monica. A lot of the same arguments were presented. Today it is hard to find anyone who’d admit they ever opposed the idea. Here someday we’ll probably read one of the nay sayers take credit for the whole concept presented by the mayor!
I watched the YouTube video of the Mayor’s presentation. Very exciting. And you are spot on with this observation: .”
Doing Pavers with names on from donors–large and small–is a great idea. That may be a later phase. But important to do all we can to make Filner’s promise of removing the Parking in time for this Memorial Day weekend!

Why does the website still promote the Jacobs Plan for Balboa Park??
This publically funded website should be giving updates information on the Filner Plan to remove parking from Plaza de Panama, including new circulation routes, locations for parking, and the hours of closure of Cabrillo Bridge. Write to them via the “contact” link at the Website and tell them to post the updates NOW.
same reason Google still lists Jerry as Mayor…. they still cant believe they lost!
Could be because mayor Bob is not great at the details of being mayor (yet). 1 million details every day that the strong mayor is in charge of. Being in congress is good for gaining name recognition, but not much of a training ground for being a CEO. He has never had to deal with that level of detail in his career and it is a daunting task for those who are skilled and experienced at it.
It is one of the reasons “outsiders” often struggle when brought in to run a large organization. Mayor Bob and his team are still on a steep steep learning curve and it is early in his term. Hope for his sake, and the city’s, he can pick it up soon. 12:49 pm
Mr. Younger: The website is not a city-owned site, but private. Owned by the commercial tenants and museums in the Park. Most of them supported the Jacobs Plan, in part so they could have MORE parking, more Valet Parking, and because Jacobs gave thousands in contributions [aka bribes] to foster support. The website carried an ad and link supporting the Jacobs Plan for almost 3 years, at great cost to Jacobs. This had nothing to do with any lack of attention to details by Filner, but by resistance and opposition from commercial tenants and Jacobs money. The tenants wanted to convert the Park to a shopping center. The public felt otherwise.
Hi Mark,
I see that it’s changed now. Turns out the mayors staff does have some influence with balboapark.org after all. This is the kind of thing that the mayors staff will get better and better at, but it’s not something that they have had to do before. Good intentions just not experienced at what it takes to handle the details. I’m a believer that they will get better, they almost always do.
May 2nd, 2013 at 11:45 pm
Thanks for all the comments everyone. I’m excited for this project and glad to see it’s now up on the balboapark.org site! If we do actually get Cabrillo Bridge closed on weekends, I’m hoping residents and visitors will both come to see what a great pedestrian extension of the plaza we could have. I especially liked a comment on VOSD:.
April’s the month where outdoor events really get going again in San Diego. This past weekend featured Balboa Park Earth Day, Taste of Hillcrest and City Beat’s Festival of Beers in North Park. Next weekend brings Adams Ave Unplugged, Mission Federal’s Art Walk in Little Italy, and the Creek to Bay Cleanup throughout San Diego. It’s like the city waking up from a long, mild, winter hibernation. .. followed up by an extended nap through the pending May gray.
Things are pretty lively indoors too, with a bunch of new establishment announcements. San Diego magazine reports Alex Thao (Celadon, Rama, and briefly, Chow) is opening Lucky Liu’s, a “classic Chinese” place just down the street from our miniature Chinatown on 4th downtown. It’ll be open until 3AM and serve Dim Sum on weekends; tentatively opening in July. Dim Sum in downtown San Diego? That’s something different.
Eater brings the excellent news that Ballast Point is opening a tasting room and mini-brewery (5-barrel system) in northern Little Italy that will serve as a testing grounds for new recipes. With Bottlecraft just down the street that’s one more reason to hit up this part of NOLI.
Speaking of breweries, Modern Times Beer met their Kickstarter goal of $40K to take their operation to another level with a killer tasting room, aged barrels for sour beers, and lab equipment for yeast development. Then they topped it off with a pledge to donate $2K to bikesd.org if they reach their next goal of $52K, which they’re closing in on. I know Jacob from MT is serious about making San Diego an even better place to live for when we choose not to drive, so it’s great to see ideas like this.
That reminds me of the Transit San Diego folks, who are also more interested in improving our quality of life instead of our vehicle flow rates. While I was disappointed to see they’re opposed to SANDAG’s plan for long-distance Bus Rapid Transit, I do admire their reasoning – that BRT out to North County only promotes sprawl, and that we should focus on light rail in the city core instead. While I’d love to see North County empty out and downtown/uptown soar with higher densities (not a sentiment shared by everyone), it’s probably not going to happen anytime soon, so why not give these commuters a transit alternative?
Regardless of what happens with BRT, back in uptown there’s a sense that things just keep getting better. Successful new businesses are opening left and right, and I’m seeing more cyclists and pedestrians on the roads and sidewalks every weekend. Positive developments like the Hillcrest shuttle and the CicloSDias walk/bike event in August are signs that many uptowners are looking beyond their cars to get them around the vibrant neighborhoods they live in.
A few days back I saw this tweet about a proposed public transit-adjacent project in Highland Park, near Pasadena. The project would put 80 units onto existing parking lots next to the Gold Line:
The project in question is the Highland Park Transit Village, and while it looks like an abomination of architecture, that’s a separate issue from the main reason for local opposition. Any kind of growth that results in increased density is forbidden; plus, “they’re going to take away our parking”.
LA has been making huge advances recently in expanding public transit (see their 30/10 plan that performs 30 years of construction in 10 years, a plan completely contradictory to SANDAG’s vision for our region) and building smart-growth mixed-use residential/commercial projects along these lines. When you think about it, there isn’t much choice for LA – they’ve sprawled themselves into a traffic-choked nightmare, and where is the future growth going to go – the Mojave Desert? The only solution is to increase density wisely throughout the city, along existing and new transit lines. San Diego, sprawled from sea to mountains, from Camp Pendleton to Mexico, isn’t much different at this point.
Unfortunately there are a lot of people who are unwilling to increase density in their neighborhoods to accommodate this type of smart growth. They got there first, they enjoy the convenience of their auto-based life with the best amenities of the city, and they’re not going to make it more inconvenient by allowing more people in their neighborhood – especially if it means sacrificing precious parking. But you can’t really say that at a town council meeting, can you? So instead, you begin coming up with absurd statements like the one above.
Just to be clear, an “open space” is typically a park, a “green space”, or a natural environment free from development. It’s definitely not an asphalt-covered parking lot where all non-human life has been paved away. So how do you justify calling it an open space? By saying that a mixed use development will replace “open space” (air?) with a physical structure – you know, where people actually might live:
@markvalli also posted a NIMBY flyer that decries the loss of parking, addition of traffic (even though it’s located next to a public transit line), and addition of crime. Comments on a Patch.com article say the project will turn into “public housing” eventually (i.e., more crime).
I understand that some residents in a near-transit development are going to use autos, maybe even exclusively. But clearly some percentage of their trips will be on public transit, and each one of those is one less car on the road or in a parking lot. Shouldn’t we address the needs of younger and empty-nest folks looking for residences in communities with alternative modes of transport?
Highland Park isn’t in San Diego, so why write about it here? Because the open space argument was used by a commenter on this blog a while back regarding a failed mixed-use project (also sporting some awful design) proposed for the Gala market and parking lot in South Park:
Residents love the open space of the lot and usefulness of the parking, the convenience, and the grocery store. It’s a gathering place, an open space, a hub. The community will never allow packing in 60 units, up to the curb line.
Well, we drove by that “gathering space” last Friday night at 9 PM and the only things gathered in that vast lot were a handful of cars, an attendant waving a wand for $5 parking, and a whole lot of unused, empty asphalt. Far from “hubs”, parking lots are the antithesis to a community’s walkability, and making cities walkable is arguably one of the strongest contributors to making them livable (check out this summary of Jeff Speck’s excellent Walkable City). And what’s wrong with having units up to the curb line? This presents a much more interesting walking landscape than a sea of asphalt and parked cars, for sure. I guess it’s all those balconies and windows ruining the “open space”.
Opposition to smart growth is alive and well in San Diego. This Bankers Hill resident opposes removing just one of three north and southbound lanes in his neighborhood (with several north-south alternatives) for a bike lane because of all the traffic that increased density will bring. The resident wants to see no new development, and/or parking minimums increased. Yet increasing parking only promotes the use of more cars, when we should be focused on increasing transit options in the neighborhood – which, to be fair, the resident said is insufficient. The comment was in response to downzoning uptown neighborhoods (which was mostly rejected last week, except for Mission Hills) until we find funds to increase “infrastructure” to support increased density. Infrastructure can mean a lot of things, so I’ll dodge that one before this post goes on forever.
If we can’t increase density in Bankers Hill, smack dab between downtown and Hillcrest, where do we put future growth? NIMBYs don’t have an answer for that question, and frankly don’t care. So it’s not going to be easy to move forward with smart growth, but I hope the desire of younger folks to reduce our dependence on autos eventually wins out. Unfortunately, I think we have to give up on ever convincing many older folks who have lived an auto-based lifestyle and can’t comprehend that more people in their community might not always mean more cars.
- While we’re on the subject of parking lots, it was funny to see bayfront San Diego make the Streetsblog Parking Madness contest for worst parking lot expanse in a US city’s downtown, because many of the lots cited are currently being removed for the County Admin Waterfront Park or the North Embarcadero makeover. I biked by the former a few weeks back and took this picture of progress on Phase 1, where the 250-space underground parking garage is being built on the south side of the property:
Looks like the underground parking on the will only be one floor – due to water table issues? Regardless, it was encouraging to be able to report progress on this one.

While the Gala foods parking lot isn’t beloved by me, it is getting some use. The fish taco truck is hopping (with seating to boot), there’s a flower stand, and now Captain Kirk’s coffee, which seems to be a semi-permanent structure with seating. There was a cupcake truck parked there for a while. Oh, and a bustling recycling business! It is getting more use than just parking.
April 10th, 2013 at 5:13 pm
Good to hear that, thanks Gab. It would be neat if the sidewalk-facing part of the lot could be a row of food carts like in Portland (or food trucks), with seating next to/behind it? That would improve the pedestrian experience.
April 13th, 2013 at 4:18 pm
Excellent post Paul. NIMBY’s will use every scare tactic in the book … traffic, congestion, crime, homeless, parking, etc. Of course, studies prove that the fear mongering has no basis in fact or reality. Thanks for pointing this out.
This post is from guest blogger David Lupica, who owns and writes for 365sandiego.com, and the fan page “365 things to do in San Diego” with 42,000 fans. Thanks David!
Adams Avenue is the safer, trendier, El Cajon Boulevard. Or maybe El Cajon Boulevard is the maniacal, gonzo, acid-frenzy induced, insane Adams Avenue. Either way, they’re both quite an adventure. Every San Diegan needs to take a few days off per year to stop in and investigate the ins and outs of these “yellow brick roads,” each leading to their own interpretation of “Oz.”
Take the red pill. See how far the rabbit hole goes. It’s not a question of which is better or worse, but what mood you’re in, and whether your boss will understand why you missed work on Monday, or why you’re quoting Hemingway in the stairwell on your lunch break.
Adams will lead you from University Heights, along the canyon through a million cute little antique shops, into Kensington, and finally Normal Heights. Coffee shops, pubs, book stores adorn the street, and I must say, I ALWAYS have a great time, and meet super laid back, fun, conversational people along this path. If I could put Normal Heights on the beach, I’d build a fortress around it and defend her to the death. But I guess it wouldn’t be Normal Heights. It’s one of those towns you know you could live your whole life in and be totally satisfied, if you were ready to embrace satisfaction. For me personally, I’m only ready to visit for the weekend.
Formerly known as the Roots Festival, “Adams Avenue Unplugged” is happening again on Saturday and Sunday, April 27th & 28th, 2013. This event is one of the hugest live music festivals in San Diego, and it’s free to the public. Most of the artists are acoustic based, and the genres range from jazz to bluegrass to blues and everything in between. Here’s a link to the line-up so far:
Come see some local live music from over 180 different musicians and enjoy the tasty food from hundreds of local vendors, and meet some really cool people. There’s always a really cool poster for this event too. It’d make a great full body tattoo. Does anybody know the designer? Ok I’ll see you guys there. It’s basically the ENTIRE street so you can’t miss it.

Angela Garner, Lesley Ninnes and Jo Hamilton Jones present examples of recent work in a colourful and lively exhibition which opens on Sunday 31 July and runs until Saturday 6 August, 2011, at St Ives Arts Club, Wescotts Quay.
Angela Garner, who moved to Cornwall in 1998 from Surrey, says. “My paintings are about depth and colour for the viewer to meditate upon. The viewer is invited to look into the layers of colour in my painting to the beyond to enable the mind to relax. I am currently studying for a Fine Art Degree at Camborne College and am also a member of St Ives Arts Club.”
St Ives painter, Lesley Ninnes is a long time member of Art Space Gallery co-op. “Living here brings an awareness of the elements, the movement and moods of the sea and challenging weather conditions – wild and exciting nature up close – a never ending source of inspiration.” Her artworks have twice been selected for exhibition in the annual ‘21st Century Watercolour’ competition at Bankside Gallery, London. She has shown at Bristol Affordable Art Fair, Edinburgh Art Fair, The Northern Art Show and recently, at Bath Society of Arts Annual Open Exhibition. Lesley is a member of St Ives Society of Artists and St Ives Arts Club, and an associate member of Penwith Society of Arts.
Jo Hamilton-Jones moved to Cornwall in 2004. She has recently graduated from Camborne College with a Foundation Degree in Fine Art Practice and has just accepted a place at Falmouth University on the BA Fine Art Degree course. Jo describes her current work as being concerned with ‘the visible and the invisible’. “I state what my artwork is, in the form of chemical compositions and pigments. I layer the words into the paintings leaving them hidden but still visible in certain light and from certain angles so that the viewer may find them if they wish. I also aim to please the viewer in an aesthetic manner by presenting colour that may be seen to be beautiful in its own right. I work intuitively, with materials that please me, such as oil paint, resin and acetate.”
Open daily from 10.30 am – 5 pm, the show includes original paintings, sculpture, contemporary jewellery, prints and cards – and admission is free.
It would be really great to be able to pop in - hope it goes well.
And it would be great to see you Jill! Thanks for visiting. x
I liked that blue swirl by Jo Hamilton, at first, but then it began to look like a sinister tunnel, and I didn't like it any more, and yet I did!
Says more about me than the picture, I think!!
Maybe Gilly, he he - thanks for commenting anyway though. Have a good week. Lesley x
Amazing colours on all these three pieces of work.... wishing you all every success!
Thanks Cathy - everything was looking good at the preview. x
I can see you are still busy with your lovely sea paintings. The beach were you were surfing looked gorgeous. Hope you are enjoying summer.
Always nice to find your comments, thank you.

Hi Milly - thank you. Lesley x
"Blue Swirl" resembles a Star Trek wormhole, I like it though.

Touring that could replace Willie Mays. He was just one player in our generation that nobody could replace.”
-Ken Henderson, as told to Mike Mandel for SF GIANTS An Oral History (1979)
Itâ€™s safe to say Ken Henderson is having a different experience as a rookie in San Francisco this time around.
Once the anointed successor to Mays, Henderson rejoined the Giants in March as a sales manager. It had been almost 40 years since he left San Francisco, departing in a 1972 trade to the Chicago White Sox. Now, the man who patrolled the same outfield as Mays and Bobby Bonds sells luxury box suites for AT&T Park, hawking tickets to many of the same clients heâ€™s worked with in 30 years of sales and marketing since his playing career ended. He said itâ€™s good to be back working for the Giants.
â€œI feel a lot of emotion coming back to the organization that really gave me my first shot at professional baseball,â€ said Henderson, 64, who’s married with four children and five grandchildren. â€œHad it not been for the Giants, Iâ€™m not sure that I would have had the success that I had. Just as importantly, my two brothers played for the Giants organization, I had a son that played in the Giants organization, I had a father who scouted for the Giants organization for awhile. So, this may sound unusual, but I feel all this has given me an opportunity to give back to the organization what they gave to our family.â€
Signed out of high school in 1964, Henderson came up the following spring when Mays turned 34 and was thought to be slowing down, which led to the comparisons in the media between the two players. But Mays proceeded to hit 52 home runs in 1965 and win National League Most Valuable Player honors while Henderson spent most of the season as a backup. For the next three years, Henderson alternated between the Giants bench and Triple-A, while Mays continued to make All Star appearances, win Gold Glove awards and garner MVP votes.
Henderson finally stuck with San Francisco in 1969 and was a Giant regular the next few years. He had perhaps his best season in 1970 when he hit 17 home runs, with 88 runs batted in and a .294 batting average. Henderson said he, Bonds and Mays might have comprised the best outfield in baseball with their ability to close gaps. â€œYou werenâ€™t going to hit a ball past us,â€ Henderson said.
He said as much to Mandel, noting of his 1970 season in SF GIANTS, â€œThatâ€™s when Willie didnâ€™t feel me as a threat anymore. I think that once he saw that they werenâ€™t going to push him out of centerfield, that I was going to play left and Bonds was going to play right, I sensed that he really started to open up to everybody. And thatâ€™s when I felt that I made the most progress in learning from him.â€
Henderson reiterated to me that the Mays comparisons were unfair. But he also said Mays was the best player he ever saw and a great clubhouse presence. Neither man was long for San Francisco beyond their 1971 playoff team. The following spring, Mays was dealt to the New York Mets and six months later, the Giants packaged Henderson with Steve Stone in a trade for a two-time 15-game winner named Tom Bradley. The trade came not long after Henderson was named MLB Player of the Month for August 1972, when he hit .440.
Men like Garry Maddox, Gary Matthews, and others got their futile shots at assuming Maysâ€™ spot in the San Francisco outfield, while Henderson became a journeyman, playing for seven teams in all. He finished 19th in MVP voting in 1974, when he hit .292 with a career-high 20 home runs for the White Sox. But his last few seasons were like his first, mostly confined to various benches. He retired in 1980 at 33 with 1,168 hits, 122 home runs and a .257 lifetime batting average in 16 seasons.
â€œI donâ€™t lose much sleep over it but I think about it from time to time, you know, could I have played longer,â€ Henderson said.
For some players, baseball is all they ever know. Not Henderson, who’s built a life away from the game, working many years in the private sector. He sold office furniture for a stretch and more recently was an executive for Staples.
He wishes heâ€™d kept closer ties with Bobby Bonds, who died of cancer in 2003. Henderson said he still carries a Bobby Bonds baseball card with him, and he has stories about a young Barry Bonds in the Giants clubhouse (â€œBarry never lacked for confidence,â€ Henderson told me.) But he drifted from Bobby Bonds after their playing days, even as Bonds lived just south of San Francisco in San Carlos, less than an hour from Henderson in Los Gatos.
â€œI wish Iâ€™d spent more time and gotten to know him better before he died,â€ Henderson said.
Hendersonâ€™s done a better job keeping up with former Giants like Vida Blue, Jim Davenport, and Mike McCormick. And on Thursday evening, heâ€™ll be assisting Mays, serving as one of the hosts for the Giants immortal at a corporate event at AT&T Park.
â€œIâ€™m very much looking forward to it,â€ Henderson said. â€œI know that his eyesight is not that good anymore, so heâ€™ll need some help, and Iâ€™m glad to be there for him. Very special night.â€
Graham Womack writes the blog, Baseball: Past and Present
A great story! Back in the day, Kenny Henderson was my favorite White Sox player. I’m recalling a 1974 White Sox home game (vs. Detroit). It was the bottom of the 9th inning, and Kenny hit the game-winning home run! Kenny, Dick Allen and Bill Melton were the heavy hitters on that 1974 White Sox team. Sadly, the 1974 White Sox finished nine games out of first place in the AL West. Oakland won the AL West, and the World Series.

Firstly, let's get this straight.
No party, my own included, has the right to criticize David Laws for expenses. Between Duck Houses, Moats and Bath Plugs and Porn all 3 of the major Westminster parties have put themselves to shame on expenses. Countless times.
Before any of the smaller parties think they can muscle in on this - European Expenses haven't been much better, frankly. I'm looking at you, Nigel Farage.
So let's get off our high horses of partisan bias for a second and have a look at what this actually is.
David Laws, firstly, could actually have claimed a whole heap more legitimately if he'd declared his partnership. He didn't. He could also have claimed a whole heap more if he'd decided to live in a nice plush flat in central London. He didn't. To be honest, finding accommodation at the price he did is a bargain. Trust me - I live here.
The next interesting thing in this case is that people seem to find it outrageous that his landlord was also his partner. I'm sorry, but so the fuck what!? Whether I love a guy or not, he's still got a business to run, and thus I should be paying my rent regardless. There's this ridiculous assumption that because they were gay they must have moved in together and loved it all up and settled down watching Graham Norton every night on the sofa. Er, welcome to 2010 - that is not how "the gays" live. It's perfectly acceptable for somebody to be living with a partner without having joint ownership or paying joint rent.
Laws was paying for goods and services rendered. I.e. a place to live.
This is perfectly fine under parliamentary rules. His relationship with the Landlord, frankly, should have nothing to do with it.
So let's put this in simple terms for those of you who're still not understanding:
David Laws rents a room and pays his landlord as he should.
David Laws and his landlord have a warm tingly fuzzy feeling for each other, and so they make themselves an item.
David Laws and his landlord do not buy a new house together, but they decide effectively to share the rent. So David pays his share to his landlord, who also pays his own share... to himself.
Still following? Good. It's not a difficult concept.
Laws' landlord now moves to a different place. Laws continues to pay his share, but now, seeing as he's the only one living there, he pays the whole amount (to his landlord, yes, that's right).
Mr Laws probably realised at some point that there might be some questions raised at this perfectly legitimate arrangement and thus changed the arrangement in good faith so that he was no longer paying his landlord rent which he was perfectly entitled to do.
The hype here is not the money as such. It's the fact that his landlord was his partner.
Perhaps it's time for some people to catch up with the world. There's nothing wrong with that.
They didn't have a shared bank account or any such arrangement, so it's not like Laws and his partner were living it up on parliamentary expenses. Anyone who's not done their research and is instead getting fuelled up on the anti-Laws hype, frankly needs gagging.
So, as a relatively sane person, able to put aside my own party bias for the 30 seconds needed to assess the situation, I won't be calling for David Laws' head. Neither should you, frankly.
What's more, I'd like to see somebody trying to justify the need to put a moat on expenses.
Sadly, all of this media hype has caused David to come out in a way that I'd assume isn't terribly dignified. He clearly felt he was unable to be openly gay here, and that is something we should all be ashamed of.
Should he be resigning? I think not.

Well, I have been convinced out of my apathy.
My take on this was from a slightly different angle (), but you also make a very good point about the restrictive definition of "partner" that institutions tend to use these days. Just because I'm sleeping with someone (or even I love someone) does not mean I have/wish to have joint finances with them.

This document specifies using HTTP/HTTPS as the transport layer for Riap, or Riap::HTTP for short.
Riap over HTTP also allows a mechanism to pass logging messages during function calls by using HTTP chunked response.
Two additional Riap request keys are recognized for this:
An integer number with value either 0 (for none, the default), 1 (for sending fatal messages), 2 (error), 3 (warn), 4 (info), 5 (debug), and 6 (trace). When a value larger than 0 specified, server must return chunked HTTP response and each log message should be sent as a separate chunk, and the result as the last chunk.
A bool, default to 0. When set to true, server will prepend each log message with "L" (and the result with "R"). Only useful/relevant when turning on loglevel, so clients can parse/separate log message from result.

I have flown many Magnum engines. And I have yet to have a problem with any of them. Hobby people had a sale on the magnum 91 4 stroke. It was priced so low I bought one without even having a model to put it on. I just know someday I will. The 1 OS motor I owned seemed to never idle correctly. So 3-4 years of flying and I can recommend Magnum with no problem.

RE: Monokote....Never Again
[quote]ORIGINAL: ratshooter You know Mike all I did was post what I did to get a better covering job and you seemed to be offended by my extra effort to get a good covering job. If you don't like monokote then don't use it. I admit after a 10 year period away from the hobby I hadn't noticed it's not called "Super Monokote" anymore. This is the third plane I have built in the year and a half since I have been back. The first plane did have a small wrinkle problem. I figured it was my fault for being in a hurry to get a flying plane. The second plane turned out much better because I spent a little more time making sure it was dust free. On the third and last plane I made a real effort to make sure I had a clean, smooth airframe to cover. Plus I made sure that I wasn't relying on the shrinkage to correct for my not getting it semi tight to start with. Sorry if spending a little time to make sure you are covering a clean piece of wood is offensive to you. But that is what I will do in the future. I came here to post something positive for the OP in the hopes that he might read what I wrote and see if maybe part of his problem with MK might be his own doing. That was all. I think you may be on to something. I believe it is possible that I did not clean the area of dust well enough. That makes sense to me based on what I remember about the day I covered the Stinger. I think I will try a test piece sanded smooth and then cleaned off with compressed air instead of just a dust cloth. Thanks for the positive response and idea.

RE: Monokote....Never Again
[quote]ORIGINAL: Top_Gunn [quote]I don't doubt some rolls can be defective as any product can be. However I do think technique is the difference between excellent results and failure. [/quote] If you believe this then you have to believe that a lot of people once knew how to use Monokote and then forgot, and others remember on some planes but forget on others. I'm not a Monokote basher: I like it and use it sometimes. But there are real problems with many of their rolls. The complaints are real and legitimate, not whining from people who don't know what they are doing. I agree that the problem is quality control, but it's not just "as any product can be." For years, getting a bad roll of Monokote was rare, just as getting a bad roll of other films is rare today. Now, a lot of people are having problems. We ought to be able to discuss this without saying that people whose experiences don't match ours are incompetent. The fact that some people haven't had problems doesn't mean that the people who do are fools. [/quote] I couldnt agree more. Very well said.

RE: Monokote....Never Again
I cant remember the last time I saw so many sensitive people. I was under the assumption ( and yes I know what that means) that this was a forum for discussing our experianc, both good and bad, in differant areas of this hobby. The title to the thread seems to be pretty obvious about the content. So if you personally have read all you want to have read on the subject feel free to bypass the thread. Yes. I have read many comments about Monokote over the last few years. But I havent used it in many years myself and since it was the only brand available at my LHS I thought I would see for myself how it works. But I guess I was just being lazy when I used it or I would have been able to make it shrink more. I marvel at the skill of some builders and their ability to use a product I cannot. But the next time I think I have something to say I am not going to see if someonce had already said it before. Once again I am going to assume something. I assume that everyone who is visiting this site has not read everything that has ever been posted. In my mind if you have read something here so many times it irritrates you to see it again than mabe you spend far to much time on the internet. So once again, if the thread title is something you are not interested in, just dont read it.

RE: Building Is Great !!!!
I have a 98in wingspan Giles 202 that I have built the fuse and tail feathers on. It is going to have an 80cc gas engine so it is by far the most expensive kit I will have built. A model that size requires expensive radio gear as well. That being said, I just finshed a lanier Stinger 60. And by just finished I mean that I declared it airworthy just 2 days ago. The magnum 61 has had 2 tanks run throught it so I have not yet maidened the Stinger. Hopefully this Sunday the weather will cooperate. On the same evening that I essentially finished the Stinger I cleaned up my shop and then pulled down the Chaos 60 from the shelf and started on it. Got the plans taped to the wall, and built the vert and horz stab. I also have another kit in the box in line for when the Chaos will be finished. I have it bad. I am semi retired and only work at my wifes store about 2-3 days a week.. So I have plenty of time. And I spend a great deal of that time in my shop. So many of my club buddies can build but due to the constraints of daily life just dont have the time and as such there are alot of ARFS at our field. They all like to see what I will show up with next. Watching your new bird fly straight and level is a good feeling. I must agree that building your own adds a whole new dimension to the hobby and I think all fliers should try to build a kit at least once. I also agree that smaller is not easier. There are alot of kits out there designed for the new builder. I would also suggest the Balsa USA trainer. Check out their website. They have more than just bipes. And the Giles 202 will probably be finished later this year. Have a kit you wannae sell? PM me and lets talk!!!

Monokote....Never Again
I used the Top Flight Monokote yesterday for the first time in many years. I have been either fiberglassing or using Ultracoat. I do not usually brand bash because I believe that a product might just be fine for someone other than me. So to each his own. But the Monokote I used (new from the hobby shop) was horrible. It had no stretch to it at all. And it just doesnt shrink anywhere near as much as Ultracoat will. I used it to cover the fuse and tail feathers on a Stinger 60. I just cannot believe how many wrinkles there are. It looks like a total beginner job. I am no expert at covering but jeez. I havent been this bad in a long time.

ZDZ 80 B2
I bought an old ZDZ 80 B2 at Perry this year. It came from an estate sale and the guys couldnt tell me anything about the motor. It has a 24X10 Stinger prop and turning it over by hand it seems to have solid compression. The muffler needs replacing. I just tried for the last 30 minutes to upload some pics of the carb, but no joy there. It is a Walbro. My club prez is a very experianced gasser, but he has no ZDZ experiance. I on the other hand have zero experiance with all gassers and this will be my first. This thing will be going on a 98 in wingspan Lanier Giles 202. I have read alot and I believe that this motor is plenty of power for my needs. Any info you guys could give us about this motor would be appreciated. It came with no manuals. I have a test stand and I am hoping to try ti fire it up in the next 2 -3 weeks.

Lanier Stinger 60 - 90
I bought a partially assembleb Lanier Stinger at a swap meet. The fuse and tail feathers are all assmbled and I have almost finished with the foam core wing. I was wondering if anyone out there has the instructions for putting together the plastic parts. The entire top portion from tail to nose is 3 or 4 pieces of plastic. This thing did not come with the instructions and it is not obvious from the plans how to attach the various pieces. It looks like the tail/turtle deck would be glued. Then there is the wing hatch. And forward of that there is the tank cover and then the cowl. The wing hatch has to be removable. But I wonder if the tank cover is also supposed to be removable. Any help would be greatlt appreciated.

I was blown away by how many sellers there were. And then I found out I was only in the first building! 3 large buildings of everything rc was so cool. I managed to only spend 600 bucks. But I actually got everything on my wish list. Including an 80 cc gasser. It is used and came from an estate sale so I do not know how well it works. But hey, it was only 250 bucks. I also got a float plane that is 180 at Tower and I paid 100 NIB. And another foamie BD5 for 30 bucks. AND an RDS 8000 for only 30 bucks. I feel like I made out very well.

No Representation
I went to the Perry Ga swap meet last weekend. It was my first time there. I was blown away at how many people were there and the vast array of RC product from both individuals and hobby stores. What I was very disappointed in was the total lack of Airtronics radio products there. Futaba amd others were everywhere. I am the only guy in my club who flies with Airtronics. It was pretty much impossible to get any of the guys to even consider Airtronics. There was 1 RDS8000 there and I bought it for a buddy box for my own RDS 8000. I paid 30 bucks. The guy who sold it to me had bought the 10 channel radio and didnt need the 8 ch any more. Good for me. I have heard that Airtronics is much bigger on the west coast. I just wish they were represented better out here.

I think the 5 ch Airtronics is about 50 bucks cheaper than the 6. It will probably be a loooong time before you need that extra channel. I am talking years.

RE: I guess I'm getting better
Here is my problem. I have just in the last week got my confidence back. I have not had alot of oprtunity to actually fly this season for various reasons. Mostly wind. But now that I have no issues taking off, flying with loops rolls and even snap rolls, and landing, the season will be over soon. Here in North Alabama you just never know what winter will be like. The last 2 have been abnormally cold. So if it is 3 months or so between flights I lose my confidence all over again. And it doesnt help to hear guys at the club talking about knees shaking. You know, the real experts.

RE: magnum 46 vs. OS 46
I had an OS 65LA and was not impressed. It was very hard to start. I ran it for 2 years and I could never get it right. I have since flown 4 magnums and they all start very easy and run and run and run. I do give everything I run a very good breakin on the bench before flight. Maybe thats the secret.

Return to Caribbean Series possible for Cuba
Country last participated in 1960; door open for 2013 event
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -- More than fifty years after the country's last appearance in the Caribbean Series, Cuba could return to the Caribbean Confederation and participate in next year's event in Mexico.
On Thursday, Caribbean Confederation commissioner Juan Francisco Puello said he is leading a delegation to Cuba next month to present a proposal to the island's sports authorities in an effort to bring them back to the series.
"We are thinking about including Cuba in some way," Puello said. "We believe they will be a big factor in the next Caribbean Series in Hermosillo [Mexico]."
An original member of the Caribbean Confederation, along with Panama, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, Cuba played host to the first Caribbean Series in 1949, one year after the federation was formed.
From 1949 to 1960, Cuba won the title seven times. In '59, Fidel Castro took over in Cuba and declared it a Communist nation, ending its participation in the Caribbean Series after '60."It will depend on them," Puello said. "In regards to Cuba, people are mistaken. We never shut the door. It was them who didn't want to come for various reasons. Now, we are working on a proposal in this case to see if we can get them excited about returning to the Caribbean Series."
Puello added that Panama, Nicaragua and Colombia will not join the Caribbean Federation in the near future, because the leagues have struggled economically and could not host a Caribbean Series any time soon.
"In regards to those leagues, if you can't take care of your own house, you can't take on another," he said. "Nicaragua, Colombia and Panama have economic problems internally. Solve your problems internally. If those leagues are functioning well economically, we will open the doors to the Confederation."

Op-ed: Our political system rejects statesmanship and solutions
Guest columnist James Windle writes that after running unsuccessfully for Congress, he believes the parties prefer partisan gridlock and the blame game.
Special to The Times
I just finished an unsuccessful first run for the 8th Congressional District seat as an independent in Washington state. Having spent the past decade working in the federal government in Washington, D.C., I believed I could be more effective in advocating solutions as a centrist independent than adding to the partisan gridlock as a moderate Democrat or Republican.
After my experience, I have concluded that the era of statesmanship and solutions is over.
Politics is about winning elections. The path of least resistance is to focus voters on partisan messages and fear. The people who are sick of this brand of politics stay home and do not vote. The political-party base gets charged up by the passion of the fight and, in the final weeks of a campaign, an effort is made to pull in independents likely to vote. If this is the formula for victory, why go through the trouble of searching for a statesman or stateswoman with experience, independent ideas and courage to work with others on solutions? It actually creates liabilities for a campaign.
Evidence can be found in the current Congress. At first glance, 10 percent approval ratings of Congress would suggest that the parties and members would want to get work done. The Pelosi 111th Congress (2008-2010) offered solutions with an economic-stimulus package and health-care reform. Democrats lost the majority in the House. The better strategy is to go home with nothing done and play the blame game. That is what the current 112th Congress did.
At the heart of the blame game is the belief that the opposing party wishes to destroy America. This sounds melodramatic, but when you have worked closely with both parties, as I have, it is what the faithful believe. The Republicans want anarchy and hate puppies; the Democrats would turn us into China and jail rich people. This simplification would be funny if the stakes were not so high with too many Americans struggling in the economy.
A little over a decade ago, solutions could be found. The parties and public had sharply differing views complete with scandals and impeachment. Yet, the machinery of government continued to get work done. For example, the Democratic Clinton administration balanced the federal budget, building on a Republican president's tax increase in 1992 while working with a fiery Republican majority in the House of Representatives from 1994 to 2000. My, how politics has changed.
The mass media and campaign finance are two factors explaining the shift in American politics and elections. Voters are inundated with an unprecedented volume of information in traditional and new media. The information anarchy leads voters to seek media outlets that collate and filter information. The media outlets become magnets for campaigns that know the profiles of voters they can reach. The campaigns launch messaging offensives to invoke fear.
The increasing amount of money in elections provides the fuel for media offensives. The total expenditures on campaigns for Congress increased from $781 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2010, according to the Committee for Economic Development. The Super PACs, resulting from the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the total. The current presidential race has already spent more than the record-setting 2008 race.
In the final analysis, parties and candidates do what is necessary to win within an election system that by most accounts is broken. The parties' desire to control Congress and the White House, the status of the media and campaign finance mean solutions are no longer necessary to win elections. This is the sad state of American politics.

Weddings FAQ's. Whatever style of wedding celebration you choose, our friendly and capable staff will organise every detail so you can relax and enjoy your special day.
Typical concerns people have about their wedding?
One of the main concerns all wedding couples have is can they have the wedding day they want on the budget they have allocated. Most bride and grooms come along with a clear view on what they want, we always try and work with them to achieve this, but it can sometimes mean comprising in places to work within their budget.
What kind of weddings can you organise?
Within reason anything really!. We also have the facility to have a large marquee on the back of the Lakeside Suite. Smaller intimate gatherings for close family and friends can also be accommodated.
We cater only for one wedding reception a day at the hotel, which means we give every bridal party a personalised and attentive service. A good venue should provide a service equal to that of a personal wedding planner. At Seckford Hall we pride ourselves on offering a complete service to our bride and grooms.
Each reception is different and the seating arrangements, choice of food and music will vary according to a couple’s individual preference. We have had bbq’s and hog roasts in the past and even had a medieval wedding, where the groom arrived in a suit of armour! We have also had couples wanting to surprise their guests with their choice of menu. One particular couple that were great connoisseurs of food had sausage and mash followed by Angel Delight! That really took everyone by surprise!
What are the most popular?
We find because Seckford Hall is in such a romantic setting that the traditional type of wedding is still hugely popular. A traditional sit down meal with speeches and an evening reception. We cater for civil ceremonies too, which are also becoming more popular, bride and grooms like the idea of having the wedding all in one location.
What are your main tips/advice, things that couples should definitely consider?
We think it is really important to plan the day you want, not what somebody else wants! Bride and Grooms often feel pressure from family members; it is your day, and important to remember this.
What questions should you ask?
We will always go through the whole day with the bride and groom, however if you are planning anything unusual it is best to ask questions in advance not the week before the wedding. For example booking a ten-piece band and then finding out there is not enough space in the room!
How long does it take to plan a wedding?
We have anything from 3 months to two years! On the whole most people tend to book up a good year to 18 months in advance. This is advisable as we find the top photographers; florists and other suppliers tend to be booked up very much in advance too.
Can you accommodate all size of wedding?
We can accommodate up 120 in our Lakeside Suite, 140 with a marquee. We can also cater for smaller intimate weddings in our Lakeside Suite or in the main hotel restaurant.
How much should couples be prepared to spend?
We are always happy to work within the bride and grooms budget. The cost will ultimately depend on the type of wedding required. If the budget set aside is really not going to get you the wedding you want, we always recommend that the couple look at ways of making savings. For example, getting married mid-week or out of season can save quite a lot of money. Suppliers also tend to reduce their rates at these times, so it is still possible to achieve the day you had planned.
Tell us about your background?
Seckford Hall has been organising weddings for generations. Mr Bunn who owns the hotel has alone arranged weddings for over 40 years. What is really interesting is that we are now organising the wedding receptions of the children whose parents got married at our hotel too.

Now For Something Silly
1.10.2013
Time to break-up the crazy seriousness that's been going on in these parts lately. I feel like every post has been an expose on intense life happenings. Sorry about that. Today I thought I'd share a few silly facts about me that go against everything blog land (and Pinterest too).
1. I hate red velvet everything. As a kid I got sick after eating red velvet cake, and now every time I see it I want to gag.
2. I've never tried any kind of nail art ever, and probably never will. I hate painting my nails, but my toe nails are another story.
3. I didn't really wear make-up until I started blogging. I can admit being peer pressured into something.
4. I've never eaten a macaroon, and I'm not really tempted to try them now.
5. I don't like cupcakes.
6. I haven't been thrifting in two months, and it's killing me!
7. I'm not a fan of the mixed drink. I have found a total of two I like: "bourbon and ginger," and one we made up w/no name. I'd rather drink beer instead.
8. I'm a terrible gardener, and kill almost every plant I touch.
9. I think newborn babies are ugly.
Of course all of these things are my personal opinions and tastes, and I think it's great if you like all of the above. As a matter of fact I think you're probably way cooler than I am. I'm just not cool you guys, it's a lifelong deficiency of mine. big kiss, bekuh
- ► 2012 (367)
the biggest reason why i like red velvet is for the cream cheese icing and i like cream cheese everythingggg haha
I am with you on about half of these, but I love red velvet. Love, love, love it. Nail art is boring, I rarely wore lipstick until I started blogging, macaroons are dry, beer is my go-to drink, plants shrivel up at the mere sight of me, and babies don't even start getting cute until they are at least six months old.
I hadn't tried a macaroon before I went to Paris and the ones we had there were kind of amazing! I wish I had a green thumb, but plants don't seem very fond of me.
i'm definitely with ya on picking beer over mixed drinks.
GOOD beer that is ;)
xo the egg out west.
This post cracked me up. Good job keeping it real! I'm right there with you on the mixed drinks thing. Beer all the way! xo
i agree with all of these i swear.
i hate red velvet, i seriously think its so gross. ew.
i hate makeup, im good with mascara and a little powder, but i think its overrated. lol
i've never eaten a macaroon either, i think they look gross...
my husband and i got a succulent and it died within a week, we seriously killed a succulent.
and i was just telling my husband how ugly newborns are. they all look the same i never quite got why people put up a million pictures of their babies that are fresh out of the womb. but really.
K
Haha, I'm a terrible gardener too. I have one plant that I've had for a few years and it's the only plant that's ever survived with me. I love painting my nails, but it's so frustrating that they chip so quickly, so I usually just do my toenails.
haha - You think newborns are ugly... Definitely made me laugh, but it may get you in trouble one day. - Thanks for the quirky post.
- tianna :)
Hahaha! This made me laugh so much! 1--red velvet isn't all that good anyway. 3--my love of wearing makeup made me want to start blogging! 4--I've never eaten a macaroon, either, but I got my mom a macaroon cookbook for Christmas so maybe I will soon ;) 8--plants die voluntarily around me. They don't even try to live! Hahaha! 9--I sort of think so too, but I'm sure that'll change once I have one of my own :)
Have a lovely day!
SaraM
Thanks for the laugh today Bekuh, needed it! :)
I also kill all my plants! and as for newborn babies... don't they look a little like aliens?
Most of them are great except the last.. That's just sad :( I totally agree babies get cuter when they chub out but every baby is cute when they are born. And macaroons are just nasty :(
I call newborn babies slugs. I'm not a fan.
And, I also hate nail polish of any kind and just can't be bothered to put it on my fingers or toes. Not for me.
Now, despite our similarities, there is one thing I love on that list: red velvet cake. It's my FAVE! Ian even made one from scratch for my b-day last year. So good.
Oh my gosh, this list is TOO GOOD!! I am the worst at painting my nails and can't even think about nail art (plus i think it looks weird.)
And i'm not a huge fan of red velvet either! It's too rich. and i think it's weird to eat cake thats red. Doesn't work for me.
Well, this really made me laugh! Simple and to-the-point! :)
HAHA I can relate to most of these. You should do these more often, this made my morning :-)
Sabrina
babies are the worst! wait, no— red velvet is the worst! ahhh, it's a pretty tough decision to make but it's nice to see someone else on my team ;-)
i also think newborns are ugly haha love this post!
I have never seen the appeal of red velvet anything, the colour just looks so unnatural I can't bring myself to try it! Actually, I could relate to quite a lot of these, thanks for the laugh xo
I can resonate with so many of these! I hate painting my nails, I'm not a fan of cupcakes and I don't like the look of newborn babies!
Becky
xx
Oh gosh, I am right there with you girl! I kill every plant I touch, I don't know how! So sad, ha
xo TJ
I don't get why red velvet cake is so popular. If it's just because it is an appropriate vehicle for cream cheese frosting, I can get behind that- but otherwise, isn't it just regular cake, dyed red? Eww?
lol this made me laugh because as much as i wish i liked painting my nails i dislike it very much and feel so much nicer with bare & clean fingernails! also what's with the obsession with macaroons? i don't get it!!! is there some magical substance inside of those little pastries... they look like tiny oreos to me haha! i've never tried them either and most likely never will! wish you a wonderful week :)
I'm with you on everything 'cept the macaroons. I was also reticent to try them given how trendy they've become, but I tried one at a party over the holidys & they really are lovely. Go ahead & try-- no one will tell~*
hah, love this cute little post. :] I'm so with you on 2/8/9 and I used to be on board with #4...until I had one in Paris. That sort of changes things. :]
I've never had a macaroon either. I'm a little tempted but not enough to actually make them.
This comment has been removed by the author.
hahaha this list is great. as a huge baker i feel like its a terrible secret that i've yet to have a macaroon either! and my boyfriend agrees with your baby sentiment...he says "every baby looks just like every other baby ever"
I have never eaten a macaroon and I don't do nail art either. We actually have a lot of those things in common! Who knew!
Chao
Poppie
I totally understand almost everything on this list! I literally cannot wear nail varnish for longer than 24 hours - it feels like my nails can't breathe, haha!
Haha! I agree with you on quite a few of these. I hate red velvet, don't do nail art, can't keep a single plant alive (I recently killed a succulent), etc.
Have a great weekend!
I had a similar bad experience with Chicken McNuggets when I was a kid... can't eat them ever since. I'm also not very creative with painting my nails. I never paint my fingers because I have a horrible habit of chipping it off, but my toes are almost always painted.
haha, newborn babies are ugly!
i'm completely with you on 7 & 9.
Haha I haven't really ever had anything red velvet. There is something about it that kind of looks gross to me and I really have no desire to try.
I'm pretty much with you on the nails. I like pretty nails but really don't enjoy painting my finernails that much. If I do, it is usually with a classic red or otherwise they are clear and plain. but my toenails are ALWAYS painted. It feels wrong if they are not.
Anyway yay for random posts - they are some of my favorite kinds!

What to wear after breast augmentation? Breast implants bring a lot of changes to a woman. Of course, the obvious change is physical, which can improve confidence, and can also alter your social life in different ways. However, there are some other changes you normally ignore like the way to dress, because after the surgery you may require appropriate clothing, comfortable and of course clothing that enhances the change that your body has acquired.
<|endofexample|>
Why do we do this thing called the writer’s life?
• Why do we walk around asking “What if? What if? What if?”
• Why do we listen to the voices in our head instead of
medicating them into oblivion and getting a decent night’s sleep?
• Why do we participate in an annual event dubbed NaNoWriMo and fingersprint to produce 60k words during the month of November?
• Why do we spend hundreds – no, thousands of dollars attending conferences where we sweat through our super-strength deodorant during fifteen minute appointments with editors and agents?
• Why do we check our inboxes dozens of times a day just to see if “the” agent or “the” editor has responded to our proposal? (Please say yes! Please say yes!)
I know the answer: It’s because (say it with me now) we want to be successful.
But then … we achieve success. Oh, happy day!
And thus commences a whole new round of whys.
• Why do we blog and speak at writers groups and pursue the next contract … and the next?
• Why do we invest hundreds – no, thousands of dollars updating our websites and printing bookmarks and redoing our professional photos?
• Why do we tackle the social media beast – twittering and commenting and posting – when none of the words produced matter in the word count tally of our work-in-progress (WIP)?
• Why do we gauge our achievements by someone else’s? (The writer’s version of “The grass is always greener” syndrome.)
I know the answer to these questions too: It’s because (say it with me) we want to be successful.
Funny, isn’t it? Different questions but the same answers.
Here’s what I would like to suggest today: We’re answering the question wrong.
With the debut of my inspirational contemporary romance, Wish You Were Here, I could pick up the (imaginary) stamp of success and hit myself in the forehead with it. But here’s the truth: Before the ink dried, something will happen to make me feel unsuccessful. Less than. Maybe someone doesn’t like my book. (It happens.) Or maybe someone likes my writing friends’ books better. (It happens.) Or maybe I walk into the local Barnes and Nobles and my book isn’t there. (So far, that hasn’t happened.)
As I wrestled with the whole idea of success, I realized this writing journey isn’t about me achieving certain things. Yes, I would like it to be about that – earning out my advances, receiving awards, being noticed.
Hey, I’m just being honest here. Honesty isn’t always pretty.
But God isn’t in the “It’s all about you, Beth” business. Or the “It’s all about you, __________” business. (Insert your name in the blank.)
God uses all of my experiences to conform me to his image so that I can, in turn, show the world what he is like.
The world’s definition of success is all about demanding “Hey! Notice me!”
God’s definition of success is all about embracing the scriptural command to become “less than” ( Matthew 20:26) as he provides opportunities to say, “Let me introduce you to an amazing God who has changed me in a miraculous way.”
Because I am a writer, God works through my life as I walk the writing road. In his economy – Kingdom living – it’s not about my sales stats or how many stars I’ve accumulated on Amazon. Nope. It’s about how God uses all of this to scrape off my rough edges – the doubts, the jealousy – so that I look less like me and more like him. And it’s about bringing people one step closer to Jesus. I can do that through the stories I write, yes. And I can do that through my words and my actions, day in and day out, as I live the life of an author. inspirational contemporary romance novel, Wish You Were Here, debuted May 2012 (Howard Books.) Her second novel, Catch a Falling Star, releases May 2013. Beth is an established magazine writer and former editor of Connections, the leadership magazine for MOPS International.

Wonderful perspective, Beth. Thank you so much.
Good morning, my beautiful friend!!!
You are so right, but that's not surprising.
And if you [yes you, the other youse not Beth] haven't read her book yet, you need to.
Like now.
Because it has llamas.
What more do you need? ;)
Welcome to SEEKERVILLE, BETH!!!
A fellow Coloradoan!
You post is so right on the mark.
Llamas??
Really?
AUDRA! SHE HAS LLAMAS!!!
Hello, KC, Carol (aka Beautiful!), and Tina:
Thanks for the welcome to Seekerville!
And, yes, there are llamas in Wish You Were Here -- 3 of 'em to be exact. And there's a story to why there are llamas ...
Tina, my deadline for book 2 is past. It is time we meet face to face!
:O)
Yeah, but my deadline isn't past lol.
Oh, I love this! So, so true.
When I told a friend that I signed a contract with Love Inspired, she said, ' Don't worry, I still respect you even though you wrote a romance.'
Oh, I didn't know I should have been woried I was losing respect. Didn't get that memo. *sigh*
It IS all about God and His wll for our writing life.
Thanks for the support and reminder of what success really is.
I'm laughing out loud because Grandma Eichas (a sage, sweet old German woman who loved me to pieces) always said, "Never say never. Inevitably, it will come to pass."
I think God takes our "nevers' like I take a Tina Radcliffe dare...
PLEASE NOTE: TINA DOES NOT TAKE MY DARES. NO. SHE CALMLY MOVES ON AND IGNORES ME.
This is probably why I got into more trouble in school. Sigh...
Beth, I love this! It's all so true. This is such a capricious business that we need to be prepared for anything and (literally) expect nothing.
And I'm not a pessimist, but we have to Serenity Prayer ourselves through a writing career because we only control so much. The rest, well??? We leave in the hands of professionals and God.
Oh, that God!
Hey, muffins this morning. Blueberry streusal (and NOT the ones I ruined a few weeks ago in Yankee Belle and Facebook. Sheesh...) and chocolate chip. Coffee's here, I brought the Keurig along and a host of flavors. Creamers to your left and Oh, look!!! Lacey sent along lemon cookies for us!
We love Lacey around our house!
Ooohhhh! Beth, this was excellent! I loved this line:
It’s about how God uses all of this to scrape off my rough edges – the doubts, the jealousy – so that I look less like me and more like him.
Sooooo true! You are one smart gal, you know?
Good morning! I love this post. God used it to speak to my heart. I am going to take today and see if I can't do things differently to present God and not myself. I had been praying about a way to handle some things at work, and here is the answer. Thank you so much for your insight!
Makes one wary of using the word NEVER, doesn't it?
A lovely reminder that I need to consider not just in writing but in all I do. Thank you Beth.
Hi Beth,
Wonderful post! It reminds me of one of my favorite daily prayers.
"Grant me the grace to live my life in such a way that others may recognize Jesus in me."
How about "why do we continue when our families wonder why we feel compelled to hunch our bodies over a computer and let our eyes grow big as we grind our fingers into typeworn keys?"
Just asking :-)
Beth, sending military wife hugs to you and a "thanks for your service" shout out to your hubby!
Loved your post. All so true. If I wrote for my glory I would have given up long ago. :)
Luckily God knew that so he opened the door to inspirational fiction and invited me to work with Him and for Him. Very cool how God operates when we let Him be in control. :)
How fun to read about the "nevers" in your life. God does have a sense of humor. I think He laughs at me most of the time, saying, "Deb, lighten up. I've got your back."
Mary C...lovely prayer. Thanks for sharing.
Walt, you have a dream. Dreams feed the soul and give meaning to life. Keep writing! You're so close.
Beth, I loved this posting...Looking forward to reading your novel.

Welcome to Seekerville, Beth. Thanks for the inspiring post!! You nailed the journey we're on and the pitfalls along the way that can make us stumble. The downs of this business, probably more than the ups, polish us to shine for Him.
Janet
It's time for the questions we ask all our new guests to Seekerville!
A peek inside YOUR life.
Beth, tell us about a day in your writing life.
How DID you make that first sale? What was your road to publication?
Finally, what's next?
I enjoyed your post. Great way to start the day with the right prospective. It's all for Him.
Llamas? I love llamas! And alpacas, but that's a whole 'nother story, LOL!
Welcome to Seekerville, Beth! A fellow Coloradoan? I love it. There can never be too many of us : )
I love your words of encouragement, too. Isn't it just too depressing when we focus on ourselves and realize how far short we fall of perfection?
Glad God is always there to smack us upside of the head when we begin to wallow. Trust me, I've got the bruises to show for it : )
Congrats on your debut! Enjoy the rush!!
Oh, BETH HONEY, PREACH IT!!!! I've been singing this song for four years now and I STILL can't carry a tune. :(
Beautifully and honestly spoken, my friend. Now I suggest each one of us do what I'm gonna do -- print this baby off and hang it up, because darlin', I ain't NEVER butted heads with anything harder in my personal walk with Christ. Downright difficult to do, at least on a constant basis, but with Him?? Totally and completely possible and doable ... uh, and forgivable when we don't.
Thank you for this important reminder -- SO needed, and on a repeat basis!!
Hugs,
Julie
Beth,my friend, I love this post and your honest words. :) How did you know I needed these today? I almost read them late last night, but decided to go to bed. I woke up thinking in directions my mind ought not to go.
These words especially resonated with me: "God uses all of my experiences to conform me to his image so that I can, in turn, show the world what he is like." It goes along with my life verse. Thanks for your encouragements. :)
And yes, I agree with Carol. You've got to pick up Beth's book--the llamas, characters, story are wonderful!
So simply and beautifully said. Thank you. Can't wait to read your book.
Good morning Beth and Seekerville folks, I love your post of "What if's" I think authors have to write and let out what God has given them to say. As a Reader of your books-I have been given so much by the authors, a magical world absent from my humdrum life,characters that come to life and befriend me for awhile as I read their stories. I used to think authors were so different from the average person until I have had interaction with them on the internet and see them as just like regular folks with dreams-families-bills to pay-walking through this life just like me-Thank God they are just more talanted then I. sorry getting off my soapbox now-Have a great day all....
Paula O(kyflo130@yahoo.com)
Yes, less about me and more about Him. This is good advice for everything in our lives.
Beth, can't wait to hear how you DO it all, and do it so beautifully! You sound like one extremely busy lady.
I guess never-never land isn't all it's cracked up to be, huh?
PLEASE NOTE: TINA DOES NOT TAKE MY DARES. NO. SHE CALMLY MOVES ON AND IGNORES ME."
This bears repeating.
What an encouraging and exhorting post to read before heading to work this morning. No matter what we do in life, we need to remember it's not about us but about Him. How easy it is to forget that in the busy cares of life.
Llamas + Carol singing the book's praises = Must put this on the to-get list. (My amazon cart is getting full. :-)
Good morning, everyone!
My Wii awaits, but I had to stop by here first and visit with y'all. Such a friendly bunch of folks.
Tina: Let me know when your deadline is past.
Virginia: Oh. My. Word. Someone respects you even though your write romance? That gets filed under the "The Things People Say!" file. I wrote an article for a Christian newspaper & a friend said "Oh, we line our birdcage with that paper."
Ouch.
Ruth: Thank you for the encouraging words & all the virtual goodies!
Sherrinda: I hang around smart people. That helps a lot.
Sally: May things go better for you at work today.
Debra: "Never" is now one of my favorite words. ;)
Mary: I am printing your prayer out right now.
Walt: Adding your "Why" to the list.
Debby: Thank you for the hugs. I am a hugger!
Karen, Thank you for joining the conversation!
Janet: I'm learning lots about walking out the journey along the writing road. Some days I do it better than others.
Audra: I've got to find out about your thing with llamas. Let's just say with WYWH, it was either llamas ... or aliens.
Julie: God's forgivenss and his lavish grace: that's what I hold onto!
Jeanne: Love you friend!Can't wait to see you SOON!
Loved your post, Beth!
This line really resonated with me: "God’s definition of success is all about embracing the scriptural command to become “less than” ( Matthew 20:26) as he provides opportunities to say, “Let me introduce you to an amazing God who has changed me in a miraculous way.”
That's what happens all through the gospels - we meet people like John the Baptist, Peter, the Centurion, the Samaritan woman at the well...and what do they do? They point to Jesus. Every single one of those people makes us see what Jesus has done in their lives.
What a great goal for a story teller.
I've also learned never to say never. I once said I'd never want to live in Kansas City (while driving through and seeing the endless suburbs). Six months later we moved. Guess where?
Don't ever say God doesn't have a sense of humor.
I'm putting your book in my Amazon cart...
Beth, thank you for sharing your perspective. How many times do we forget that it's not about us, it's ALL about HIM. i love your books, and find things that i can use in my own attitude. Keep on keeping on for Him.
And isn't the cover of Beth's debut, gorgeous???
Did you get alot of input on that cover??
Welcome to Seekerville Beth and thanks for the reminder of why we write. smile
My mantra for years has been "Thy will not mine" But you would think it would stick by now. LOL
Walt hang in there, as Debby said, "You are so close."
Thanks again Beth, have fun today.
Tina, you are right. That does bear reapeating. LOL
POL: Yep, authors=regular people with both dreams & bills bills to pay.
Pam: I am thankful God shoved me out of Never-Never Land and into his perfect will for me -- even if I went kicking and screaming at times!
Jamie: Thank you for the welcome!
Clari: sounds like you love Carol as much as I do!
Jan: Ah, you've learned the "Never
Say Never" lesson too!
Marianne: Thank you for the encouragement today!
NOW ONTO TINA's QUESTIONS:
A day in my writing life:
I'd love to say it's smooth sailing, but it's more about juggling the interruptions and keeping my focus on the deadlines. Book #2 (Catch a Falling Star) is now with my editor, so I'm waiting for feedback and the next round of rewrites. (There are always rewrites.) CAFS is a stand-alone, not a sequel to WYWH, but it's set in CO too. I'm a wife and a mom, so I'm constantly balancing both ends of the seesaw: real life vs. writing life. And, yes, my house is not the cleanest on the block.
I detoured to writing fiction thanks to a season of burnout. I said I would never, ever, ever write again (I was that exhausted) and God used the burnout to redirect me to the "Dark Side" of the writing road, i.e. writing novels.
Hi Beth,
First congratulations on your debut! I've heard nothing but glowing comments about it and so am thrilled to be in the drawing for a chance to win your book!
Second, your words are SO timely. I've been wallowing in a big ball of confusion, doubt, "my writing's never going to be good enough", "where do I go from here" pit these last few days. Stewing in frustration and getting nothing done.
Your words have given me a fresh perspective - I need to let go and let God. It will work out as intended.
Thanks, Beth! And we'd love to hear about your road to publication. Gives us hope!
Cheers,
Sue

Great post Beth, and reminder too. Thank you.
Blessings,
Jodie Wolfe
Oh, my beautiful friend - promise me we'll spend at least a tiny bit more time together than we did last year at conference ;). One quick hug, while passing cookies off, just won't cut it this time :D.
640 words on that /gasp/ historical Mellie's makin' me write - while sitting at the doc's office. Time to get some more words in :).
Cannot wait for the next book, Beth dear, am not pleased it'll be so long :D.
Great post, Beth!
THE DARK SIDE???
What were you doing before this detour?
(THE DARK SIDE?)
And boy does this BEG for questions.
As a NF writer how did you transition to Fiction?
Where did you start?
What resources did you rely on?
Do you have a critique group?
Before fiction I was a nonfiction writer and editor (GASP!) who tossed the "never" word around all the time about fiction. Hearing voices? Take meds, please! I edited Connections, the leadership magazine for MOPS International, among other things.
When I first wrote fiction it was just for fun -- I only told one friend. Then I was invited to join a critique group by Donita K. Paul. What a blessing. After meeting Susan May Warren, I attended all of her My Book Therapy retreats -- and shredded my manuscript.
;o)
WYWH was a 3-year process.
I love the My Book Therapy writing community and I plot all my books using The Book Buddy -- and then I write a fast draft, kind of my own personal NaNoWriMo.
I' blessed to also have Rachel Hauck as a mentor too. She and Susie challenge me to up my game with every book.
Pardon my typo in my last post.
"I'm" not "I'."
The editor in me is cringing.
Ya'll are such a friendly bunch!
Sandra: I like your mantra.
Susan: I pray God blesses the works of your hands. (Psalm 90:17)
Jodie: Hope you were encouraged.
Carol: You better believe there will be more than just a quick hand off of cookies this year at ACFW!
Waving to Paula, my fellow MBT Ponderer!
It appears I have been remiss.
The coffee pot is empty.
Apologies all around.
It is now plugged in and brewing (Rocky Mountain Blend) and we have a fresh plate of sliced peaches from Grand Junction. With pound cake.
I am officially re-filling the pot... and I've brought sweet tea for the lot o' youse!
I'm seeing in these comments that we're a community of real folks here. And by real I mean that we do whatever Tina says....
Or cringe, trying.
Having said THAT.... ;)
Let me just add that Virginia Carmichael, my new LI buddy, stupid folk abound in this world. Part of the free will loophole I guess, because I gotta tell you...
I AM LOVIN' ME SOME LOVE INSPIRED BOOKS, LOL!
And when that signing check comes...
And those royalty checks....
And you can pay for that new floor....
It feels real good. But even more, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that I can envision folks reading a Ruthy-book for $5.
$5.
How wonderful is that when so many books are priced out of current middle-class budgets and then go on sale for $3.99 at your local bookstore.... Tables and tables full of them at my last book signing. The $14.99 and $16.99 was X'd off and $3.99 written over it.
Looks are deceiving and part of our job as businesswomen is to see beyond the hype and realize our worth. So you just keep on writin' them thar romances, sweetness! And tens of thousands of folks'll be readin' 'em. Guaranteed!
Deb, I love your replies to all...
You've the heart of a warrior and the smile of a gentle queen.
Walt, she's right. We dream, we hope, but mostly we work. And we keep on, keepin' on. Hang in there....
Moncado, I love llamas. And alpacas, too. I keep suggesting to Dave we put a couple of alpacas or sheep in the side yard, a wetlands area. Trust me, they can only improve the bog-like essence. And they won't bother my Peepers and Frogs!!! My plan is to suggest gently and then tell him how much it's going to cost for me to rent him a bush hog to whack the growth out of there...
I may make the brush hog sound a little more expensive than the fencing for the alpacas.
Possibly. Because I'm creative that way.
I will keep you posted! Beth, nice job using wildlife in your book. Wildlife that spits.
Great minds think alike!
Radcliffe, I'm pretty sure that you don't take my dares because you're a chicken.
Don't quote me on that.
"bawk...bawk....de bawk!!!"!
Beth, LOL!!!
Novels equates Dark Side...
Oh, that God.
And here you are.
Bless you!
Good morning,
Thank You Beth for this post, I have a couple extra days off work and needed some encouragement (some courage) to get on with my writing stuff.
Seekervillians, you have said before that you pray for all of us. I am having some trouble getting my blog heading in the direction it is supposed to go. Could you please pray about that for me? You don't have to dwell on it, just a quick word or two to get me going.
Thank you, all of you.
OK, y'all:
Here is how you get someone to take dare:
You say, "I double-dog-dare you."
There.
Done.
How can a person not take that dare?
(Are you reading this, Tina?)
Now, to the llamas:
Whenever I hit an "I don't know what to write next" moment, my husband Rob would always say, "Is this when the aliens show up?"
My reply: "I don't write aliens."
(GASP! Wait ... I never said "never.")
Anyway ... one day we were driving through Estes Park doing research for WYWH and spotted llamas and he said,"How about llamas?"
And I said,"Llamas sound like fun."
So, llamas it was.
And thank you for sweet tea and sliced peaches. Just perfect!
Mary:
My blog story, to encourage you:
My first blog was a bust. I loved the idea, but it just never took off. So I stopped it.
And then I waited. And prayed. And waited. I knew I "should" write a blog, but that wasn't reason enough to start another one.
Then, during a bout of insomnia, I had an idea:
I love quotes. People always commented on my FB page when I posted quotes. So, why not marry those two ideas?
My blog is now "In Others' Words." I highlight a quote and share a thought about it and then ask a question to start the conversation. I keep the post short because there are so many blogs out there.
My agent loved the idea -- and said I should have insomnia more often.
Um, no thanks.
:O)
Praying for you -- to discover your blog niche, not to have insomnia.
Here's a theory of mine that works it's way into my books sometimes.
God's priority is our souls. I don't think God looks down on a decent Christian going through something hard and feels bad for his child if our souls are with him. To God that is triumph.
We pray for health and career and money and relationships and we should and God is with us, and helps us and gives us the desires of our hearts...if it helps our souls be right with him.
I think once we start thinking of ourselves as this fiery vivid kernal of an eternal soul, and understand that God sees that and all that surrounds it is infinitely less important, it changes the way we live and the way we believe and the way we treat the world.
My dad was a strong man of faith and he died a really slow, painful death from cancer. He was 72 and he'd lived a long life, but of course we wanted more. My mom and dad had the most congenial, loving marriage I've ever seen and when he died she was simple, truly broken hearted. It took her four years to say a single word about the future because she wasn't looking forward to a future, other than being in heaven.
Eight brothers and sisters, spouses, grand children galore and we were all mourning.
I think God sees that and He only knows that a soul that was committed to Him has come home and that is Victory.
So this blog, Beth, just rings so true to me. Very encouraging and a great reminder of what is truly of value in this life.
Beth, honey, if you get to a spot where you're stuck, please adopt the Mary Connealy Method of Plotting.
(everyone say it with me)
SHOOT SOMEBODY!
(it's true that this works better in westerns, I acknowledge that and yet I urge you to include gunfire when ever the plot sags, it never fails)
It can be a metaphorical bullet I suppose but real flying lead is usually best.
Virginia, you didnt' tell us the rest of the story, like how your 'friend' looked face down on the sidewalk with your foot on her neck.
Mary, I'm 4600 into this thing and no gunshots yet.
How many am I behind?
:D
WALT. most of us keep writing for one very simple reason.
We can't stop.
If we could, we would.
Carol, I'm not saying you're doing it wrong or nuthin' but, if you ever get to a slow spot, definitely keep the Mary Connealy Rule in mind.
Mary:
Thank you for sharing your story with us today. It touched my heart so tenderly.
And, yes, I am now writing the words "SHOOT SOMEBODY" on a piece of paper and posting it near my desk.
My poor, poor family is really going to wonder.
Except for my son. He's a writer too.
I didn't shoot anyone in WYWH.
But I did break someone' knee.
BWAHAHAHAHAHA
And that was based on a true to life incident.
Wait! I didn't break the person's knee ... but I was there when it happened.
Beth, gasp! What are you doing here??? And lamas, Beth? They spit. And smell. (I lived for 10 years in Bolivia.) But it is indeed unusual!
Mary Cline, yes, yes, and yes. If it's one thing these gals have taught me, it's that asking for prayer and praying for our goals and dreams is NOT A BAD THING.
I'm such a dork. Hugs to you from upstate and yes, prayers too.
I'll MAKE Mary pray. She won't like it, but she'll do it.
;)
Sweet tea and llamas.
Now this is my kind of drama.
Maybe a random shooting or two. Beth, that's a hoot. I can totally see that happening!
Ruthy, the thing is... I LIKE romances. So, part of me was sort of offended that romance reading was not repsctable. I mean, we're not talking erotica here. I even love the hints of romance in some of the YA, where you know as the character grows up, there are going to be some SPARKS with a certain character.
Call me a romantic.
And I love this company Love Inspired, these editors, these sweet people... AND the other authors. So, myself aside, it felt sorta personal.
Like someone insulting your beautiful, smarty-pants big sister because she's a girl.
Mary Connealy, she's actually a dear friend so... I just put it up next to the tally marks of all the rude stuff that I've said TO HER without realizing it. :D
We're a bunch of big mouths.
Beth, I love quotes!!! I'll have to check that out.
And can you tell us your first sale story? How did you find your editor/publisher?
Those covers are GORGEOUS.
Congratulations on your debut, Beth! I've heard nothing but good things about your book. It's on my TBR list.
Great, great advice, Beth--thanks!!!
I experienced both sides of the "success" coin just this week. I needed to look up some info about one of my books on Amazon, only to discover some "low-star" reviews had been added. Well, I followed Tina's advice and decided not to even read them, but just the knowledge that they existed was enough to gnaw at my spirit.
Then yesterday I got the sweetest, most positive and complimentary note from the copy editor who's working on my next book to be published. Her words were such an encouragement, a reminder that, yes, I AM a good writer, and my stories do make a difference.
And that's what we all really want, isn't it? Not so much success and recognition as the knowledge that God is using our stories to touch people's lives and hearts.
Yeah for you for not reading that review. Folks give negative reviews if their order is late. For goodness sakes...like that's the author's fault. But it all messes with your mind.
And yeah for the copy editor!!! Nice words are always welcome.
Tina Radcliffe
Please ignore any and all typos from here on out. I am the world's worst typist.
About my cover.
That was quite the wild ride. But the art director at Howard Books ultimately went with a live model, and also bought a wedding gown (the gown is almost a secondary character in WYWH) and even a bouquet to match the one in the book. I love my cover. I love the wedding ring dangling off the title.
First sale story: Rachelle Gardner, my agent (can you say blessed beyond measure?) sent me a cryptic "Today or tomorrow might be a very good day" email.
EEEK!
Then, she called me while I was driving through Denver. There were a lot of "Did you say I got a contract?" repeats ...
I managed to a) stay on the road and b) not get lost.
My husband took me out to dinner that night to celebrate and then we celebrated with the whole family later that week at Rodizio's Brazilian Grill (which also shows up in WYWH! I believe in weaving real life into my novels.)
I just love first sale stories. It's such a natural high...
But right now I dragged along a plate of cookies, Beth, just for you and our friends because ya' gotta love a woman who puts llamas in a book.
These are chocolate chip/peanut butter chip/M&M cookies, and they are to die for.
There is no limit on cookies in Seekerville, so make yourselves comfy-cozy! Enjoy!
Beth, it is a great cover. And I'm not surprised that you love writing non-fiction and that fiction has now caught you in its grasp.
What are your coming projects? Anything you can share?
Beth, I love this post. Hope you're saving these for YOUR book on writing. And I found a better super-strength deodorant in England (made in Japan). Ran out and paid extra to order 6 more on Ebay.
I'm grinning. Llamas, shootouts, mouthy friends face planted on the floor... You all are a hoot, today!
Thanks, Ruthy. I was getting hungry. And those cookies look Mahvelous!
PS Congrats on multitudinous blog post response comments!
Catch a Falling Star (May 2013) is in the hands of my editor even as I type. (Doesn't that sound ominous?)A contemporary romance, this novel asks the question:
What do you do when life doesn’t go according to plan? Do you hold onto to that elusive Plan A? Dust off Plan B? Or do you just settle?
Catch a Falling Star reminds readers that romance isn’t just for twenty-somethings and that sometimes letting go of your “wish I may, wish I might” dreams is the only way to embrace everything God has waiting for you.
I'm also perking on several other novel ideas ... and many readers have asked for a WYWH sequel.
'God uses all of my experiences to conform me to his image so that I can, in turn, show the world what he is like'
FANTABULISTIC POST! A big amen from Canada to you, dear sister in the Lord because I could NOT agree more!
Oh my goodness, this just BLESSED me- seriously! These are very precious and wise words
Thank you!
I am so glad that I - and You- and everyone else - stopped by!
Blessings to you Beth,=)
Ganise
I love your attitude:) enter me! The description of this book sounds really good! Clp1777(at)aol(dot)com
Dee: Thanks for the recommendation of that stronger deodorant. We all should stock up before the round of 15 minute appointments at ACFW, eh?
(Do we still have plenty of cookies? Has Carol dropped off her gluten-free stash?)
As y'all can probably tell, I like to write novels that wrestle with questions ... questions like: Can God redeem our mistakes? We say we believe that, but do we truly believe that in our own lives? That was the hidden question behind the kiss-gone-wrong in WYWH.
With each of my stories I like to nail down the Story Question that drives the story from page 1 to "The End."
And, yes, each one wrestles with how we think we know what's right ... and what's wrong ... or what's best ...but do we? Have we really listened to God --or have we ignored him or just accepted some preconceived idea of Truth?
Hi Beth! Thanks for the perspective on the writing journey.
BTW, I heard your radio interview with Ken and Kristen on 100.7 KGBI in Omaha, NE last week and your books sounds great! Kristen's a good friend of mine, so she told me about the interview in adavance so I'd be sure to listen!
Ah, Rodizio's !!! Lucky girl and so deserving.
Great first sale story and love the bridal gown story too!!!1
Thanks for sharing.
Tina Radcliffe
Amazon bought Avalon?? Ruthy, point me to the info pretty please?
Nancy C
Beth - of course, there's GF cookies when you're around my friend!!!
I didn't try any last year [was soooooooo over cookies by then ;)] but I may this year so I can compare to my nonGF ones...
>> Beth said: I detoured to writing fiction thanks to a season of burnout.<<
Wow and double wow! Same experience. I wonder how many others this has happened to.
A lovely "re-focus" post, expressed so simply. Thank you.
Nancy C
Hi again!
Is Amazon going to own everything soon?
Beth I love the cover of your book! I can't tell if the bride is coming or going. And the blurb doesn't give it away either. I will have to read your book! It's on my list. Maybe the top of my list.
Stephanie, glad you got to hear my radio interview. I only "heard" it when we taped it.
:O)
And Carol, thanks for the GF cookies.
Anybody else GF?
Here's the link for the Amazon purchase of Avalon Books...
I'm hot-wiring the link as we speak...(Ruthy climbs under driver's seat, pulls off wire casings with her teeth, reaches up, inside the console, grasps the ignition wire and:
Amazon Sale Info Here
Shazaam!
Ruthy hot-links the Amazon Ammo!
Film at eleven!
Such multi-talented people here at Seekerville!
Shazaam is right!
Ruthy, sounds like you've hot-wired for real at least once in your lifetime....
Beth, thanks so much for being here. I don't know what the weather is where you are, but in Highlands Ranch we just ended a tornado warning.
Now just rain. I love rain.
Thank you Beth! I appreciate your honesty and reminding us all of Who we need to focus on in this writing life. Blessings from Georgia, Patti Jo :)
Hi Beth! I found a link to your site through the Armchair BEA blog, and was interested to read about you and your book. I would love to be entered for a chance to win a copy.
Thanks!
Muzette
Loved the interview. Would love to win.
G'night all! Being here was the highlight of my day!
Thank you for the reminder of what success really is. Sometimes I forget!
What a great post - thanks for the reminder that we are to desire and seek God's success for our lives - not man's.
all these Colorado peeps are making me homesick. i'm a Denver native transplanted to Virginia Beach... oh, to get back to the mountains, but my husband has gills (avid scuba diver, ret Navy) so returning to a land-locked state doesn't look like a possibility right now.
love this post. looking forward to reading the book (so many books, so little time *heavy sigh*)
absolutely LUV your 'success' thoughts! how true and how revelatory... ty for sharing Beth!
enjoyed meeting you at the debut party online and getting to know you better today! bless you ~

Hi, Beth.
Thanks for this wonderful and timely reminder. In all the self-promotion and social marketing we as authors are supposed to do, it can be easy to lose sight of the real reason we're in this whole writing 'business'.
Congratulations on having your first fiction novel published - it looks intriguing!
God bless
Sandra Peut
Why indeed!!

Wonderful post Beth. I love the cover of your book Wish You Were Here! Would love to win a copy. Thank you for the opportunity.

Great post. Absolutely 100% correct! If only we would learn to perform for Heaven, not for man!

with
CONSUMER STAPLES
Like most "defensive" sectors, the Consumer Staples sector has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 5 years, with a total return of 43.2% (vs. a 10.3% total returm fot the S&P 500).
> some of our top-rated Consumer Staples dividend stocks. Note that our composite rating ranges from 0 (lowest) to 99 (highest).
All of the stocks on the list above have a current dividend yield of at least 2.2% and a 5-year beta under 0.50. Also, all of these stocks have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 5 years (on a total return basis). The tables below highlight some of the key data points that we analyze when ranking our dividend stocks.
Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) currently has our coveted "99" overall Parsimony ranking, which is the highest ranking in our system. Wal-Mart is one of the best dividend growth stocks of all-time and it is a member of the S. In addition, the company still has a very modest payout ratio of 31.9%, so it has plenty of room to continue to increase its dividend in the future.
Hormel Foods (HRL) carries our highest rating for Dividend Track Record (99) and it is also a fellow member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. Hormel as a very modest payout ratio of 30.3%, so it has plenty of room to continue to increase its dividend in the future.
General Mills (GIS) has the highest Risk/Reward Profile ranking (92) of the five stocks highlighted above. GIS has delivered shareholders a 65% total return over the past five years, and it has increased its dividend at a compound annual rate of 11.0% over that period. In addition, the stock has the lowest beta (0.17) of the group, with a very nice dividend yield north of 3.0%.
Kimberly-Clark (KMB) is also a member of the of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (are you seeing a trend here???). KMB has the highest dividend yield (3.5%) of the five stocks mentioned and a very respectable 5- and 10-year dividend growth rate of 7.0% and 9.5%, respectively. The stock has also been on fire the past 12 months, with a total return of 24.5%.
To say that Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is a stable long-term dividend pay 52% total return, and it has increased its dividend at a compound annual rate of 12.0% over that period.
Conclusion
Any DIY Dividend Portfolio should include several stocks from the Consumer Staples sector. Stocks in this sector tend to be stable dividend payors with low relative betas, which will help dampen overall portfolio volatility.
In Part 2b of this series, we will highlight our specific "Buy Zones" for each of these stocks, so please make sure to "follow" us.

Everyone whines about the Chinese "doing unto us," what with the artificially depressed yuan and all that.. But these days, we are doing unto the Chinese — and right nicely. Unfortunately, that pain may also flow both ways. And I'm not just talking about Washington's threats to slap on a billion or two in new tariffs.
Let's start our rundown in that grand old port city, Hong Kong. We have all become quite accustomed to Chinese double-digit growth year in and year out. Indeed, the Chinese are so sanguine, they have structured their entire financial system around the care and feeding of such astonishing gains.
In a recent Bloomberg economists' survey, the median estimate for September was for 6.5% growth. And not a one of the bean counters would guestimate a decline.
Hong Kong Freak-Out
So one can understand why they are freaking out when September sales to the United States and Mainland China fell 8.9% and 7.3% respectively. Shipments of electronics are off 16%, while outflow of T-shirts, undies, and the like fell 8%. The HK government has described the situation as "bleak."
Asian apparatchiks are not famed for their free use of hyperbole. They prefer vanilla words like "moderate" or "restrained." The last time I heard "bleak" was when the Korean Chaebol were collapsing back in 1997; it was usually followed up by an abject apology to coworkers and family and a quick dive out an upper-story window.
The folks at Morgan Stanley and Daiwa Capital Markets fret that Hong Kong has already tipped into recession in the third quarter, seeing as how it saw its GDP fall 0.5% in Q2.
China Runs Out of Gas
Let's follow this thread back across to the Chinese mainland... As mentioned above, the Chinese are literally banking their financial lives on permanent growth.
According to the number crunchers at BlackRock Investment Institute, in 2002, a yuan of GDP growth required roughly 0.17 yuan in credit. A decade later, that figure has doubled. It now takes 0.3 yuan in loans to generate the same amount of biz.
To give you a sense of these things, that's like discovering your daily commuter car's gas mileage has dropped from a fair 30 mpg highway to an awful 17 mpg. Certainly takes a chunk out of your bottom line, eh?
BlackRock's Neeraj Seth puts it succinctly: "China has become a less profitable place to invest" when "growth requires an ever-increasing quantity of inputs."
No wonder, then, that China's bottom line growth is shrinking...
Screaming Bloody Murder
This decrease in banking profits has all sorts of causes. On the one side is the immense increase the Chinese are paying for goods.
The most recent reading for Chinese inflation is September's 6.1% per annum — down a whisker from August's 6.2%, but certainly terrifying nonetheless as, once again, we see Chinese industry getting less bang for buck (or rather, yuan).
Beijing did make a show at slowing cost growth. A recent report out of the People’s Bank of China has aggregate financing — including bank lending, off-balance sheet loans, and bond and stock sales — dropping 11.4% to 9.8 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion) in the first three quarters of 2011.
Can you imagine how loud Wall Street would scream if it lost 12% of its borrowing power and 6% of its purchase power? Well, that's exactly what's happening in China...
In the end, Premier Wen Jiabao was forced to loosen lending curbs. And China's banking regulator announced this week it will allow a higher bad-loan ratio for small companies threatened by the lending slowdown.
Diseased Loans
Finally, let's take a closer look at those bad loans.
Fitch Ratings estimates as much as 30% of China’s banking system loans — some $2.46 trillion all told — could go all "nonperforming" on them.
This brewing collapse harkens us back to the breakdown of the Keiretsu and Chaebol back in the 1990s. While the West's attention was focused primarily on the well-established corrupt cronyism in Japan and South Korea, Beijing was quietly bailing out its four biggest banks to the tune of more than $650 billion.
I'm not the only analyst around who can smell the coffee. International investors have been quietly sliding out the back door on Chinese banks for over a year now.
As of early October, the MSCI China Financials Index had lost more than half of its value!
The New Asian Contagion
Why, when we have so many troubles here in the West, do we give a rat's behind about our chief competitor's banking breakdown?
Over the past four years, China has created 40% of the planet's GDP growth. Four of the world's biggest banks by market capitalization are Chinese, and the country holds 31% of all foreign reserves. To paraphrase JFK from way back in the dawn of the global age, when Beijing eats that big bullet, we will be Beijingers.
The Play
It's not all doom and gloom, mind you. While the investor in me is terrified that China's slo-mo banking crisis will plow directly into an already-weakened Wall Street, the option trading half of my brain sees this as an opportunity to rake in put contract gains. The Asian collapse of 1998 cost the Dow some 21% of its value in a matter months

In July 2010, I wrote an analysis of the generic Taxotere (docetaxol) patent fight between Sanofi-Aventis (SNY) and the generics Hospira (HSP) and Apotex. In September that year, I reported that the District Court ruled in favor of Hospira and Apotex, finding that Sanofi's patents were invalid. I had predicted Hospira would jump on the news, and it did.
Today the Court of Appeals affirmed that verdict, agreeing with the District Court's rulings that the patents were invalid and also unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. The news hasn't seemed to move either stock, which isn't unexpected since Sanofi-Aventis had a very difficult task trying to get the District Court's ruling reversed.
The case isn't completely over just yet, though, as Sanofi-Aventis could seek Supreme Court review. However, that's extremely unlikely to be granted (the Supreme Court only takes about 1% of all cases it is asked to take and this one doesn't raise any issues of general importance). Therefore, I doubt this matter will have any future impact on the underlying company valuations.
Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

By Michael Rawson, CFA
Dividend-themed exchange-traded funds have been a popular choice among investors over the past year. The 42 dividend-themed ETFs that we follow raked in $16 billion in flows, nearly a third of every dollar going into equity ETFs, despite the fact that they make up just 5% by count of the 812 equity ETFs available.
With the dividend yield on the S&P 500 Index at 2.1%, well above the 1.7% yield on the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, who could blame investors for looking to equities? But be cautious when hunting for yield, particularly when moving up the risk ladder from bonds to stocks. Over the past five years, the average dividend ETF has had a volatility of 23%, more than 6 times greater than the 3.6% volatility of the Barclays Aggregate over that same time period. The highest-yielding stocks are more volatile than stocks in general, so dividend ETF investors should consider the stock-selection process employed by the fund. One ETF that gets it right is Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), one of the most successful ETF launches of the past year. While we like the approach of this fund, the valuations in some defensive sectors have become stretched. In addition, investors often pile into popular funds at the wrong time, as my colleague Adam Zoll outlines here.
Suitability
Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is a suitable core holding for investors that want a focus on dividend-paying stocks and are comfortable with the large-value tilt this fund provides. This ETF holds 100 stocks that meet various criteria, including 10 years of consistently paying a dividend and a high composite score on a four-factor model of financial strength. Perhaps most important, it follows an adjusted market- cap-weighting approach, which results in a tilt toward large-value companies. Because of this tilt, investors should be aware of how this portfolio might overlap with existing portfolio holdings.
The rationale for investing in dividend-paying stocks is strong, as dividend-paying stocks have outperformed nonpayers over the long haul. There are many reasons for this. Glamorous stocks with high expected growth rates rarely pay dividends, so the excess returns to dividend-paying stocks might be explained by the value premium. Paradoxically, academics have found that firms with high dividend payouts actually experience faster earnings growth. Additionally, dividends can be a check on corporate governance. If firms do not have investment opportunities that will earn a rate of return above the cost of capital, they should refund capital to shareholders. Particularly in the current low-growth market, it might be better to return capital to shareholders than to invest it in risky ventures with low return prospects.
Fundamental View
In this environment where economic growth has slowed and there are fears that growth may slow further in Europe and China, investors are paying a premium for quality stocks. Defensive sectors such as consumer staples, health care, and utilities all sell at a premium price/earnings valuation multiple compared with the overall market and a premium to their trailing five-year average. Meanwhile, more economically sensitive sectors such as energy, industrials, and materials sell at discounts to their five-year average P/E multiple. The explanation for the valuation disparity is that if the economy slows sharply, the earnings of these economically sensitive sectors will get hit harder. It's important to remember that defensive sectors will not be immune, but the dividend yield on this fund should help cushion the blow.
Morningstar equity analysts cover 99% of the assets in this portfolio and 84 of the 100 holdings. They assign discounted cash flow based fair value estimates on each stock, which can then be aggregated to the fund level. They see the portfolio trading at a price/fair value of 0.93, compared to a more attractive 0.88 for the S&P 500. As for quality, 64% of the assets in the portfolio are rated as having a wide economic moat, Morningstar's measure of sustainable competitive economic advantage and a good proxy for quality. That compares favorably to the 44% in the S&P 500.
Since this ETF does not yet have a full year of trading history, the Morningstar.com quote page does not display a 12-month yield (which is always calculated net of the expense ratio). However, we can get some idea of the yield on its portfolio by looking under the Portfolio tab, which shows that the stocks in SCHD have a dividend yield of 3.31%. This is above the 2.28% yield on the stocks in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) but below the 4.07% yield for iShares Dow Jones Select Dividend Index (DVY).
Portfolio Construction
The fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, a new index from Dow Jones that starts with the top 2,500 U.S. stocks after excluding REITS, master limited partnerships, preferred stocks, and convertibles. Only stocks that have paid a dividend for 10 consecutive years, have a market cap above $500 million, and have $2 million in average daily volume are considered. These stocks are then sorted by yield, and the bottom half is removed. From there, four factors of financial strength (cash flow/total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and five-year dividend growth rate) are equal-weighted, and the top 100 stocks are included in the index but then weighted by an adjusted market-cap method. As such, this fund is dominated by large-cap behemoths like Wal-Mart (WMT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Procter and Gamble (PG). An adjustment is made to ensure that no stock is more than 4.5% of the fund and that no sector (as defined by Dow Jones) is more than 25% at the annual reconstitution and quarterly rebalance. While weighting by market cap can lower the yield relative to other dividend weighting strategies, it also lowers the volatility. This fund has an average market cap of $62 billion, greater than the $55 billion of the S&P 500. Relative to large-value funds, this ETF has higher weightings in consumer defensive (30%), industrials (17%), and consumer cyclical (8%) and relatively lower weightings in financials (3%), utilities (3%), and telecom (1%).
Note that this index is different from the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index, which is tracked by iShares Dow Jones Select Dividend Index (DVY). That index weights stocks by dividend per share, which has resulted in some odd weightings, more of a mid-value tilt, and an untimely overweight in financials just before the crisis in 2008. While we prefer this new index followed by SCHD to the one followed by DVY, it is yet to be seen whether it will stand the test of time.
Fees
The fund charges a very low 0.17% expense ratio, which was the lowest among dividend-oriented ETFs until Vanguard recently lowered its fees on VIG and Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VYM) to just 0.13%. However, as a new fund, SCHD is likely to have higher market impact cost, which eats into the return when trading frequently. While it does trade a respectable 166,000 shares a day on average, it is still advised to use limit orders, particularly for large trades or in volatile markets. Investors on the Schwab platform can trade this and other Schwab ETFs commission-free.
Alternatives
Many of the top holdings of this fund are also held in one of our favorite dividend- themed funds, the aforementioned VIG. VIG is really more of a quality fund than a dividend fund, as it has a high percentage of wide-moat firms and a dividend yield barely equal to the yield on the S&P 500. VYM offers a higher yield than VIG and has more of a value tilt compared with VIG's slight growth tilt. Both funds charge 0.13%.
SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) charges 0.35% and seeks out firms with a 25-year track record of increasing dividends and weightings by yield, resulting in a narrow list of 60 companies with a mid-value tilt. WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN) charges 0.28% and weights stocks by total dividends paid. This results in a large-value tilt because the larger companies are able to pay the largest dollar amount of dividends..

In September, most of the world’s major central banks doubled down on their bets.
Since the spring, the spread between the Barclays High Yield Index and the 10-Year Treasury note has narrowed from 608 basis points at the end of May to 475 basis points today:
(click image to enlarge).
In one sense, tighter spreads are justified. U.S. corporate balance sheets look pristine, with S&P 500 companies sitting on more than $2 trillion in cash. That’s equivalent to more than 7% of their market cap, the highest ratio since the early 1960s. As a result, default rates are only around 2%, which is half of their long-term average.
Yet investors still need to be cautious. Spreads at this level appear rich not only relative to their historical average, but also particularly in the context of our current sub-par growth. High yield is the most economically sensitive of all the fixed-income segments. With economic growth stuck in the 2% vicinity, spreads would typically be closer to 600 basis points over Treasuries, as opposed to the current level of under 500 basis points.
And this all assumes the U.S. is able to avoid the fiscal cliff and a recession 2013. While investors are starting to factor the fiscal cliff into their equity decisions, it is not clear that they are doing the same for the fixed income portion of their portfolios. If a trip over the fiscal cliff puts the United States back into a recession, then high yield would likely disproportionately suffer compared with other fixed income asset classes.
This is not to say that further spread tightening is impossible. Improving conditions in Europe, a favorable resolution to the U.S. fiscal cliff (along with a willingness to address longer-term structural budget issues), and a steadily improving economy could all help to lower risk premiums, bolster corporate credit profiles and allow for further spread tightening. In fact, spreads have been considerably tighter in both the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s. But those environments were characterized by much faster growth and less systemic risk. The problem today is that it seems unlikely we will return to those conditions anytime soon.
Longer term, I still like high yield as an efficient way to generate potential yield with a reasonable amount of volatility. In addition, for more aggressive yield-focused investors – which we’ll define as those with a target yield of 4% to 5% – there are simply few alternatives. For the rest, and particularly for more tactically minded investors, this is probably an opportune time to reexamine your high yield exposure.

On Deck: GE’s Friday Surprise
General Electric (GE) is due to report its Q1 results in the pre-market on Friday, April 17. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report a profit of $0.21 per share on revenue of $39 billion. While most of Wall Street has shied away from GE, and for good reason, the time has come for a rebound on the heels of an in-line or upside earnings surprise.
From a fundamental point of view, the company maintains a healthy cash position and increasing revenues from the energy infrastructure and technology infrastructure segments. In addition, the company has signed new contracts and expanded a manufacturing facility in China, improving margins on related products and expanding its foothold in a country likely to become an ever greater economic engine.
The GE Capital credit concerns have been overblown and investors have been stepping back into the stock, pushing it up from staggering lows in the 6’s recent to over $11. There is still time and room to run. With a health dividend yield of greater than 10% and the sector’s lowest P/E, most investors would be wise to get paid while waiting for the stock price to rise.
From a historical price reaction perspective, when it comes to pre-market earnings events GE tends to see follow through gains or losses from the pre-market to the regular session close. In other words, the stock tends to follow-through with the trend that develops ahead of the open.
While we anticipate a positive reaction to any in-line or above estimates results, extended-hours traders tend to be right on with GE. As history shows and from a risk/reward standpoint, its best to just go with the trend.
On Jan. 23, 2009, shares fell 6.1% in the pre-market session after the company reported earnings in line but missed with revenue. The loss fattened to 10.7% in regular trading later that day.
On Oct. 10, 2008, GE rose 0.5% in pre-market trade after posting Q3 results in line with Street estimates. The stock recorded a sharp rise in the regular session, soaring to a 13.1% gain in the Oct. 10 regular session.
On July 11, 2008, GE declined 0.5% in pre-market trade after meeting earnings expectations, beating on revenue, and backing its fiscal year view. The stock turned positive in the following regular session, eking just higher, up 0.07% by the closing bell.
On April 11, 2008, GE tumbled 11.5% in pre-market trade after missing Q1 expectations and setting its guidance below Street estimates. It added to its downside in the following regular session, losing 12.8% by the closing bell.
On Jan. 18, 2008, GE advanced 2.3% in pre-market trade after meeting Q4 expectations and maintaining its 2008 guidance largely in line with the Street view. The stock added to its upside in the following regular session, gaining 3.3% by the closing bell.

HOUSE PROUD; Decorating With an Ear For Eames and R&B
By PENELOPE GREEN
Published: December 22, 2005.
''I thought that if I surrounded myself in everything from that vintage and wore everything from that vintage,'' she said, ''I would transmogrify in some way. Obviously I was at some sort of psychological stage.''
In any case, she had found Ms. Gottwald while looking for the rug, she said, ''that would change my life.'' It was a 1940's powder blue Karastan, advertised in the classifieds of The New York Times by a man named Paul Fuhrman, who specialized in buying and reselling the contents of restaurants and hotels. At home with her new rug and old chairs, ''I was really lost,'' Ms. Budoff said. She appealed to Mr. Fuhrman, who suggested she meet Ms. Gottwald, a snappy designer with a rich sense of humor.
Ms. Gottwald and Mr. Fuhrman had met when Ms. Gottwald was redoing the interiors of the Cavalier Hotel in Miami Beach; she later hired him to restore some of the Algonquin's furniture when she redesigned that hotel's interiors in 1990. (Note to Mr. Fuhrman: send up a flare. Both Ms. Gottwald and Ms. Budoff are pining for you. ''He just vanished,'' Ms. Gottwald said.)
Anyway, Ms. Gottwald continued, ''I think Paul thought that if anyone could make the Chippendale things work with that rug it would be me. I do remember saying that if there was a lot of space between them they could be in dialogue.''
Or at least d?nte. Ms. Gottwald would arrive at Ms. Budoff's apartment, and they would push the furniture away and sit on the rug. Ms. Budoff would serve cocktails and maybe some gospel, and Ms. Gottwald served little tutorials on midcentury modern furniture, or contemporary fabric, or Murano glass. Theirs was a happy collaboration. Ms. Gottwald, who once followed Ornette Coleman around Manhattan for an entire afternoon just for fun, delighted in Ms. Budoff's music and tried to design with all the equipment in mind. Ms. Budoff, a member of three audio clubs -- each an orgy of cable and component swapping -- is very, very serious about sound.
She described 11 years spent with a pair of delicate Quad 63 electrostatic speakers with tenderness. ''That's a speaker that broke my heart,'' she said. Tired of fixing them each year, she has run through a series of replacements. These days, a pair of Aerial 10T's, hulking, blond maple obelisks, are planted at the top of the down stroke in her T-shape apartment, which is where the living room is. Stewart House's low-ceilinged apartments with their dead-end alcoves flatten sound, particularly the bass end. ''One of our disappointments is we were not able to make the room perfect acoustically,'' Ms. Gottwald said. Placed as they are, the Aerials produce the best sound possible, but only if you're sitting in the living room.
''The sweet seat,'' Ms. Gottwald explained, ''is in the center of the mohair plush sofa by that famous 40's designer, Anonymous.'' (That's another Paul Fuhrman pick.)
They took it slowly -- buying pieces over the years as Ms. Budoff's budget allowed. Most of the Chippendale left to make room for an Edward Wormley couch and credenza, an Eames chair and a shiny black lacquer cabinet. The rest was slid into the bedroom with Moby. ''That's where we put Margery's old life,'' Ms. Gottwald said. A few years ago, Ms. Gottwald took Ms. Budoff to visit an elderly aunt in Ocean Grove, N.J., and to visit the flea market there. Ms. Budoff met her first vintage vacuum coffee pot, a 10-cup, double-handled Silex Delray, bulbous and alluring, which she bought for about $25.
''I walked towards it as if in a trance,'' she said. ''I didn't know what it was, but I was determined to get to the bottom of it.''

Well, I might not be able to pronounce her name correctly but Seher Mahabra‘s self-titled album is a truly great electronica record offering up an eerily perfect blend of classic 60s sounds and the trippy beats of today. Add her sublime vocal style to the mix and you got yourself (yet another Twin Peaks-esque) winner! I heard it at a friend’s house last night and I’ve been obsessing over it all day. Check her out on Bandcamp here.

“I don’t want your twenty million,” was essentially what the email I sent said. Did the money actually exist… who knows?
Arranging a film deal is a very new thing to me and I am the first to admit that I am totally out of my depth. But one thing I’ve learnt, is there is one tool that each of us have in our kit bags when it comes to making deep water decisions and that is our intuition.
When people are being overly secretive; when they are clearly trying to manipulate you into making a fast decision; when they are hugely overstating and exaggerating both what they have done, and who they know and what the future holds; in short when they are talking too much… beware.
Making a film is a long process and involves literally thousands of people; people who are trusting you; they are trusting that you will pay them and they are trusting that the film they are working on will be ‘terrific” and actually get made.
If your intuition says “I don’t trust you”… then maybe you shouldn’t do business together especially if there are other people involved and the price is twenty million.

A few months ago the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine launched a website bringing consumer health information together with easy access to their related research. The NCCAM is a branch of the federal National Institute of Health that was created in 1998 to further scientific research of medical modalities and substances currently outside conventional mainstream medicine, such as acupuncture, nutritional supplements, and therapeutic touch. Their goal is to use that research to help clearly define where these modalities may integrate, or not, into more mainstream medical practice.
I applaud the website for being easy to use and for bringing so much consumer and practitioner information together. Finding current and past research is a snap and I appreciate their focus on informing consumers. The inclusion of a link to the Cochrane Review website is extremely helpful for finding quick, down and dirty, clear information on specific conditions and modalities based on reviews of published findings.
However, I was dismayed by what I found while searching through the acupuncture research. The first main problem was that hundreds of research projects that were funded by the NCCAM lacked published results, many of those studies being completed well over 5 years ago. Without being able to see the results of so many studies how can the public know basic, vital information related to NCCAM research? Why were the studies completed but never published? The second glaring problem is that many of the published studies were terribly designed, suffering from minimal to no blinding or controls, a serious lack of clear and reproducible materials and methods, and weak statistical analysis. The results from such studies are at best unusable and at worst harm the status and viability of acupuncture as an integrative medical modality. Poor science is worse than no science, and after over a decade of NCCAM funded research we are left with mountains of poor science. While looking over the Cochrane reviews, the large majority lamented that the evidence from available studies was inconclusive due to poor study quality and that more research needs to be done. Only a few conditions could reasonably be stated as responsive or unresponsive to acupuncture. A quick search on PubMed reveals that only recently have researchers been really pushing for better quality acupuncture studies. It seems incredible to me that the NCCAM would fund the poor quality studies they have for so long, and leads me to question how bad the ones that never got published were by comparison. I am left shaking my head in wonder at the apparent lack of concern for the the quality of research funded over the past 12 years, what a sad waste of resources and time. The serious implications of this problem include the growing movement to de-fund the NCCAM all together and to push complementary medicine out of use and back into the fringes of quackery where they think it belongs. With more than a decade of terrible research to back them up, who can blame them at this point?
My next step is to investigate the funding approval process in the hope of finding out where the system has broken down and how it can be improved. With so many people invested in good science and the promise of complementary modalities such as acupuncture, there must be a way to reverse the trend and start producing some high quality scientific studies. Whatever the outcome, whether acupuncture is found to be useful or not, we need solid scientific evidence to help guide us.

This is the front view of this art piece. See the next image for a view of the inside.
This book that has been handled by many has crossed a threshold and become a object of art. The very idea of taking a piece of Library property and altering it seemed wrong. Yet someone else did just that. That individual purposely slashed the front cover into six pieces cutting all the way through to the first page. I took the remains of this book and created a new book. Like a wound that grows scar tissue, this new book does not attempt to cover or mask what has happened to it. I have read every page and selected many to be sealed away from any future reader. I established specific criteria, leading me to embellish some pages and to sew others together. Some of the text has been deselected while some text has remained to create portions of a new story. In its new incarnation, the book sometimes reveals a grim fairytale and sometimes shows us that poetry often lies just beneath the surface. This book should be viewed as something new, as well as a reminder of what happens when individuals take censorship into their own hands.

�New Mexico doctors who perform breast mastectomies are now
required to inform their patients of the option for breast reconstruction. Sen.
Timothy Jennings (D-Roswell), who wrote the law, lost his wife to breast
cancer.
�Students who like to ditch school can have up to 10 days of unexcused absences before the state defines them as “habitual truants.”
�Teachers can’t whack their kids upside the head anymore. A
law banning corporal punishment in schools goes into effect today. But Mom and
Dad can still go wild. At the time she signed it into law, Gov. Susana Martinez
referred to corporal punishment as a decision “best left to a parent.”
�New Mexico has numerous state songs and symbols. Sen. George Munoz‘s (D-Gallup) law adds to that depth by making the Native American squash blossom necklace the state’s official necklace.
�Dead service members are no longer on the state’s jury
list.
�The state commission of public records can now accept private donations as long as they specify what agency function they’re meant for.

leaving it open spike from between $5 and $10 to between $250 and $1,000.
�Advertisers who say their chile contains New Mexico chile peppers had better make sure those peppers were grown in the state. If not, they can now be sued under the Unfair Practices Act.
�Got one too many Xanax pills? People who have an excess use

Hello lovelies! I am Casey L. Jones and I am an American digital artist born in 1981 which means I am 31 years old *eek!* ;-) I've been designing websites for going on 8 years and have won awards for my work. All of my design skills are completely self-taught and I am in love with all areas of art and design. When I am not designing websites for my world-wide clients you will often still see me at my computer screen. Generally I will be hammering away on my keyboard writing or immersed in Photoshop creating fantasy artwork. The themes of my artwork range from fairytales, romantic themes of fantasy and mythology and/or artwork with a historical nature. I often include castles, ghosts, fairies, dragons, historical couples in love and nature elements in my work.Jul 23rd, 2011

Meet the sweet potato gelato from il laboratorio del gelato. It's pure deliciousness. It tastes just like a baked japanese sweet potato, but colder and smoother. I loved it so much I bought a tub. haha. I bet my mom would looooooooove this.
You should take your fatty ass to the LES location near Katz Deli. The place looks so sterile, you could probably lick the gelato off the ground. =)

Everybody poops. Even this chick.

<|endofexample|>
6 hard-boiled eggs
1 tbs harissa
1½ tbs good Dijon mustard
1 Green onion, finely chopped
2 tbs Red onion, finely chopped
1 tbs Italian flat leafed parsley, finely chopped
6 Green Sicilian olives, chopped
2 tbs Capers
2 tsp Olive oil
Sea salt & fresh black pepper, to taste
Tomatoes – I used local Juliet Tomatoes (courtesy of JBG)
If they’re not available substitute with large grape or small roma tomatoes
Lightly make a ‘+’ incision on both ends of tomato using a sharp knife. Then drop in boiling water for 10 seconds, remove and plunge into a bowl of iced water, the tomatoes should still be firm to the touch (shocking the tomatoes in ice water will stop the cooking process which otherwise would turn the tomatoes to a mushy consistency). Once tomatoes are cooled, remove from water, peel skin off, and slice in half. Remove seeds and insides with a grapefruit spoon or a small sharp knife. Set aside tomato husks.
Chop the eggs and combine with the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl. Mash and mix well. Gently stuff the tomatoes, firmly pressing the filling down. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.
If made several hours in advance of serving, brush with olive oil and black pepper to prevent the tomatoes from drying out.
Garnish with a few parsley leaves.

This news release from The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers offers great money-saving tips:
"Looking for ways to save money? Look no further than your kitchen. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) offers these simple energy savings tips to consumers looking for ways to cut energy bills this summer.
Refrigerators, dishwashers and clothes washers combined account for a 43% decrease in energy consumption since 2000. Replacing an eight-year old refrigerator, dishwasher and clothes washer with new appliances of average efficiency will save consumers about $95 per year in energy bills.
Replacing an eight-year-old clothes washer will save more than $60 in electricity costs and nearly 5,000 gallons of water per year. Additional savings can be obtained by purchasing Energy Star appliances.
Energy savings can also be obtained by following these easy tips:
· If you are replacing your refrigerator, do not use the old refrigerator as a second refrigerator. This will not yield energy savings. Properly recycle the appliance. To find recycling options in your area, call 1-800-YES-1-CAN.
· Allow hot foods to cool before placing them in the refrigerator; and always cover foods that may release moisture in the refrigerator.
· Limit opening the refrigerator and freezer doors. Label foods or use clear food storage bags to easily identify foods.
· Scrape, but do not pre-rinse dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. Dishwashers do a great job of cleaning soiled dishes.
· Take advantage of your dishwasher’s “eco” option that reduces water use, or use a no-heat air dry feature.
· Use load size settings- if you are washing a small load of clothing, be sure to change the load setting. Use cold water settings whenever possible.
· Always clean the lint filter on the clothes dryer after each use. A clogged filter will reduce dryer performance.
More information on energy savings can be found on AHAM’s web site."

Inspired by the rich, exotic and whimsical colors of hard surfaces like granites, carpet has grown beyond the neutral zone. Color can be playful or sophisticated, and it's easy to live with if you have children, pets or want to entertain.
Interior designers agree that every home has a place for an area rug. Layering in home decor is as fashionable as layering clothing. Don't hesitate to add color and warmth by adding a rug to hardwood, ceramic or even carpeting.

Dear Reader:
One of my favorite bloggers–Shane at GroundtoGround.org–recently wrote about a “new” protein option: mealworms. Yes, mealworms. Of course, eating insects isn’t really a new concept at all. It is very, very ancient. And this leads me to a topic that I’ve been contemplating the past couple of weeks, human diet.
What is the optimal sustainable diet for human beings? Can diet cure disease, especially those pesky autoimmune diseases that seem to be arrowing through our populations with debilitating, even tragic, effect? Will a diet that includes plenty of animal product ultimately destroy the planet? Or, looking at this from another angle, will a diet that restricts meat in favor of water-and nutrient-sucking monocrops like grains destroy the planet? Is it wrong to eat something with a face? And how does all this relate to the goal of living locally?
Obviously, I can’t answer all these questions in a single blog post. Heck, I probably couldn’t even scratch the surface in a single book. Here is what I’ve been reading and watching and thinking and doing this January:
1. Started out by watching the film FAT, SICK & NEARLY DEAD at the local library. This is basically the story of a man who was overweight and suffering from an autoimmune skin disorder who healed himself on a juicing fast. Theory: concentrated nutrients in the juice plus cleansing allows the body to heal itself.
2. Watched the film FORKS OVER KNIVES which explores the idea that diseases can be eliminated or controlled by rejecting processed foods and animal products.
3. Watched the film FOOD MATTERS which attempts to show that our highly-processed, chemicalized diets are causing health problems and gives solutions for healing.
These three films pretty much advocated for a diet VERY strong in minimally-processed, plant-based foods. Diabetes, heart-disease, hypertension, cancer, inflammation, etc. were all cited as consequences of our unnatural diet. I have a pesky asthma problem that I’ve been trying to heal for years now. I was excited to watch these films, and thought…well, maybe. I knew I wouldn’t go to straight juicing, at least if I could help it. For one thing, I didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a good juicer. For another, it just seemed a tad drastic. So I decided to give the vegan way of eating a try.
No. I have to go back even further.
A few years ago, I tried a macrobiotic diet which is almost vegan. It does recommend fish and shellfish products in moderation. While I liked the weight-loss that occurred and the energy I felt, my asthma did not seem to respond at all after seven months and my skin took on a rather sickly pale, yellowish tone. Soon I added meats back in my diet while continuing to eat a lot of veggies and fruits. I also began the process of trying to eat from local sources, including eggs, milk, and meat.
Cut to the present. So, vegan eating would be a challenge for me on a philosophical level. Rice isn’t grown in New England, right? But I went ahead and started cooking some of my old macro foods and tried some new vegan recipes. They were delicious, but no matter how much I ate, I couldn’t feel satisfied. This was different from the macro…because I was getting no seafood? Really? And as I continued to cook some local meats for my family, I noticed how those foods began to smell better and better to me as time went on.
Then, almost two weeks after giving up animal foods, I came down with a rip-roaring virus. I ached from the deepest part of my bones all the way out to my skin. As soon as I had some appetite back, what did I consume? Homemade chicken soup and a pint of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream! I either craved those animal foods because there was something nutritionally necessary in them or else I was still detoxing and craving what was bad for me. Which was it? As my grandfather used to say, damned if I know!
I thought I’d continue with the vegan diet for awhile, treating my body like my own little pet test rat. I sat down to watch an episode Peak Moment Television (check it out…very cool!) while eating a vegan lunch of mushroom/garlic/onion fried rice on a bed of arugula, and pow! A title caught my eye: The Vegetarian Myth. Wait a minute, I thought. Myth?
4. Scarfing down my rice and greens, I watched while the host of Peak Moment Television interviews Lierre Keith on her book, The Vegetarian Myth. Then I downloaded the book to my Kindle and have been reading it as voraciously as I had eaten that pint of Chunky Monkey ice-cream a few days before.
Talk about blowing the vegan theories out of the water! It wasn’t exactly all new to me, either, as I had read about Weston Price and his studies on traditional societies and their diets years ago. The skinny on the myth? Humans need meat. Oh, and civilization and agriculture are going to ruin the environment. Hmmmm.
5. Because I just can’t leave well-enough along, I had to google “vegetarian myth debunked” and discovered a plethora of counter-arguments. Try it! Oh, the fun we could have arguing about diet, nutrition, sustainability, civilization, animal rights, and justice.
***************** long pause*************
What did I eat today? Steel-cut oats cooked in a slow-cooker with chopped dried apricots and dates and a banana. Coffee with soy milk. Baby spinach, leftover rice, and macrobiotic nashime veggies: onions, squash, carrots & kombu (a seaweed) cooked slowly on the stovetop with a couple inches of water (really, really delicious, I kid you not).
Oh, and a natural ground turkey burger that tasted heavenly.
Between all the information about fat-soluable vitamins only found in animal foods to endothelial cells that heal only in the absence of animal foods I am a mixed-up, don’t-know-which-way-to-look-for-my-food human being.
And then there is Shane with his mealworms. Sigh.
A quick poll of my social media friends yields practical advice. Eat in moderation. Every body is different. Do what works for you. We are designed to be omnivores. Put bacon on everything (Good one, Scott C!)
Finally, I have to also think about my localista endeavors. The most local diet I can get in Maine is going to have to include animal foods, plain and simple. My local area is rocky and hilly…suitable for grazing animals but not necessarily for raising a lot of rye and wheat. Definitely no brown rice. I also have come to understand (or believe) that a sustainable agriculture necessarily includes animals in order to create a closed-loop system. In other words, we need something to eat the grass we can’t digest, to turn that grass into food we can digest, and to provide nutrients in the form of manure back to the earth. On this point, I have to agree with Keith rather than the vegan-diet proponents.
Perhaps–in order to heal a chronic condition or to detox from a western-style diet high in processed foods and chemicals and too much meat and cheese from nasty feedlots and meat-processing facilities, antibiotic-pumped cows and debeaked chickens and pigs laying in their own filth–a juice fast and vegan approach is a way to reboot. Then, when health is restored, eat foods from local, sustainable, organic farms similar to Joel Salatin’s Polyface Farm. Nix the processed stuff. Go extremely easy on the sugar. Eat lots of vegetables and local fruits. Meats and fats in moderation.
Like Michael Pollan concludes in his book In Defense of Food, perhaps the best prescription for a fairly healthy individual is “Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants.”
Perhaps.
What do you think?
Well, Shelley, this is a hot topic these days, and you have certainly researched it! If you’re still in the research phase, or open to a suggestion, I would recommend one more book. just because it addresses so many issues you mention: The Plan. by Lyn-Genet Recitas. The book only came out this month, but “the plan” itself has been around for a few years. I read a wonderful review of it a couple years ago, followed the links, looked into a consultation (fees started at $300.00), read everything I could find on it, and waited for the book to come out. I’m only part way through it, but feel like it’s a life-changer. She goes by the theory – and years of research – that every body is different, that low level inflammation causes most all of our health issues, from asthma to arthritis to cancer, and that the wrong foods feed and maintain that inflammation in our bodies. Dr. Oz did a feature on it a couple weeks ago, thought it made a lot of sense, and is having some people follow it, to see what results they get, so you could check it out that way, too. I’m going to read the entire book before I start the program, but I’ll let you know how it goes. Good luck to you!
I’ll check it out, Cindy. I’m convinced it is inflammation causing my asthma, but figuring out what is causing it? Whole ‘nother story. Plus it’s been since childhood, plus it runs in my family. So….will look at your suggested reading for sure. Thanks:)
I’ll be anxious to hear what you think. If something strikes a chord with me – and this did – I tend to jump in with both feet. It doesn’t always make sense later!
I think Pollan’s advice is good. Andrew Weil lives near us and is also big into the anti-inflammation thing that Cindy is mentioning. I am trying to pull away from dairy more and to keep track of how I feel daily
Oh, I’ve read Andrew Weil. Sound advice from him, as well.
I’ve always gone with…our canines were developed for a reason;)!! A friend of mine is keeping herself leukemia free by going paleo, very interesting post, love it!
Yes, Sarah, I also think the canine teeth say something about our omnivore diet. And our intestinal track is not the same as say, a cow’s; neither is is like a wolf’s. It is something in between. Thanks for checking out the blog:)

When a man doesnt feel respect from his wife, he looks somewhere else for. Listen, observe and ASK yourself, “How am I feeling RIGHT NOW?” When in doubt about any behavior from a man, ASK yourself, “Could I live with THIS the rest of my life?” You DON”T NEED to TRUST MEN, you need to TRUST YOURSELF, your intuition and your ability to make decisions that are right for YOU.

I didnt answer his calls/texts for a while and then he started showing up at my house and begging me to stay with him. The main reason that these changes are taking place is because they are beginning to take on the personality of that new someone that they have in their life. So i checked his facebook and there were messages about him sleeping with her on tuesday.
This causes them to use the Internet as a means to communicate. She told me that her mom sent the message to the guy replying with a smily face but i just dont get why she would have to delete the sent message but not the inbox.

Reena Sommer, a divorce and affair consultant and author of the lying compulsive book "The Anatomy of An Affair," observes that when cheating mates are working on a computer, they are often quick to close or change a program window whenever you approach. If you've been having sex and only lately she's been saying no, you need to ask her what the problem is and gain her trust enough to have her share the problem with you. Girlfriends having an affair have to be extremely well organized; their schedules are therefore punctiliously maintained. Timed passed, and by the start of winter he started talking about marriage. Just like me:) Whenever I watch this video I automatically feel better.

I learned something Sunday at church. The ancient words of the Bible are a mirror for us to see ourselves and learn from.
Take Adam and Eve, for example. They lived in paradise. They walked with God. They had the perfect life. So what does Eve do? She wants more. She wants to be like God and eats the fruit. Aren't we like that? Sure we are! We have jobs and have a good life, but we want more. You've seen it before...a man wants a better looking wife like his neighbor has and has an affair. A couple wants a home to look just like a magazine, so they go into debt and end up living paycheck to paycheck.
How about Cain and Abel? While they didn't have the paradise their parents had, they couldn't have had much of a hard life. There weren't a lot of people to deal with and that usually is where the drama lies, right? But Cain saw Abel getting praise from God and got jealous. Instead of doing the right thing, he decides to just get rid of his brother. No more competition.
The Bible is full of stories that help us see our human nature. The thing is, the Bible tells the whole story, full of the consequences of giving in to our selfish desires, so that we can fully see where we can end up if we live for ourselves and not for God.
God wants so much to be in a relationship with us. He missed walking in the garden with Adam and Eve. Can't you just hear the pain in His voice when they hide from Him and He calls out, "Where are you?" Can't you hear the anguish in His voice when he asks Cain, "What have you done?"
God wants us to desire Him about all else. He wants us to go to him with our thanksgiving, our pain, our excitement, our hurt, our love, our fear. He wants all of us...our heart, soul, mind and strength. He is not scared of our messy hearts. He can take it. He wants to take it. He wants to have all of us, the good, the bad, the ugly. What a great God!
So as you read the Bible, the ancient words, remember to look for yourself in the stories. Don't try to "pose" in front of the mirror, putting your best face forward. Just be yourself and really see your heart in the reflection of God's word.
p.s. Thanks John Ketchersid for an awesome sermon!
Great post, Sherrinda!! Maybe you should be writing devotionals? :-)
Thanks, Jessica. I think I would have to co-write with my husband, because I am just sharing what I'm learning from his sermons!
Oooh I loved this post! I think you should co-write/write them as well! Such great truths and I always get tingles when I read or think about God wanting intimate time with ME! Nobody, ME! :)
Aw, Jessica, you are sweet. Isn't God's love and desire for us just the most amazing thing? I love your heart, girl!
This reminds me of Melissa Tagg's blog last week about reading stories in the Old Testament and trying to figure out why God chose to put them there. He has a purpose for each story - and on the surface they may not seem to relate to our lives, but when we dig deeper and really seek to discover what God would have us learn, we see it clearly. No, I don't relate to Noah's ark building days - but I do relate to being in a world of moral decay. Others laughing at my choice to live a life free from worldly passions. Trusting God to provide for my family when the tides of destruction devour others. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. Thank you for the reminder.
Gabrielle, thank you for that beautiful comment. I have always thought you had the most beautiful heart.
Really, REALLY good stuff today, Sherrinda. It's funny, Gabe mentioned my blog post from last week and that's what I thought of as I read, too. Those people in the OT...um, some crazy stuff happened. But then I think of my life...our world...the stuff I do...and I realize I'm really not so different. We all need a Savior. Trying to convince ourselves any different and hiding behind a mask is just silly. Love how you said he's not scared of our messy hearts!

Yes. "Present The Best You." FROM A WOMAN WITH A BLOG ENTRY CALLED "MASHED POTATO BOOBS." I give Monster a whole lot of credit.
But hey: if you want to find me on BeKnown, a new Facebook app that lets you professionally connect with others on FB, just click here! BECAUSE YOU TOTALLY DO.
*************************************************
Now, yes. Mashed potato incidents aside, I AM gainfully employed and have actually held very real, very professional jobs.
And also I did write a post once a job interview I went on, several years ago, where I casually and obviously without forethought mentioned that I had a blog which was kind of a disaster almost.
You can read the whole post here but the point was, well. I was an idiot. I had no business bringing up my personal blog during a professional interview because I did NOT want the interviewer (a VP no less) to read my blog because of all the writing about bruises and dates and plus swear words. And back then, waaaaaaay in the blog dark ages of 2005, I was blogging anonymously, so it's not like Googling my name would have landed the VP on a post where, say, I have brilliantly sketched myself drinking directly from a red wine bottle.
But you know? Times have changed. We're not blogging anonymously and many of us aren't Facebooking or Tweeting or checking-in anonymously, either. Now every job interview begins with a thorough Googling and perusal of your social media life.
And you know that. And maybe (hopefully) if you're in the land of job-seeking, you have thought about your online reputation. You know what happens when you Google yourself, you know what images appear on Flickr, you know you haven't hidden all your FB albums. Which is great. Frankly, I'm not here to tell you otherwise. As someone who shares pretty much everything with the online world, I'm not about to tell you that you need to password-protect your life in order to be hired. But guess what I do have?
Three tips on how to approach interviewing when so much of your life is online and findable (from one social media junkie to another):
1. "Be Prepared" takes on new meaning. Research them, of course. But research you, too.
With so many fun tools at our fingertips, being prepared for your interview doesn't just mean looking at the hiring company's website. It means finding what others are saying about the company. It means looking up who's currently working at the company AND who used to work there. I also always go searching for information about the people who will be meeting with me -- it's not always fair when they have your resume and you don't have theirs, so BeKnown and LinkedIn can really help even the playing field.
Ah, but it's also a smart idea to take a deep breath and Google yourself. Maybe you've done it a million times already, but do it again. What story are you telling? If there's anything you stumble upon that you'd be embarrassed for an employer to see, take it down. If it's in the public domain, it's perfectly acceptable for an interviewer to bring up.
2. Don't Be Yourself. Be Better.
As I well know (OMG HOW WELL I KNOW), we are all flawed. We all spill and trip and bruise and say embarrassing things. We all have unkempt days (WEEKS) and untidy lives, inside and out. Maybe your social media outlets do nothing but illustrate this. Hi.
But your potential employer's primary objective is NOT to know what "the real you at home" is like. Your potential employer needs to know what you at your best is. What is your professional you? What are you capable of doing every day in your best version of you? What will you show clients and coworkers? What are you like when you're "on"?
Your interview is your one opportunity to supplement the online version of yourself with your other dazzling assets. Dress up. Speak well. Shine your shiniest self. And whatever you do, don't let the informality of social media lead you to believe that you are friends with your interviewer; just because she left a comment on your blog post or is now following you on Twitter doesn't mean you're now BFFs.
3. Practice, Practice, Practice.
Um, so, it's established that you're online a lot. Your interviewer knows it, you know it. By virtue of you reading this post, I know it. That means that every conceivable tool for "acing" the interview is at your disposal -- assuming you're a good fit for the job you're seeking. Your interviewer shouldn't be able to ask a single question that catches you off-guard. Nope. Not one. So tell me, do you know where you'll be in five years? Do you know your greatest weaknesses? Do you know how to not only answer questions, but give examples and quantifications with your answers? Do you know why manhole covers are round?
Here's a fantastic list of questions you should arm yourself with answers to before heading into any interview, including (my favorite): Who do you follow on Twitter, and why?
Thank you so much to Monster.com for this opportunity, and specifically to BeKnown, a fantastic new Facebook app that "allows you to set up a professional profile directly on Facebook...separate from your personal Facebook page." Handy, no? I mean, networking right on Facebook makes a lot of sense. Keeping your photo albums separate does, too. :)
Oh, hey. Monster.com furnished me with a makeup kit and business card holder for participating in this contest and you can win a kit and holder, too! Please leave a comment (ideally you will also join BeKnown) and you're as good as entered! Contest ends January 9 (EOD) so GET GOING!
About BeKnown:
Monster.com recently launched BeKnown, a professional networking app for Facebook. BeKnown allows you to set up a professional profile directly on Facebook that is completely separate from your personal Facebook page. One of the apps newest features, College Pages, even provides a way for alumni to network professionally on Facebook and view job postings from their fellow graduates!
With BeKnown College Pages:
- Any jobs posted by alumni on BeKnown are added to the College/University profile page and Alumni with job opportunities can post jobs to students and recent alums for free
- Students can follow their school and build relationships/connections with alumni working at top companies & discover alumni jobs
In addition to College Pages, BeKnown.
“As soon-to-be college graduates start to think about their entry into the workforce, their first step should be building out their professional networks using the invaluable connections they have right in front of them,” said Tom Chevalier, Global Product Manager for Monster Worldwide. “Alumni networks are a key source for career opportunities for college graduates, so we wanted to make it as easy as possible for them to connect and engage right from BeKnown.”
Just signed up through Facebook. Thanks for sharing K!
Words to live by Kristy! Loooove the "Don't Be Yourself. Be Better." tip. They can see some/enough of the real you on social media. The polished you can be quite powerful in comparison and make you "mighty" real. (cue Sylvester)
Could totally use the card holder. And let us face it...the makeup kit as well.
Smart, smart, smart!
I'm on BeKnown! I could certainly use a makeup kit. :)
Your blog is very informative "i like it " job interviews.Salarydom empowers job seekers and employees with salary information for jobs at a particular company.
Thanks for sharing a good info .
So what will they read into "I don't use Twitter"??
I probably shouldn't tell them the real reasons:
1. I already spend far too much time with the electronic distractions of modern life, so there just aren't enough hours in the day for me to jump on the Twitter train, too.
2a. My cellphone is almost un-twitterable, it's so rustic.
2b. And I'm too cheap to put money into a smarter phone and the data plan to support it. (Well, if "I'm the only breadwinner in my family and we're already living paycheck-to-paycheck, so we're making do with what we have" counts as "too cheap", that is.)
Thanks for the good interview tips, chica. And for the chance to win the goodies.
Definitely great advice Kristy! Thanks for sharing the link to BeKnown too, can't wait to start using it.
I'm Signing up today.Thanks Kristi!

And makeup? What's makeup? ;)
Kristy! Can I say this in a loving way? I absolutely adore your blog. I think you're amusing and sweet and clever with a charming element of the ridiculous. And I know that your life has changed a lot and all, but I'm still really disappointed that your first post in a month was a sponsored one.
Please come back.
Thanks, you guys.
And Maggie (can I call you that?), I totally hear you! I agreed to do this back in -- wait for it -- NOVEMBER. I thought I'd have PLENTY of other posts done between then and now and that this would be just a little icing on the return of the blog.
So yeah. That didn't happen. But I agreed to do this post and had to honor the commitment.
The upside is, I did manage to post something. And forced myself to carve out time to do so. Which means I know I can do it again. :)
Great advice! Going to check out BeKnown right now!
I was also curious about the "I'm not on twitter" thing. Does that put people in a certain "not one of us" group? Cuz I have the fancy phone...but use it to (gasp) call people, and skype, and text...and possibly facebook but I don't like the tiny buttons and am always "liking" things by accident...
And yes, please do come back soon :).
I'll be job interviewing (again, ugh!) this spring, and you've given me a few things to think about as I start. Thanks!
And also, makeup? Yay!
Love this, Kristy! And now I am totally curious about mashed potato boobs...
Long-time reader/lurker here. Interesting post!
It seems like with so much emphasis on teaching our kids about their online reputations that it's easy to forget about our own! Thanks so much for this very important reminder! Going to Google myself now because it's been awhile and will definitely remember to be better than my best! Thanks again!
I am very serious about managing social media outlets and visibility. My FB feed is personal and only people that I am comfortable seeing my personal information and activity from work get to see it. I've also got work-related social media presence (like my twitter feed linked here, for example), so that when I want to geek out and when I want people in my professional circles to see what I'm about, I've got somewhere to point to.
It's a real effort to keep up with security settings on the biggest and most-easily-accessed social media networks, FB and g+, but it's worth it.
Right on, Kristy! Great tips. Hope this post saves people lots of costly embarassment. And wins lots of makeup.
Wise words! If you put information out there, you should be aware that any of it can come back to haunt you. Yikes! Thanks for the sage advice as always, Kristy.
ps I need make up to look better than my tagged photos at my interviews...
Great ideas, Kristy!
Happy to see you blogging. Missed you. And, oh yeah, how on earth do you do it with two????
Great tips - show them THE beat version of you, always!!!
There is some anxiety that a future hospital site may discover that I wrote a post about selling children to gypsies.
But as long as I only want to work with adults I should be fine.
Right?
Wisdom. That's what people gain from this post. I don't think it's so much our generation, although we've done some stupid stuff, but the younger ones who live on line 24/7 and know nothing different.
Hey, maybe they'll be bloggers like us.
Anyhoo, they don't think. I see it at the middle school all the time and when you try and explain that what they put online lives forever, am met with disdain and disbelief. *sigh*
Whee for free makeup! Oh, and valuable interview tips. :)
Cool! Just signed up!
I replied to an ad posted on craig's list went in for the interview the next day and was hired because I told the company that I had worked for their competor and they didn't want to let me go. I have worked for them for 4 months now and I already got a raise....love social networking and smartphones....Kelly L
I'm in the social media bizz... all of my everything is not only public domain, but listed on my resume. It makes me (slightly) ashamed that I follow the entire cast of last season's Bachelor Pad on Twitter... I posted about hating that Grand Central was occupied during my commute, and got a response saying "don't make her late for american idol" -- I couldn't even be offended. ahhh..
I can't believe I had to wait soooooooo long for another post and it's basically an ad for an app. What about the diet? The kids? The holidays? What sorta hijinx have kept you away from us?
So glad I didn't waste time checking this blog over the past 3 weeks!
You're just mad because you didn't win random makeup and business card holders, Anonymous. Let's be honest here.

The Women of This World Are Hopelessly ShallowBy Megan Fischer | Author Blog Posts – Sun, Jul 8, 2012 10:23 PM EDT
This website is terrible. You should be looking to meet someone because of a nobler reason, like they inspire you. I don't deny your piece about nabbing Prince Harry has some elements of truth, but they are twisted. First, you shouldn't have to change yourself or your habits to make someone love you, this will only end terribly with feelings of betrayal and shame. Second, those who are following these rules don't care about him at all. He never truly had a normal childhood, nonetheless life, how was it not expected for him to rebel against the standards that came with his birth? Most people whom are hindered by rules and expectations rebel against them in one way or another, some more drastic than others. Therefore, by aiding in his rebellion you are shaming yourself in that you hurting your own health and reputation, and shaming him in the same way. Third, being superficial will most definitely not bring you his or his family's favor in any way. You are the only person who mayRead More »from The Women of This World Are Hopelessly Shallow

AsparagusBy Elba Harp | Author Blog Posts – Sun, Jul 8, 2012 10:02 PM EDT
Selland's market-cafe in Sacramento is an uncommonly good café and often a source of inspiration for foods to prepare. Recently I had some of their asparagus and loved the texture - slightly crunchy (definitely not mushy!) - and the hint of lemon flavor along with the olive oil and Parmesan. Upon inquiry I was told that the asparagus had indeed been parboiled for 2 minutes and then tossed with Parmesan, olive oil, and some lemon zest. So easy!

Getty ImagesA healthy lifestyle can take a lot of work. And for some, it may seem like it takes a lot of money, too. The reality is, however, that living a healthy lifestyle can save more money in the near- and long-term…not only for you, but also for us as a nation.
When it comes to understanding the costs of unhealthy living, we need to look at several aspects. We need to look at our individual lifestyles, our national lifestyles, and the costs that don't always come directly out of our individual pockets. When we do, here is what we find:
- Out-of-Pocket Medical Costs: The less healthy a person is, the more likely she will need to visit the doctor, and in more serious situations, will need medical procedures that can be very costly. Unhealthy lifestyles make up a huge percentage of healthcare costs, and unfortunately, very few of us have a full-coverage insurance plan. As a result, each visit to the doctor…each procedure required…inevitably is money that will need to come out of your own pocket.
- Unhealthy Habit Costs: If you are a smoker, it can put a major burden on your pocketbook. I'll never forget when I was in my early 20s, there was a major campaign in the subways of NYC adding up the amount of money people spend on cigarettes and therefore, could save if they stopped. They often equated the cumulative amount over a year to the price of a vacation. In today's terms, a pack of cigarettes costs about $4. If you consumed a pack a day, it would cost you almost $1,500 a year. Think about the vacation you could take on that! Now remember, the $1,500 is just the cost of the habit, not the cost of the potential diseases or conditions that may become a result of your habit.
- Less Income: The less healthy you are, the more likely you are going.
- Healthcare Costs: As we all know, healthcare coverage for our country is a very complicated and costly issue. What's more is that a lot of the cost can be avoided. It turns out that over 70 percent of our healthcare costs are specifically related to lifestyle decisions. In an interview of Dr. Steven Aldana conducted by WELCOA (Wellness Council of America) President Dr. David Hunnicut, the following statistics were revealed:
-, tobacco use and other preventable disease. Further, 70 percent of American deaths are attributed to strokes, heart attacks, diabetes and cancer, all of which can be influenced significantly through lifestyle choices.

A look at the shifting nature of gender roles, and how they impact male-female relationships.It seems we're perpetutally trying to answer this question: Is chivalry truly dead? And if not, should it be?
In Jenna Birch's recent YourTango.com." Read More: Are You An Equal Opportunity Dater?
?
Author Elizabeth Gilbert discussed this subject in a talk she gave for the 10th anniversary of O Magazine. She said the following: "We are at the beginning of a vast and completely unprecedented social science experiment. We are in the first generation of women in the history of mankind who have had freedom, autonomy, literacy, education, access to their own economic well-being, access to their own power... And we do not have thousands of years of strong, autonomous female role models to look to for how to solve our lives. We are all doing it for the first time, ourselves." Read More: 'Eat, Pray, Love' Author Takes On Marriage. There aren't dozens of male figures throughout history who were married to. Read More: How Feminism Harms Women
When the male reader commented on Birch's article, he addressed her as though she was a male-bashing feminist-yet she is far from it. On the contrary, Birch takes pleasure in relying on men for certain things. She says as much: "I want a guy to court me a bit... Grand gestures are wholly unnecessary. I just want someone I can count on. I want him to do the little things to make me sure he is the real deal." She wants the men she dates to be 70s, the feminist movement couldn't see this distinction, because it was men who ran the world. Men were the ones in positions of power. They held government offices, owned major companies, and ultimately decided everything; therefore, they were the ones holding women down. They were the enemy. Read More: The Backlash of Feminism." Read More: Can Powerful Women Find Love?
And then we wonder why chivalry is dead.
Yes, I do understand where that male reader was coming from when he said we couldn't have it both ways, but also understand this: If the guy I am.
What do you think? How was the shifting nature of gender roles impacted your relationships?

Lock Your Cars: Wave of Car Break-ins Continues
Three vehicles were illegally entered over the past weekend, adding to the several reported incidents in Shorewood and neighboring Whitefish Bay.
A rash of car break-ins across the village continued last weekend with three entry to autos. There were five car break-ins reported last week, and five car thefts over the past month in Shorewood. Whitefish Bay reported 10 break-ins just last week, and another dozen over the previous weeks. A car was ransacked, but nothing was stolen sometime overnight on Saturday while parked in a driveway on the 1600 block of East Lake Bluff Boulevard. It is not known whether the car was locked at the time of the theft, but there were no signs of forced entry, police say. A $200 Garmin GPS and $200 Nano iPod was taken from an unlocked car parked in the 4100 North Murray Avenue sometime overnight on Sunday. Another car, this one in the 4200 block of …

Any problems are both practical and symbolic. They have both short term and long term political consequences. And almost none of it portends well for President Obama and his Administration.

Under state law, a public employee may not provide services to a candidate or campaign during his or her work hours. Nonetheless, it is evident that your office has become an opposition research arm of the Obama reelection campaign.Mitt Romney’s campaign manager, Matt Rhoades • Offering a bit of a rip with a FOIA request sent to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick’s office, in response to a story released earlier today that claims that the former Massachusetts governor’s staff deleted e-mails before Romney left office. The key phrase in that statement above? “Opposition research arm.” Someone, please, make a T-shirt with that phrase on it. source (via • follow)
Romney staff facing heat over deleted e-mails: “The governor’s office has found no e-mails from 2002-2006 in our possession,” says Mark Reilly, current governor Deval Patrick’s chief legal counsel. What say you? Is the fact that Romney’s gubernatorial staff actively flew in the face of transparency a big deal?
OK, this isn’t nearly as sexy as, say, EveryBlock or the Sunlight Foundation. But throwing records of the past decade of crimes online represents a new era of transparency for a famously-guarded city. Or as Brett Goldstein, the city’s chief data officer and former police officer, puts it: “It’s a whole new era of openness and transparency. You determine your own analysis.” And on top of that, EveryBlock could totally plug into this database if they wanted to. Some have been a bit critical of what isn’t in the data — race, for example — but many analysts note that this is more than a lot of cities offer. You done good, Rahm! source

For Autumn/Winter 2010 Marios Schwab went with his gut, stripping back to basics and intuitively creating an intelligent, considered collection.
Picture it: Marios Schwab, age fifteen, the only boy at a Salzburg school that taught, in his own words, 'hardcore hausfrau sewing skills'. That kind of experience marks a fledgling fashion designer for life - indeed, you can see the traces of those 'hardcore' skills in every one of Schwab's painstakingly worked and worked-out collections - albeit sometimes masked by his complex intellectual explorations. This season felt as if Schwab had stopped thinking. Or at least, stopped over-thinking. For Autumn/Winter 2010 Marios Schwab went with his gut, stripping back to basics and intuitively creating an intelligent, considered collection women will instinctively want to wear.
At a time when fashion designers the world over are reexamining exactly what their brands should represent, Schwab very wisely looked back to his roots, not only through the sewing technique of his formative schooling, but the lines of traditional Austrian costume. His collections have always explored the dichotomy between a cold, Northern European rigidity and a Mediterranean corporeality and sensuality - hence, when Marios Schwab does a dirndl, we're not talking Von Trapp. Schwab's rigorous modernism is undoubtedly aligned to the current taste for minimalism - clean, bold lines, cut with a surgical sharpness he is more than equipped to create. He sliced his collection out of loden cloth, sculpting the felted wool into sensuous, curvaceous silhouettes that slice into and around the body. His dirndls were chopped across the thigh, his organic dÃƒÂ©colletÃƒÂ© scooped low to frame the breasts, sometimes rendered as lederhosen harnesses framing chest and back, while peacoats in melton wool were cropped away high, contorted into undulating shapes across the chest to echo the body beneath. Sounds tricksy and costumey? These were the most original and sensual proposals of the brace/trace taste for harnesses and bondage we've seen all season. Speaking of bondage, those hardcore hausfraus surfaced in sadomasochistic detailing - shiny metallic applications of utilitarian hooks, eyes and rings popped up around necklines and across both belts and waistlines of those firm dresses. Sometimes, those hooks were utilised as just that, forming anchors for braid to be wound through and lace down the waist with a corselet detailing. It sounds unwearable, but it was a mark of Schwab's innate taste and skill that, from their first exit, it was difficult to imagine a woman who wouldn't want to lace herself down into his taut frocks, so convincing was his vision.
It also counteracted, to a degree, ideas of Marios Schwab as a go-to cocktail dress label, as there was many an intriguing option for day. Zippered biker jackets and coats were rendered in tufted wool, bound down with hardware-strung belts, those dirndl dresses suddenly placed in a different context when worn over a neat silken blouse, while a shirt-dress braced in geometric ruffles looked fresh and effortless. That too is telling - these were clothes to empower, not encumber. His body-consciousness has always been about a genuine consciousness of the body rather than just a second-skin dress, and despite the severity of Schwab's graphic silhouette nothing in this finely-wrought collection looked stiff, self-conscious or uncomfortable. At the end, when Schwab came out to take his bow, for some reason he kept walking and walking until it became a lap of victory. Maybe, once more, he was going with his gut: after this glorious, victorious collection, it was beyond well-deserved.

I was having this hideously godawful nightmare the other night that I was at a coaching retreat with a bunch of people I'd never met. There were ten of us in a fairly small room. It was time for the first activity of the day, and I was tensing up for the proverbial "icebreaker" activity that was certain to follow. Our retreat leaders flips a switch on her Bose and Abba's Dancing Queen blasts into the room. "Everyone up!" she cried. "Dance!" I was completely horrified! Now? With all these people I don't know?
And then things got much, much worse. I realized I was AWAKE! It wasn't a nightmare at all. . . (pausing now while you all shriek)
So I danced, because NOT dancing would only make me stand out more, and people would be looking, and some extravert would try to pull me up for a friendly twirl or two. I tried to look as if I often danced with small crowds of people in brightly lit rooms before lunch, and tried not to glare at our retreat leader, who I happen to adore. But this was S-O going on her post-retreat evaluation. Two other introverts started easing back into my corner and we flashed each other a WTH?? eyeball text message.
Eleven hours later the song finally ended. Gleefully charged, the extraverts were chummying up together, and the introverts were sporting near migraines. Said retreat leader seemed very pleased that we were all "loosened up" and could get to work. Loosened up? Are you out of your mind, woman? Do you know how long it will take me to decompress from your opening torture routine?
Which brings me right smack to book sales and promotion. (Sound of Robin sighing in relief that this truly isn't all completely ran-dom!) As I sat there doodling and decompressing for the first hour of the retreat, I thought about how my aversion to dancing-on-demand just about perfectly sums up my entire Marketing Avoidance Profile (MAP). I'm sending this right over to my publicity person at Random House. You might want to get to work on yours.
M.A.P. FOR AUTHOR: MARY HERSHEY
When scheduling promotional events and activities for the above-named author, please bear in mind the following:
::: No loud music or bright lights. Prefers a quiet Goodyear blimp with book title emblazed across.
::: Introvert to extravert ratio > 1:3 preferred. If possible, please screen all event attendees and staff. Anyone that talks more than three minutes without stopping needs a timeout.
::: Author unable to perform most bodily functions upon demand. Includes smiling, dancing, speaking up or loosening up.
::: Author unable do the any of the following while chatting with teachers, students, booksellers, or librarians: Eat corn on the cob, spinach, sushi, fondue, use chopsticks or the latrine.
::: Crowds in small places tolerated for 60 minutes max. Quickly prepare exits at 61 minutes and beyond.
::: No Abba. Ever. No kidding.

Oh my. Oh myohmyohmy.
That calls for an hour of solitary confinement in a dim room lit only by scented candles. Go on now....
:)
Oh. My. Gawd. You did not tell me you'd been tortured! That sounds beyond hideous...
::shuddering::
(Gasp which sucks all the air out of the room:) Are you KIDDING!? Oh, no! Sometimes I feel like a great idiot visiting a church where the minister decides we all need to have a ten or twenty minute chat with strangers during the "welcome the strangers" section. That kind of stuff is HARD. I have to admit the urge to kick someone and cry would have been tough to refuse.
I really wish this had been just a bad dream. I'm roughing out the idea of a book launch, and this has sent me back to my corner with hives.
Oh. My. Gosh.
Yikes. This has me writhing in my seat in sympathy.
You crack me up. I mean, I'm soooo with you--just glad it's you and not me. Though, on the other hand, I hope ? to have some publicity tours when I get published. Eek.
Too funny.
Got me thinking about my MAP.
But gotta have a book first...so back to writing.
I remember going to a college lecture once where, strangely enough, they did turn on music and demand everyone get up off the floor (where we were sitting) and dance.
I'm stubborn. I stood up so as not to be trampled on, but then I crossed my arms and glared at anyone who so much as glanced my way. It wasn't very long before a number of people joined my mini-rebellion. The organizers profusely apologized afterward saying they had no idea the guy had this planned.
Gosh, shades of EST training! (Did they even allow bathroom breaks?) I feel for you! I think I would pull one of those little mascarade eye masks out of my pocket and put it on my face.
Your dream reminds me of church events where they would have everyone get up and massage the shoulders of the people next to them. Definitely awkward.
I like "Dancing Queen" though.
Nice post anyway!

Distribution limited to introduced populations, including those at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin Co. (Wehausen and Elliott 1982), the Ridgewood Ranch north of Ukiah in Mendocino Co. (Jurek 1980) the vicinity of Pomponio Creek in western San Mateo Co., along the Eel River near Kekawaka Creek in southern Trinity Co., and on the Hearst Ranch in San Luis Obispo Co. The total population in the state appears to be about 300. Fallow deer in California are yearlong residents of perennial and annual grasslands, coastal scrub, closed-cone pine-cypress, valley foothill hardwood, valley foothill hardwood-conifer, and valley foothill riparian habitats. Native to southern Europe, Asia Minor, and the Middle East (Chapman and Chapman 1975).
Feeding: Fallow deer graze green parts of grasses and forbs, and occasionally browse. On Point Reyes Peninsula, grasses form the majority of the diet during the wet season; forbs predominate in the dry season (Elliott 1982).
Cover: Use shrubs and trees for concealment, fawning, shade, and shelter from inclement weather.
Reproduction: Rutting is concentrated in open grasslands. Fawning occurs in the cover of shrubs and forests (Wehausen 1973, Jurek 1977).
Water: Rarely observed to drink at Point Reyes National Seashore. Water must be available within fallow deer range during summer and fall in Mendocino Co. (Jurek 1977).
Pattern: Grasslands interspersed with shrublands or tree stands provide suitable habitats.
Activity Patterns: Active yearlong. Crepuscular, nocturnal, and some diurnal activity.
Seasonal Movements / Migration: Home ranges have seasonal shifts related to availability of forage, and cycles of sexual behavior (Wehausen 1973, Jurek 1977). No elevational migration observed.
Home Range: On Point Reyes Peninsula in 1972-73, does and fawns moved throughout a 39 km? (15 mi?) area during winter and early spring, and concentrated in 2 areas of 8.3 km? (3.2 mi?) and 4.7 km? (1.8 mi?) during late summer. Bucks concentrated in part of a 7.8 km? (3 mi?) area after the rut in November until antlers were regrown in August. During the rut, bucks spread out, and some moved throughout a 39 km? (15 mi?) area (Wehausen 1973). In Mendocino Co., fallow deer concentrated in 4 central areas, of about 1 km? (0.4 mi?), during winter. They spread throughout a 73 km? (28 mi?) area during summer when forage was scarcest (Jurek 1977).
Territory: Not territorial, except that dominant bucks will chase subordinate bucks from a rutting area where estrous females congregate (Espmark and Brunner 1974).
Reproduction: Polygynous mating occurs in mid-October, with consequent fawning in June. Does have single fawns, and breed first at 16 mo (Chapman and Chapman 1975). On Point Reyes Peninsula, potential annual rate of increase of doe population was more than 11% (Wehausen and Elliott 1982).
Niche: Mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes may prey on a few individuals. On Point Reyes Peninsula, more than 50% of the fallow deer sampled had evidence of liver flukes, and 7% had lungworms (Brunetti 1976). In California, often sympatric with cattle, sheep, axis deer, or mule deer, and may share many of the same food species. May compete with cattle when available food is scarce. Conversely, cattle may improve habitat for fallow deer by grazing tall plants. On Point Reyes Peninsula, the presence of fallow deer does not alter the habitat preferences of the other sympatric ungulates, nor do fallow deer displace them from their preferred habitats (Elliott 1982). Referred to as Dama dama by some authors (Feldhamer et al. 1988).

I am an American. I was born and raised on American soil and have never called any other country home, although my family is certainly not native. It has been several generations since my ancestors immigrated, however, and I have no familial ties to any of those countries beyond my last name—which we have Americanized so that the ‘w’ is not pronounced the Slavic way, like a ‘v.’
Yet I have never seriously considered the notion of whether I am “proud” to be an American. I am grateful to live here, of course, but the word my family uses most often is “lucky.” Lucky that we don’t still live in the places my great-grandparents left and lucky that my generation has grown up with more comforts than my parent’s generation, who had more comforts than their parents. Pride connotes a “satisfied sense of attachment,” according to Wikipedia, and I feel more pride towards my home state than I really do for the country as a whole.
I mention all of this because of the Olympic Games, that monolith of hubris and honor for man and country that takes place every four years. Due to yet more luck and a lot of fortuitous timing, I watched the Games in London stadiums instead of on my couch. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I enjoyed at a level beyond words. I tried to train my wide-eyed wonder into critical consideration, though, because I want to call myself a writer. A lot of my consideration wound up involving these questions of pride, as well as the questions I had about why the British eat so many prawns (also, what is a prawn).
We cheered for America because we are American, sure, duh. But a lot of what we cheer for is nuanced by what wins. This was evident in NBC’s very particular coverage of the Games, focusing pretty exclusively on high-ranking American events or foreign athletes destined for gold (exp. Gymnastics, Usain Bolt). The BBC had several channels devoted solely to the Olympics, and showed everything. And evident by at least what I saw in the stadium of the Aquatics Center, the British cheer for the British because they are just really proud to be supporting Britain.
Union Jack stockings. Team GB hats, ribbons flags. Walking into Olympic Park, you could spot a Team GB fan a mile away. Although our countries share national colors, you could tell a US fan from a British fan not only because we kept trying to walk on the right-hand side of the barriers, but because we were significantly less red-white-blue-bedazzled. When we did carry our Stars and Stripes flag with us, the Olympic volunteers found it very funny to shout at us, “Go Canada!”
I spent most of my live-viewing hours in the cheap seats of the Aquatics Center, watching a sport I had loved, hated, and practiced daily from the age of seven to eighteen. There were a decent number of Americans who had crossed the pond for the event, as well as large pockets of flag-waving Chinese and Japanese fans and a number of enthusiastic French people. Mostly, though, the second level of the Aquatics Center was filled with average British citizens. They came because it was here, in this country they loved, and they wanted to support their country. The ones sitting around us also didn’t really understand swimming. And although they didn’t understand the importance of the lane a swimmer was placed in, or the order of the Individual Medley, what they did understand was pride. I came to support USA, sure, but I came for specific athlete’s specific races, wanting to see these outcomes first-hand. British fans cheered—loudly and enthusiastically—for every red-capped Team GB athlete who walked to his or her starting block. The crowd could barely have been half British; the way the stadium exploded the whole island could have been there.
The kicker was this: they rarely—pretty much never—won. Not just didn’t win medals, but didn’t “win” heats fast enough to advance to Finals, or even Prelims. There were a few exceptions, mostly by female swimmers, but Great Britain didn’t get the third highest number of Olympic medals from swimming (65 for Team GB). British athletes excelled in equestrian and cycling and sailing, among other events. And here in the Aquatics Center were average, mild-mannered Brits, of middle age and toting small children, wearing more Union Jack-adorned items than I thought could ever be manufactured, screaming their heads off for athletes who would do fantastically well but never achieve the level of success that we as Americans assume is par the course. When a swimmer edged into the Preliminary round in 16th place, there was more noise than when any other country won gold. I imagined American viewers at home—frowning, fuming, vowing not to watch the determining race—if a favored athlete finished 16th
Cheering for a winner and cheering for a team are two different things, even when they collide. Maybe it took watching the Olympics to understand this because I don’t follow/understand/care about football-basketball-baseball teams at home. You cheer for your team because you are damn proud of them, win or lose, and although you really hope its win, a loss won’t diminish your pride. British fans around us were so excited about being British that I almost wanted to be British, too, until I remembered the prawn thing.
During one of the American “upset” races, South African Chad le Clos beat Michael Phelps for gold in the 200 meter butterfly. Phelps glided in and le Clos took the risky short stroke and touched him out. Wearing our hand-made USA T-shirts and waving dollar-store flags, we groaned and watched the replay of the finish with the veterans’ dismay of looking to the clock to realize you’ve been beat, but also with a slightly wounded pride: Phelps was our national hero; he was supposed to win, he needed to win. Then we all stood for the South African national anthem and watched a close-up shot of le Clos trying not to cry. None of us could watch him so filled with happiness and demonize him for winning or beating “us.” As the three winners walked around the stadium getting photographed, le Clos was clearly overwhelmed, and Phelps whispered something to him about where to stand and how to hold his medal to the best light. Social media would comment about how ‘cute’ a moment like that was, the prodigy taking the newcomer under his wing, but nothing made me more proud to be American: Phelps had lost graciously. How often does that happen in American sports, among teams as much as among fans (did I mention I’m from Eagles country)? In a few days Phelps would become the most decorated Olympian of all time, and Americans could go back to gloating without thinking about what it means to support these athletes just because they wear our colors in a particular pattern. Sometimes pride doesn’t come from fulfilling one group’s definition of success. We clapped our hands raw as le Clos, Phelps, and Takeshi Matsuda left the stadium, and sat down for the next race.

I loved this, Dani! I thought a lot about this during the games. Having pride win or lose… It’s kind of how I feel about cheering on the Padres in San Diego. They are, overall, a losing team, but that doesn’t stop me from screaming until I lose my voice and ‘keeping the faith’ until the very end of September. During the Olympics, I got caught up in the hype, not being satisfied unless USA won. I think this largely stemmed from the fact that I didn’t have any sort of personal ties to these Olympians; with a team like the Padres, I’ve been watching my whole life, and even as the players change, the team and the spirit remains the same. Once I started really paying attention to the Olympians’ stories and thinking about how far they have come/just what it takes to reach their level, I was proud no matter the outcome. I was even proud of the non-Americans who had beat the odds to win a medal. Toward the end of the games, I realized that, for me, it wasn’t about my country winning the most medals, but just generally being blown out of the water (HA, swimming) by what humans can do.
This is too long. Anyways, you’re the best.
Agreed! It makes more sense with a baseball metaphor but I hadn’t considered it that way until I was finalizing the piece. And a lot of the team mentality is based on where you’re from- so being ‘from’ someplace while being in a place where everyone else is from somewhere else was kind of an odd feeling, because there wasn’t that implicit fanhood of well we’re all American let’s all cheer for the Americans. My parents still watch Padres games even though they haven’t lived in San Diego for 17 years.

You black women just got bamboozeled!The white women are masters of keeping a man.They know how to shut their mouth when in public,help stick by him so he will be able to buy her that house and car.And we black men have great respect to find a white woman to stick with black in this race based world.Tell me black women describe the welfare case worker that told you to kick out the father because he is no good!Yes that's right the white woman.You see a black woman don't want to go with a man that gets his hands dirty for a living even though we make 40 to 100 grand a year with super benefits!White women have respect for a man that does labor work.Without labor work you would not have roads,cars,houses,food,hospitals,etc. etc..Now do you see how people look at as stupid for turning down this great supply of good men!The white women deserve black men because they know how to build a man up!We black men are not no damn movie stars we are just regular people,we don't want to be used for someone to try to live like they are some movie star!That's why black women are single and DESPERATE as hell on a crisses level .Clean up your act you stint wash and doush,learn to cook,keep your mouth shut in public,stop telling everybody all about your damn personal life,stop going out all the time like your a paid caberay singer,Until you learn what to do with a man stop begging for one.You did not even care about the black man until the white women picked us up,you had us to yourself for 400 years through slavery and racism.You talked about us and treated us any ole way because we had no where else to go.Now the black man starting get the reconition he deserves your caught without a man and holding onto a welfare check or working in a high rise overly dressed to hide that ain't got no man.And no the white man ain't gonna pick you up because he done had you for the last 400 years!Sparks fly between us black men and white women but black women white men battery been ran out!!!
I do not think white women are master's at keeping men. My mother has kept a man for over 35 years, I have aunts who have managed to keep men, I myself have kept a man for over 9 years. We are all black women. I know countless many white women who are single and divorced. Just because one manages to get married, doesn't mean that they stay married.
I am sorry, but I don't think all white women are stepford wives, and I do think it is odd you think women need to stick by their men so they can get a house and car. Black women never had the luxury of sticking by men, and we learned to obtain a car and house on our own, like many white women have.
Black women statistically are expected to marry men who are less educated and with less income than them, not more, white collar or blue collar. So that what you stated is not true. I went to college with many a white girls whose major goal was getting a Mrs. degree. I know many gold diggers of ALL hues.
As a black woman I can say I am not desperate. I am in a healthy, loving relationship. I know many black women like this. We are not all desperate. The marriage rates of black men and black women are not vastly different like you want to believe. 41% of black men and 43% of black women have never been married. Some black women do build up black men, but some black men don't like yourself don't want black women, and see what you want to see.
Newsflash, black women wash and douche. Some of us know how to cook, and some of us know what to do with a man, but sometimes we waste that knowledge on men not deserving of us. Men like you.
I will inform my husband he no longer loves me because he as a white man has had 400 years of me. I will also note that the biggest benefactor of welfare is WHITE women, not black women. I know lots of overly dressed people of all races working in high rises who are single.
All in all, it seems your comment was the typical lashing out at the thing you claim you want nothing to do with. I realize white men are not saviors, and that good men come in every race, why have you not figured that out? White women are not the answer to every black man's prayers.
Thank you,
Siditty

Siditty,
That anon's comment didn't even deserve a response from you. Great post none the less.
I hope nobody out there is listening to assholes like this as it pertains to anything, but especially not to personal hygiene. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ. As long as you take regular baths, douching does more harm than good. And learn how to spell, motherfucker.
Siditty,
Congrats on the baby!! When did you find out?
I'm amazed that people find enough words to say such crap. Just sad.
I must say, this comment by anonymous isn't new to me...I've heard it all...while reading it, I had my violin playing in my head. With that being said, I have no need to entertain him, for ignorance isn't worthy.
BTW, are you expecting Siditty? If so, CONGRATS!! (I'm piggybacking from the other comment)
Roslyn,
Your comment is hilarious!
Ok, I see that I'm slow, for I should have read your new title "Knocked Up Since 2008." Once again, congrats and may you have a healthy pregnancy, birth, and baby :)
When are men going to realize the issues is THEM.
What a sad and pathetic troll. That angry little boy must have been burnt badly be the Black woman who he still so obviously wants. That post actually made me laugh.
Yes, congrats to you and your husband. What a great way to start the new year off.
Just like a disgruntled, self hating Black man.... SMH. He may think a white woman being a "silent partner" is the answer to a Black man's prayers, but what happens when that gets old? And it also goes to show you how ignorant this fool really is. He's gonna blurt out that Black women are good for receiving a welfare check. He REALLY needs to check out the real stats on the black to white ratio of welfare recipients. I'm sick of these super dumb and ignorant Black men who think that white women are their savior from being real men. Typical.
Just another loser with his pointless mindless comments.
Congratulations Siditty on the upcoming bambino.
Zomg! A SiBaby!! Congrats.

As for that anonymous comment someone was so "nice" to leave you, it sounds like the crap I'd get from black men who didn't want to look my way........until a white guy was watching or with me.
"Sparks fly between us black men and white women but black women white men battery been ran out!!! "
Here's hoping one of those sparks flies off and activates the spell check function for him next time. Clippy is there to help, not steal your soul.
I think.
First off , no more troll feeding PLEASE. Second, congrats to the bun in the oven!
"The vagina is a self-cleaning organ. As long as you take regular baths, douching does more harm than good. And learn how to spell, motherfucker."
LOL! Roselyn,
Long time.Good to see you about.
That is a Paper man. And if anyone deserves that its a non black woman. I wish all those would actually end up with White women.
"
So true. These men don't even stay with these white women they run to. Also next time you see a celeb BM/WW couple. Notice how uncomfortable the man is. The only person I have seen comfortable in his relationship is Seal. That seems like a genuine relationship. Most of them seem to have a trophism aura. And I think their real intentions catch up with them later on. That is why they split and are too embarrassed to go back to BW so they keep running through non BW. African men have like a 98% failure rate in these relationships.
They better face their short comings as men in this society whether this is a result of racism or themselves. Blaming Black women will only carry on for another few years. Once the population of fatherless biracial kids grows, they will have to face the truth that they are Paper men.
That comment made me laugh...what an idiot...anyways, I too have written a bit on this subject if you care to read:
See, I actually started taking him seriously. I was getting wounded by his words, until I realized all the misspelled words, and then I though "Epic FAIL!". And did he just ask black women to DOUCHE! That is really...odd. Man it must suck to be his wife...
I know you don't know me (reading your blog since early last year) but CONGRATS on the baby!
Man, I'm going to feel like such a dork if you're not pregnant lol.
Siditty, may I request that you never waste a second or a minute on these people ever again? You're expecting, for Goodness's sake. This can't be good for any mother.
I am not ruffled by this comment, really. Then again, I'm neither a BW, BM, WW or WM. People like this run wild and free in the streets, and many times we may not be able to identify them. What they do is beyond my control, so I let nature run its course and I let them do as they please. With the good comes the bad, and eventually, we'll all have what we deserve. I don't feel a need to bash anyone here, I understand there are temptations and/or obligations that are hard for us to cope with. As you have a successful marriage Siditty, I feel you should not have to answer to such people.

It never ceases to amaze me how these "cowards" on the Internet are not man/woman enough to put there name behind their vicious venom. If you are going to have the audacity to spew ignorance, at least be bold with it. Congrats to you and your husband. Just remember, the nausea only lasts for a little while. You may get lucky and never get it.
Not only is his comment extremely self-hating it's also incredibly sexist. Sad.
Really?
Damn... I've dated (done) many women from many races and ethnicities.
But the one's I like best are the
nice,
funny,
smart,
hot,
physically fit,
religious,
....
Race plays no factor in my choices.
What's wrong with this quack? Mommy didn't hug him enough?
P.S.
Congrats on the baby!!
And what is up with these guys and feminine hygiene anyway? Terence Howard and his damned baby wipes. Sorry, there's a reason why the damned things say BABY wipes. Goodness knows what his women are eaten up with, but it says more about his taste than it does the women.
".
after the very first sentence, I stopped reading. it just wasn't worth MY time and energy.
wow that email was crazy, especially the statement about white men having us for 400 years. I don't whether to think this man is mentally insane or an asshole that wrote this as a sick joke. enough about the complaints of black women being too hard to deal with, if this man is for real about what he thinks, then his arguing is proof that black women can't be ignored and he may be targeting some fucked internal issues towards his female counterparts to put himself on a pedestal.
btw loved ur response siddity, very classy
Ignorance is bliss, I suppose!
Congratulations on the baby!!
This fool is coming straight out of a comic book. If White women know how to keep a man, then why do the US Census Bureau statistics report that more white women have been divorced than non-White women? Total US female divorce statistics as of 2001:
-White: 24.2%
-White (non-Hispanic): 25.4%
-Black: 20.1%
-Hispanic (of any race): 15.9%
-Asian: 10.4%
*()*
@Anon 8:10am- That doesn't disprove anything. If there are more white females on welfare than blacks females, then white females are benefiting from the program more....
Congratulations on the baby!
Re: Douching. What this idiot wouldn't know.
A 1995 survey quoted in the University of Rochester study found that 27 percent of U.S. women age 15 to 44 douched regularly, but that douching was more common among African-American women (over 50%) than among white women (21%).
Thanks Mr. Noface :)

I used to hate that, why all the sudden am I so desirable after a white man starts looking at me. That tells me about the mindset of some of these men. Their self esteem and self hatred is so low, that the only way you can be deemed attractive by them, is if a white man deems you so.

Numbers wise, more white women are on welfare than black woman. How is that false? I think you really want to believe Good Times and BET is an accurate reflection of African Americans.
P.S. I have never been on welfare, and I have known way more black women who have never been on welfare vs. those who are on welfare, but we must all be magical negros.

Grata,
Stop using facts. Not to mention if that man hangs out with woman with stinky coochies, that is on him, not anyone else.

On the Baby for Rhonda, Beautifully Conjured Up, Kristin, simone, digitalcoyote, Orchid, Funkystarkitty, Boom, (fŭng'kē) [blak] [chik], Austingirl:
I found out about three weeks ago. I am nine weeks along, and thank you guys for all the congrats :)...
Anon,
This is my opinion, and my opinion only. Yes it is socially acceptable to date a dark skinned indian woman over a black woman in America. Even if the woman is darker than most african americans, she still isn't black. I have known countless whites mention they are ok with IR relationships with asians, hispanics, and other races, but they can't cross the line of black, no matter what, and it is due to negative stereotypes. Black on the totem pole is still the lowest of the low, even if it is lighter than those of other races. I remember once a girl at my school cried in middle school because a white guy joked she was darker than me. He thought it was funny that black people were called black, when most are brown, and decided to use her skin coloring as an example. He didn't say it as a negative, but the concept of being dark was such a hard thing for her to deal with.
I do think most of the time when white guys think asian, they think east asian though. In the racial hierarchy, a east asian would be more acceptable than an indian girl.
what i'm about to say, i've said on at least 5 other blogs in the last few weeks: i'm so glad i don't live in the states anymore!! there is nowhere in the world--in all of the rest of the world, trust me- where an indian/asian woman, any indian/asian woman just by virtue of being indian/asian, is 'higher up' on ANY hierarchy than a black american woman. in the rest of the world, other determiners rule, like nationality, language, education. of course, ideally, there'd be no pecking order at all, but if i have to choose . . .
I would like to say a big congrats to Siditty on her pregnancy. I have been a fan of your blog for the past year and a bit, although I'm in London.
I have post a few comments about the lack of WM/BW relationships in London and I'm hearing more BW in the UK making a point that WM are not interest in dating BW in London. I don't know about the rest of the UK, I have heard that WM in Manchester and other Northern cities are more open to dating BW but in London it very rare for a WM to approach a BW or to see many BW/WM couples.I don't know why this is?I wish someone would find out!!
Another fact that comes in to play is how BW are not seen as 'hot' in the mainstream media and some BW are argue that this puts us at disadvantage in the dating arena.
Siditty Congratulations on your pregnancy. One of the reasons, why I am so glad that I believe in God, because I find Anon's comments hiliarous and in due course Jesus will him out. Once again God bless on your pregnancy.
This post was too funny! This guy is a jerk/loser. It is pointless, senseless...I wish that people like him wore ID tags in public so that the normal people are forewarned. LOL
Congratulations on the pregnancy!
I rarely ever use the N word but I will today:
Nigga please... For REAL.
I can't even waste my time on responding to this shit. This stupid bastard needs to drink hot bleach...
How many times do I have to explain this to you?.
The fact of the matter is the biggest benefactor of welfare in sheer numbers is WHITE WOMEN, that isn't false. You said it was false. It isn't false, and you seem upset that I don't think that most black women live on welfare.
White people like to think black people commit crimes against whites in record numbers . They never want to take into consideration those who commit crimes have a better chance at getting a white victim versus a black victim based upon sheer numbers, they just like to believe blacks are criminals.
Congrats Sid!!!!
LOL! Seattle Slim, I love you....you are hilarious.
Nigs like him are the reason I've never dated black. They seem to be the majority of black males. YUCK. Those white chicks whose virtues he extols can sooooo totally have his dumbass.
Please delete future crazy posts like this joker.
How nice about the bambino! Congrats!
Badblackckitty,
WORD!
Wow this guy could not even s-p-e-l-l. It is a waste of space. He sounds like he didn't make it past 3rd grade but geez my vocabulary was way better than that! No wonder he's a laborer - if he even has a job.
Congrats Siditty on the baby. That guy is really angry, wow! This is really sad that he would feel that way, but who cares. I believe in krama and eventually it will come back to bite him and others like him.
Also next time you see a celeb BM/WW couple. Notice how uncomfortable the man is.
---------------------------------
Also the next time you see a celebrity BM/WW couple, notice how long they stay together and notice what she brings to the relationship table and what she takes from the table when she leaves. Usually she brings nothing to the table because she is not a professional(although there are some exceptions).She usually stays with him for about 5 to 6 years (sometime it could be a bit longer) and when she leaves she takes half of his net worth or more. She can do one hell of an acting job to get what she wants (which is his money)but he is too stupid to realize it. All I have to say to her is get paid(you go girl, 5 to 6 years of misery just to be rich for a life time with money that you did not have to work for because you never attended college and you met a rich sucker who was dumb enough to marry you and not sign or read the prenuptual agreement).
Great response hit all the key points and factors.
I'm not shocked its very nice to meet another strong, intelligent, well rounded black woman.
These guys are so damaged many will cling to white women even when called the N word by them. What they are really afraid of is black women becoming too comfortable doing without them and indifference is settling in. They imagine everyone is desperate for them in the hopes of getting attention. Isn't it funny how black women are taught to marry down, but black men should seek someone on their level...which doesn't include black women. They'll do and say anything to justify the fact that they tend to take their cues from white men. Many are now extolling Asian women when they want to cut down white women. It's best just not to focus on black men or what they think.
Anon said: "Also the next time you see a celebrity BM/WW couple, notice how long they stay together and notice what she brings to the relationship table and what she takes from the table when she leaves." THINK Michael Strahan, Lou Rawls, Glen Rice, Amani Toomer...the list goes on and on. As the number of black men decline in sports...so goes the women. I'm afraid many of them will soon think black women are now suitable for them once they are down on their luck. Hope they live and remain with ww to be honest.

Despite some intransigence in Washington, Tom Stricker of Toyota Motor North America believes improving fuel economy is a bipartisan issue.
“There is a broad national consensus across parties, generations, certainly in the industry to move forward; and making progress on fuel economy is vitally important,” said Stricker.
Automakers noted that broad support for fuel economy allows them to focus on improvements that will go beyond helping the environment by helping them be more competitive.
“Regulations have spurred innovation,” said Robert Bienenfeld, senior environment and energy strategy manager of the American Honda Motor Corporation, referring to the industry-wide embrace of carbon-reducing standards to meet the challenge of higher fuel efficiency and matching consumer demand for more efficient vehicles. Fuel economy is already rated as the most important factor for consumers shopping for a new car. That demand is integral to studies noting that President Obama’s fuel efficiency standards will help create more than 500,000 new jobs by 2030.
Still, the recently finalized fuel efficiency standards are on track to reduce carbon pollution by 6 billion metric tons and cut our country's oil consumption by 12 billion barrels, according to panelist and Assistant Administrator at the EPA Office of Air and Radiation Gina McCarthy. Thanks to hybrid electric and electric-powered vehicles, we could see even greater reductions in emissions and oil use.
Beyond that, consumers are driving an organic change in transportation behavior by simply driving less. The Information Handling Services lowered the forecast for automobile purchases for 2014 as the growing popularity of car sharing programs, well-planned communities, and public transportation systems means fewer cars are on the road - and less carbon pollution is in the air.

3 Ways to Light Up Your Bike
When it comes to riding a bike at night, who wouldn't feel safer within the laser-light glow of a virtual bike lane? The LightLane (pictured) is a concept design by Alex Tee and Evan Gant, so until this nifty invention is mass-produced, we've rounded up three ways to light up your bike.
Sleek: The new Moof bike incorporates lighting in its design. Two solar-powered lights are built into the aluminum frame.
Stylin': Reminiscent of the neon lights found on lowrider cars, the tubular Down Low Glow helps keep autos at a distance by providing the illusion of a wider bike.
Solar: Low on dough? Follow these instructions to make your own solar-powered bike light.

one this week. Still playing catch up with the mountain of books I already had!
I spied The Rook on Goodreads. It sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.
What did you get this week?
Good luck catching up with the rest of your reading and I hope you enjoy The Rook!
You will have to tell me if you enjoy this book. It sounds very interesting and I can't decided if I should give it a try. Enjoy!

Normally choosing a meal with our family is a very problematic event where everyone wants something different. The only time that this doesn’t apply is on mother’s day, father’s day and birthdays where the other family members be quiet and let the special person choose their location.
So being mother’s day it was up to my mum to decide where to go, pretty much straight away she chose the Subiaco Hotel a place that she has been to many times before. The Subiaco hotel is one of those places that has been there forever and is a Perth institution. Sarah has been multiple times and she has said every time that I would love it. So I had quite high expectations of this restaurant and I was wondering if they would be met.
Walking in on a brisk Sunday night we were instantly warmed up once we felt the warm atmosphere inside the restaurant. Everyone is drinking and laughing and enjoying life, it’s a vast contrast to some restaurants where people just sit down indifferently to their food. The interior is another thing that I have to talk about, it looks fantastic with Perspex light features hanging from the roof, and then there is a little smoker’s room at the back with ivy that reaches all the way from the floor to the roof. It’s benevolent without feeling stuffy.
Once we were handed the menu by the very attentive staff I knew that I was in for a good meal. The menu features a lot of menu options with only 4 or 5 ingredients but all those ingredients are great quality and combined in really interesting ways. There were so many things that sounded delicious! However browsing through the menu one thing caught my eye.
So we ordered an entrée of garlic bread to share. Now I had garlic bread the previous night for dinner at Lancelin and the difference between the garlic bread there and here was night and day. This was a few pieces of delicious sourdough bread that had been sliced thinly then rubbed with fresh garlic and butter then grilled. Absolutely fantastic! $9 9/10
We also ordered a side to go with our meals, I insisted on having this as it had two of my favourite words in there ‘duck fat’. These were brussel sprouts that had been blanched and then they were sautéed in duck fat and they were absolutely fantastic, they had a nice Smokey flavour and then the leaves of the sprouts soaked up the fat. I could eat 100 of these. $8 9/10
Before I mentioned that one thing caught my eye and that made me order it, it was ‘poached egg’. I pretty much love anything with a poached egg on it!! This was angel hair pasta that had WA grown shrimp and it was another great meal! So many things were great, I loved the fact that they actually weren’t afraid to mix herbs through their pasta, I loved the how sweet and fresh tasting the shrimp were, I loved the richness of the egg (which judging by the colour of the yolk wasn’t your standard supermarket egg) coated all the pasta. It might overtake spaghi as having the best pasta dish in Perth! $29 10/10
Mummy had parpadelle pasta with slow cooked lamb shoulder and spinach. Her review of that was “The sauce was beautiful, the lamb was very tender and the pasta was cooked perfectly. A very satisfying dish“ 8/10 $34
According to Sarah they always have pork belly and scallops on the menu and just change what accompanies it. The pork belly and scallops with ho fun noodles. Her review of that was “The pork belly was crispy and melt in your mouth, the scallops were perfectly cooked, the noodle cake was delicious and a novel idea but a touch bland“ 7.5/10 $34.50
I really enjoyed my meal at the Subiaco hotel; it just has food that is really tasty in a friendly atmosphere. I can see why Sarah was trying to get me to go there for so long now. Another thing I wanted to mention was how good value for money it was, considering the quality of the food I thought that it was great value for money. I have paid more at soulless places like sizzler and had worse food!Subiaco Hotel 465 Hay St Perth, 6008 (08) 9381 3069
Sizzler’s Sizzler’s you think you had better than Sizzler’s!!!! I bet they at the Subiaco Hotel do not throw in a single salad, less still a whole bar of them in the cost of your meal for that matter do they. Hater, Hater, Hater, Shameful.
Agreed, Sizzler is a hole.. why pay the amount that you do for old/frozen/no love food when you can walk through the city, northbridge, mt lawley, leederville, subi (my list could go forever) and find a bargain with great fresh food and a much better atmosphere!
I agree! Well i think part of my little sizzler rant was also due to the fact that i don’t really like buffet places as a whole.

It is already a matter of tradition, that after each verbal shenanigan perpetrated by the Rabbi, some minion of his comes out with a benign interpretation. This time we may need a similar assistance, but from the translator of this article:
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef on Saturday welcomed Aryeh Deri back to Shas, saying that this past week, during which Deri, Eli Yishai and Ariel Atias agreed to share leadership of the party, has been "a blessing.""Triple bond"? Could it possibly be "threesome"? Or, maybe, "trifle bond"?
"We have a triple bond that won't be severed soon," Yosef said in his weekly lesson, dubbing all three politicians "rabbis."
Just asking.

Not the Big Three, but the threes
Posted by Ricky - Sixers4guidos on December 6, 2007
That’s what gave the f’n Celtics a 103-113 win at the Wachovia center, and made our record slide at 5-13 (.278).
Sixers played a heck of a game for 40 minutes. Unfortunately games last more. Same old story. These guys always play hard, give 100% on the court, but their flaws in a 48 minutes games are exposed sooner or later. This time it was our porous perimeter defense again (10-22 from three point land for Boston) and some unexpected exploits by Celtics’ role players that we couldn’t guard.
It sucks containing the Big Three to a “standard” night and getting burned by the Eddie Houses, the Tony Allens and the James Poseys of this league. Not to take anything from them, they are very good players, and they showed it. And I’ve always been a big fan of Posey (well, I was…). It’s just that you don’t think you can lose a game because of them when you have to face Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce.
But this is what happens with a team with three proven all stars. They just play their standard basketball on a daily basis, and they open up spots for the others: it’s reserves’ job, then, to take advantage of the chances they are given. They did it versus the Sixers. Whatever…
The first game with Ed Stefanski as GM, after Billy King was fired, started with a wonderful surprise: Sixers wearing some damn cool retro uniforms (in the picture). Jeez, I love those. While we are “re-examinating everything, from the top to the bottom”, can we please sack also the current lame jerseys (especially the black ones), fire the modern logo (LOL) and go back to the old style unis, with our storied 76ers logo?
Ed, please. Please. And bring back the red uniforms, full time. Red is the colour of this franchise. What has black to do with the Sixers? Nothing. It was a (dumb) marketing trick that came up during the beginning of the hip hop era, likely to please young fans and try to sell more stuff. Ok, since that era is over – and since nobody is buying Sixers unis anyway… - can we go back to red now?
The retro uniforms gave us a spark in a pretty unbelievable first quarter, when Sixers shot 73% (14/19) and ended it with a 32-26 lead. Miller abused Rondo (6/7, 13 p), Iguodala was on fire too (5/5, 11 p). Celtics kept the game close thanks to 57% shooting (12/21).
In the second the margin was extended to 11 points, 42-31, on a three point play by a very effective Dalembert. “Celtics’ defense is two steps behind its usual standard” said Boston broadcasters. True. Add that to a terrific start by every single Sixer and you have an idea of what happened.
Miller continued embarassing Rajon Rondo in every possible way (and Rondo is known as a very good defender), and Sixers mantained a 11 point lead: it was 55-44 and 57-46, when Iggy beated the shot clock. Pierce and Garnett made some tough shots in the final minutes and at the half time the score was 57-52.
At the break, Sixers stats were impressive: 60% FG (24/40), 7/11 FT, 19 rebounds (Celtics had 11), 12 assists (vs 11), “only” 6 turnovers. Miller had already 19 (8/11) + 5 rebounds + 6 assists (!!!), Iguodala 14 (6/7), Dalembert 9 (3/3), Lou Williams 7 (3/4). Wow ! Celtics weren’t bad either: 51% FG (21/41), 3/8 from three point land, 7/9 FT: Garnett had 12 on 5/8, Perkins 8 (4/5 … he even looked like a player), Pierce 6 (3/5), Ray Allen 7 but with 2/7.
The problem was that, even with those stellar numbers (that meant also our season high for points in the first half), our lead was only 5 points, not exactly comfortable when you are playing such a good, experienced, deep team.
So it was hardly a surprise when Celtics completed a 13-0 run, including the end of the second quarter, to take a 57-59 lead at the beginning of the third. Boston started playing some tough defense, putting some pressure on us and knocking down some really tough shots. But proud Sixers replied and the two teams made it a nice game to watch, with many lead changes and spectacular plays.
Lou Williams showed all his talent again, scoring and feeding his team mates. A couple of threes by James Posey helped C’s take a 77-81 lead and the quarter ended 80-83 with Rondo going coast to coast to beat the buzzer.
In the fourth Cheeks decided to go small, putting Korver in with Iguodala, Miller, Lou Williams and Sam as our only big man. The move paid off at the beginning (Sixers were up 86-83), but after it started raining… It was a rain of threes: Eddie House had two, Posey another one to put Boston ahead (88-92).
Then Paul Pierce went to work, dishing out a lot of assists (he ended up with an amazing 12), the last two to Posey for this fourth, long three and to House for another jumper: 94-105 with 2.48 left, game over.
Not a bad game for us, but count it as another loss. Miller’s best night of the season, Iguodala’s, Williams’, Dalembert’s solid contributions weren’t enough. The 8 men rotation that Cheeks went with didn’t help, in my opinion: guys were tired in the second half. Iguodala played 46 minutes, and he also had to guard Pierce, Miller 42. Jason Smith, our 8th man, only 11.
As for Boston, seems that all is going in the Celtics way: the three all stars are playing great, it’s clear they love to play together, they don’t care about individual stats, and it’s also evident that it was easy for them to find chemistry. The key to me, barring injuries of course, is how their role players can keep the pace. Right now, they are doing great and even stepping up, and this – unfortunately for all of us, Celtics haters – helps building confidence.
If scrubs (I confirm: scrubs) such as Rondo and Perkins can bring something to the table every night, then Celtics will be scaring until the end, and, contrary to my predictions, can have a shot to the Finals. Posey, Tony Allen and House are on another level to me, especially the former Heat who is a great, versatile player.
They anyway were simply too much for the young, rebuilding, tired Sixers. Retro uniforms are cool but they don’t make miracles happen. At least so far.
Boston throws its usual three point party « Sixers 4 guidos said
[...] Here is the story of another early lead that turns into a loss (remember the Bulls game), and of another, merciless three point barrage (remember the three Raptors games, or also the first one vs Boston). [...]

I did a guest blog post for Girlfriendology last week about the ways we can help our friends improve their body image. Because friends don’t let friends hate their bodies! You can check out the article here. There’s lots of good ideas there. Go forth and read it and come back. I’ll wait.
One question that arose out of the article was “how can I help my friend if I’m not loving my body myself?” And “who am I to promote positive body image when my own self-esteem isn’t where I’d like it to be?”
These questions make sense. We all look for inspiration. Someone stronger and more secure than us that we can look up and aspire towards. Role models. Leaders.
I’ve wondered about this myself. Because while I’ve been complimented on the “work”?
I don’t think so. Because I keep working hard and pushing my way through the bouts of insecurity and faltering self-love. All we can all do is try our best. Be honest and not give up. Try to say and do something that will mean something to ourselves and the people around us.
When you think about it, what’s the alternative? Wait until we feel like we have it completely together? Put off speaking out and working towards a good cause? How do we know when we are “confident enough”?
To me, waiting until we feel like we have our brains perfectly straight is eerily analogous to waiting to accept ourselves until we lose those last ten pounds, or get into those pair of jeans we have tucked away. It’s not realizing our worth NOW.
You can make a difference to someone else’s self-esteem. You can speak out against negative messages hampering women’s positive body image. You have a voice. Use it. Don’t wait until you feel you’ve “earned” the right to speak. You have something to say. Demand to be heard.
There are so people that are just awesome, that make me want to be more . At the same time, their greatness doesn’t make me worth less. When you see someone you admire, try to learn from them. But at the same time, try to find in the leader in yourself.
Empowering yourself will not only help those around you, but will help you to appreciate yourself. Be there for your girlfriends. Be there for yourself. You’re “enough” already.

Mama, Happy Mother's Day!
the photo were taken on the last weekend when me and my sister spending our time with our beloved mom. the location was at the nice indoor garden of the One Utama. it was a very lovely moment when i got the chance to bring her to our hang-out place and trying my fav, the cheesy meat rice! hehe..
so, HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY to my only mama, Puan Zaitun Binti Kasim. she is looking like a middle of 40 something lady, right? well, to be exact she was already 55 years old on the last February! haaarr..so awet muda kan?! so, please know that i'm inheriting those quality from her! LOL haha..
so, here is my short and sweet speech for the responsible person who brought me to this world!
mama, terima kasih memang la tak cukup untuk menghargai kesusahan mengandungkan adik and lebih2 lagi menahan sakit melahirkan adik. adik tau itu satu pengorbanan yang besar dan tak mampu untuk dibalas sampai bila2. adik minta maaf diatas semua kesalahan dan kedegilan yang adik lakukan walaupun adik tau kedegilan itu akan sentiasa berlaku! huhu...insyAllah, adik akan bawa mama jalan2 once i've enough money for it coz itu je yang mampu adik lakukan for both of us. please pray for it..amin. and please know that takde anak yang tak sayang mak die..
btw guys, isn't the photos are looking different to you? yup, i've just successfully edited it after being so envy with other blogger's 'bokeh' photo for a loooong time. so, i was trying so hard google-ing the photoshop tutorial of it. in the end, i found that IT IS SERIOUSLY A VERY SIMPLE METHOD. you just need to 'mix' your photo and any bokeh image together. then, do some adjusting on it, ta-da you've done! seriously, i felt so stupid because i thought that there is a very complicated one! XP
till then..
p/s: " sorry guys, i've unintentionally 'deleted' your comments on this post. haiyooo..i'm sorry and thanks for the words! (">.<) "

However, there has been an increase in vacation housing rental scams, so you need to be careful. Skiers are arriving at the property they thought they had rented only to discover that it's not available for rent or may not even be real. The "property manager" may actually be a scammer who preys on unsuspecting vacationers.
If it happens to you, it obviously puts a huge damper on your vacation. You've given a deposit or even the full rental amount, which is required in many resort areas. You probably won't be able to get back your money if you wired it, and you have nowhere to stay. If you're a victim of a condo or vacation home rental fraud scheme, you're in trouble.
Unfortunately, the local police department in the ski town you're visiting probably won't be able to help you get a refund because the money is typically wired or transferred out-of-state. You'll need to report it to agencies at home or where the money was sent. However, the local chamber of commerce may be able to help you secure new lodging on short notice.
Types of Vacation Rental Scams
Scammers take advantage of vacationers in a variety of ways. The property you are renting may not even exist, or it could be a real vacation rental that has been hijacked by a scammer. The scammer copies photos and a description from a real listing and then relists it with his or her contact information. The most prevalent scams include:
- Fake Condo or House: Rental Property does not exist (fake photos and address).
- Real Condo or House / Fake Listing: The scammer copies a listing from a legitimate rental and posts it online using the photos and description from the real listing, but changes the price and the contact information.
In both cases, the scammer will request payment of the security deposit and the rent (which can be required up to 30 days in advance during peak season) in advance. You will be asked to pay via a wire transfer, money order, Cashier's Check, or other money transfer service. With all these payment methods, it will be as though you paid cash, and it will most likely be impossible to recoup the money you have sent.
Booking Safe Vacation Rentals
How can you book a vacation rental where you don't have to worry about whether you are going to get scammed? Before you make a reservation, it's important to carefully check out the property you are planning to rent and whom you are renting it from. Avoiding a scam upfront will ensure that you are spending your time on the slopes, not trying to find accommodations on short notice.
Scams are more prevalent on vacation rental by owner sites and Craigslist, when you are dealing with individuals rather than an organization. If you book your lodging through the ski resort central reservations, a reputable property management company, or the local chamber of commerce you can be assured that your booking is legitimate.
For example, the Park City, Utah Chamber of Commerce has a directory of lodging providers and you can book directly through the chamber's website. Vail provides one-stop shopping for hotels, vacation rentals, and more local lodging options. Most major ski resorts offer similar services to skiers planning a vacation trip.
How to Avoid Scams
How can you avoid scams? It's important to careful research the lodging and the person you are renting it from. Here are some tips for avoiding vacation rental scams.
Book Direct. Your best bet is to book through a property management company, the ski resort or lodging providers recommended by the resort, or the chamber of commerce.
Check the Price. Is the rental price similar to equivalent listings? If the price is a real bargain, it may be too good to be true. For example, there were scams reported in Park City, Utah during the Sundance Film Festival when vacation housing prices are at a premium. The Park Record reported scams where the price was well below the going rate for housing.
Check the Photos. Check out the photos included in the listing. If you're seeing a photo of a condo with the beach in the background, it's not a condo at a ski resort. Are you seeing the same photos in a variety of listings? That's another sign that the listing may not be legitimate.
Check the Listing. Is the same property listed on many different websites at different prices? That's a sign it could be a scam. The easiest way to check is to take part of the description and search for it on Google. If you see the same property listed with different prices and different contact people, be careful.
Before You Book. Before you submit payment to an individual owner or property manager, call the telephone number in the listing and have a conversation. Ask them for references and contact the references to be sure they were satisfied with their stay. Ask about the terms and be sure you can pay by credit card.
Check Out Who's Renting the Property. If you do book through an individual call them and check them out online. Google them to see what information you can find, check them out on social networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, and search for the name they have given plus the terms "scam" or "fraud" to see if you can find any reports of scams.
Don't Send Money. The best way to pay is by credit card because you can dispute fraudulent charges. Don't pay by money transfer systems like Western Union or MoneyGram or wire money to someone's bank account. If you book through a vacation rental website, book through the site's reservation system. For example, payments made through HomeAway Reservation Manager system are guaranteed up to $10,000 against internet fraud.

I've had this board for over a year and used it no more than a dozen times. I bought this board new from the Vic factory in Laguna but I got an Exile shortly afterwards.
It's a medium polyvac with carbon fiber. Comes complete with pads. This board has no wear except for one minor ding on the nose which I repaired. Take a look at the pictures below. There is no wear on the bottom tail indicating this has barely been ridden. I'm looking to sell this board for $250 (Brand new a carbon poly is 414 w/o pads).

I'd like to take a moment to introduce something a bit different than our usual world of visual skull creativity here on Skull-A-Day. Poet Kim Roberts just shared this piece with me and gave me permission to pass it along to you. It appears in her Pearl Poetry Prize winning book Animal Magnetism...

THE SKULL OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM (1776-1832)
The Warren Anatomical Museum, Harvard University, Boston
Spurzheim’s skull
is sliced through the brow,
completely around,
a perfect cap, then bisected
down the middle.
If you put hinges on either side,
above where he once had ears,
you could open him up
like a treasure box.
Spurzheim made a study of brains,
an atlas of 36 “organs”
(Amativeness, Veneration, Marvellousness)
which controlled morality and intellect.
His brain, one of the heaviest
ever recorded,
would have been a source of pride
if he only had known.
He got so much wrong.
Tell me: is a life wrestling
with a single misguided theory
a wasted life?
The brain is indeed
a treasure box:
a little space here for perception,
an area there for volition,
a communications center,
a music box
with gears and flywheels,
a pirouetting ballerina.
The skull is a beautiful receptacle
and Spurzheim’s skull,
held upright
on a pronged stand,
shelved behind a plate of glass,
a slice of history,
glows.
Folks in the DC area can actually meet Kim at her book release party

With only the official ratification of the CBA standing in the way of NHL hockey, here’s a look at the top 10 unrestricted free agents available when training camps are expected to open Sunday.
1. Petr Sykora. The 36-year-old forward showed up at camp last year with the New Jersey Devils, earned a contract and became a contributing member of a team that went to the Stanley Cup final. He played all 82 games and scored 21 goals.
2. Jason Arnott. The 38-year-old had 34 points for the St. Louis Blues last year. He’s a good depth player for a team looking for a veteran presence.

Ask Rod: Who Is This Guy?
Rod Kurtz, the executive editor of AOL Small Business, is here to answer your business questions. Just send him a video or e-mail at askrod@aol.com.
Rod, many business givers feel their money (large or small) pale compared to the Gates’ and Clintons’ foundations to Africa. But there’s an easy way to give without “giving until it hurts”. If a business donates a percentage of each product sold to their charity, the increments over a period of time, can make an impact.
DARE-America is the anti-drug and anti-violence prevention in our schools. We understand our role behind imperiled children with cancer at St. Jude, the Pediatric Aids Foundation, the displaced children in Haiti and Louisiana, only to name a few tragedies. But that does not make us any less important, because children can be at-risk within their own homes and communities when drugs and crime are present.
To keep our vital charity afloat during these trying economic times, we introduced PRODUCT donations. With one large worldwide organization, DARE receives $1 of each product sold; with another business, we receive 20% of product sold.
So, could you please explain to the small business owner and corporate America who need write-offs how easy it is to donate or recycle product to causes or charities of their choice?

The Power of WHO
Today in the U.S. alone, more than 10 million people are desperately looking for work - 2 million more than last year. For those os uf who have jobs, our daily struggle in this economy is to stay relevant and needed.
Bob Beaudine has answers.
Sports Illustrated has called our friend Beaudine the "top front office match-maker in sports" and "the most influential man you have never heard of." He is one of the world's leading executive recruiters in sports, entertainment and business - placing everyone from the commissioner of the NFL to the coaches of many Division I football teams.
In a great new book, The Power of WHO, he offers more than two decades of practical advice to those who need to find a ner career, want a better job, yearn to smash a series record or want a richer life. He shows readers how to creatively use their network. But he warns, it's not networking as you know it. Says he, "You need to throw out everything you have ever heard about networking to find a job. It's crap! It doesn't work!"
Bob told us, "As an executive recruiter, I get thousands of resumes every week and it's disheartening to see a resume come in from people who feel they're going to get their next opportunity when they write, 'Dear Sir,' 'To Whom It May Concern' or 'Dear Recruiter' (which is an oxymoron, he notes). It always confused me that people use a non-relational approach to get something so important they're going to work eight to ten to twelve hours a day for."
Nameless strangers won't help, but our WHO will. They are friends and allies willing to help when we reach out.
Says Beaudine, "Your WHO is your community of friends that's been built up over many years with love and unconditional giving. These friends care about you, they want to help you, they share your core values. They'll come to your aid if you'd ask them. We've been taught inccorectly that friends and business are taboo. So whoa re we supposed to work with? People we don't know and don't trust?"
There's a good chance you know someone right now who has lost their job or is in a vulnerable position at work. "They feel like they've been in a car wreck," relates Beaudine. "There's pain, fear, panic. But who do you call if you've been in a wreck? You don't pull out a business card from you last conference. You call a family member or a friend."
He adds that people who've lost jobs or those in trouble financially tend to go to Monster. com, send out mass e-mails or start cold-calling businesses. Instead, Bob recommends three Rs:
Remember. You're not alone in your situation. Get back to your WHO - those people you knew in your first jobs, in college, at church, in your kids' sports teams. We've got to talk to the people who matter most because friends help us, not acquaintances.
Reach out. You've got to call them and say, "Where have you been? I've missed you?" These people would drop everything to help. But we think because we haven't talked to them in a while that they're going to think we're a user. That's just not true! Ask for their help. Don't be vague about what you're doing; tell them what you need and that you'll help them whenever you can.
Reconnect with Key People. How many people do you really need this year to get that one big deal? Probably just one. But we don't usually have a list in front of us of the people that matter. We live the rest of our lives with lists. When it comes down to talking about people that matter to you, put them on a list.
Then, when you're finally sitting across from someone who wants to hire you, promote you or give you new business, Beaudine says you should remember the four questions they're thinking about as they interview you:
1. Do I know you? They're wondering if they've heard about you or if someone has spoken to them on your behalf. Recommendations are the biggest reason someone gets a job or makes a sale. In fact, 87 percent of jobs are placed from one friendly reference!
2. Do I like you? How long is it before you form an opinion of someone? It's in the first few minutes. Can you create a positive personal relationship if you've never met a person and no one has given you a reference? Not in two minutes.
3. Do you understand my needs? Are you speaking just about yourself, or hav eyou reserached my company, my current situation and have unique solutions just for me?
4. Are you the best for my situation? Do you have the skills-set I need right now?
As Beaudine reminds us, friendships are as vital to our dreams and goals as food and water are to our bodies. True friendships are based on loyalty and mutual regard. There are no strings attached. You help your WHO friends simply because you can.

Corrections & Amplifications
Entrepreneurs and small-business owners often think that incorporating video into their marketing or communication plan -- let alone configuring a website for video -- is costly, complicated and beyond reach. With the launch this week of Vimeo PRO from Vimeo, nothing could be further from the truth.
Online video is expected to account for half of all consumer Internet traffic by the end of next year, according to a recent Cisco report. Further, a Forbes Insights survey from last December showed that nearly 60 percent of those online will watch a video before reading the text on any given webpage -- and they’re more likely to make a purchase.
These findings should prompt businesses of all sizes to see the urgency of matching the growing demand for video-related content with videos of their own.
Enter, Vimeo. The second most popular online video portal behind YouTube, is finally giving small businesses and commercial enterprises overall their chance to get in on the video action. With Vimeo PRO, $199 a year gives businesses a simple and affordable professional video-hosting solution, complete with analytics for gauging return on investment. Each year, users receive 50 gigabytes of storage and 250,000 plays for video embedded on your own website in a player branded with your company’s logo. That’s enough to upload between 700 and 2,000 five-minute videos, depending on the video format you use.
Think you'll need more? It’s $199 for each 50GB increment. You can also buy additional plays in increments of 100,000 for $199.

Pitch your company in 25 minutes or less
DURHAM, Nov 16, 2012 (The News & Observer (Raleigh - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- Jivan Achreja sat at a long marble table inside a boardroom in the American Tobacco complex Thursday waiting to make his next pitch to advance his company.
Story continues below ↓
Achreja, chief information officer for INRFood (pronounced "inner food"), said he wasn't nervous.
"I was lucky to have parents who believe in public speaking," said Achreja, 23, a 2010 UNC-Chapel Hill graduate.
He is pitching INRFood, an app that at its most basic level allows users to scan a food product's bar code for a list of ingredients that are color coded -- green means safe, yellow means moderation, and red means avoid -- to alert the consumer of customizable dietary restrictions that result from allergies, pregnancy and disease.

Many will relate to movable and pop-up books as toys whose primary purpose is to
entertain children and adults. Tunnel books or peep-shows, (accordion books that when extended allow the viewer to see a spatial area in perspective) continue to amuse children of all ages. The exhibition Fold, Pull, Pop & Turn will also include clever flap books that reveal answers to riddles or
show cartoon-like characters when lifted.
Many works, as seen in Cinderella and the Glass Slipper and Ali Baba—retell familiar fairy tales in stage-like settings. The brightly colored figures and animals—illustrating old and new storie—exhibited throughout the show—will entice all viewers.—Elizabeth Periale
That's a wonderful image that is surely accompanying Little Red Riding Hood. I must be showing my age by actually remembering books like that from my own childhood!

Droves of Tattoo aficionados on Long Island will soon descend on Nassau Coliseum for United Ink, the region's only tattoo convention.
"Long Island has many great, talented artists and we need a place to all get together and unite, to tattoo in one place together," said Lou Rubino, owner of the Tattoo Lou's tattoo shop chain and event creator. "That’s why I planned this United Ink, to bring the art of tattooing to a whole new level on Long Island."
The convention, which runs July 27 to July 29 will showcase artists from around the world, Rubino said. There will be roughly 250 booths, about 200 having multiple tattoo artists working. About 20 of the booths will be manned by artists from local shops.
In addition to the tattooing, other booths will consist of piercers, tattoo supply companies, tattoo aftercare companies, clothing companies, companies that insure tattoo shops, tattoo attorneys and more.
There won't be a shortage of notable artists at the convention as it will feature three artists from the tattoo reality show Ink Master – winner Shane O'Neill and show contestants Billi Vegas and Al Fliction, star of the reality show NY Ink Megan Massacre, reality show LA Ink star Amy Nicoletto, Bowery Stan, Philadelphia Eddie, Roman Abrego, Chris Torres and more.
Many artists from the Tattoo Lou's shops will also be tattooing and piercing.
Aside from tattooing, the convention will feature a signing by former New York Yankees great Jim Leyritz, the Coney Island Freak Show, a body suspension act, tattoo seminars, contests for best tattoo of the day and much more.
Following each night of the convention, afterparties will go well into the night at surrounding bars and clubs, and Sunday night will feature an awards ceremony at Aura in East Meadow. Doors open at 9 p.m. and tickets are $15.
"It’s awards given out to not only just famous artists but artists that have made an impact on the industry as a whole, that have changed the way society perceives tattooing," said Mark Perez, director or marketing at Tattoo Lou's.
Rubino said he hopes to host roughly 10,000 people each day of the convention. Tickets are $18.50 for a day pass, $40 for a full weekend pass, and children 12-years-old and younger are free. The tickets could be purchased at the Nassau Coliseum box office and via TicketMaster.
Rubino said this convention isn't about his chain of stores but rather a celebration of the tattoo culture.
"The change over the past 10 years or so has been huge and more and more people are seeing this as an art form," he said. "It’s a great art form and there’s a lot of awesome, talented artists out there that need to be seen."

Mortality is on my mind. Morbid? Perhaps. Because I looked at the news? Perhaps. Because I saw the doctor yesterday? Perhaps.
I should be working. Perhaps, then, I would be relieved of a heavy feeling. I have no reason to feel blue. In fact, if a color was needed to understand my day, it would be gold — or platinum. If a gem — a star sapphire. Yes! I shall get my star sapphire ring and put it on — now.
Ah, the weight of a gem makes me feel better which is downright silly. (Am I watching too much British television? Tonight, we shall watch the final episodes of “Downton Abbey”. The drama — comedy — suspense. I just love it.) I do love looking at how the star of the sapphire can be manipulated in the light. Gracious. René gave it to me to wear. I can’t hide it in a box because I think (keyword: think) I may lose it. Thus, with this ring on my hand, I’ll get to work. What music shall I listen to? I will not decide. I will open the case in which I keep CDs at random and let that decide for me. Surprises are best to alleviate blue moods. Actually, I have gotten myself out of this blueness. I am buoyant. I have a star on my finger. I am happy.

The dauncey feeling I have had for the past couple of days is approaching its apex. I have patched myself up, a bit, by taking cold tablets. I am now drowsy, but not achy — as much. It is odd how one can be blue over bad health. that is not what I meant to say. I shall start again.
It is odd how one ignores ill health by attributing it to a weak mind. One’s mind is strong, however, as I well know, when one’s body is attacked by germs, for lack of a better word at the moment, one tends to forget necessary precautions. Today, with rain outside, I considered that to be the culprit for making me ache — all over. Those two words, “all over” — not just healed bones — should have been the instant key for me to open my mouth to swallow meds that can help. I did. They do work. Fascinating stuff when taking more medicine, drugs, if you will, can help the physical and mental stamina. I have just left the computer. Today was difficult. I had to triple check all I did. The orders kept coming. I think I was, hmm, successful.
I do wish I were successful in writing something of interest. My only success is in the act of writing and not missing a day.
As evening approaches, I think I have a bit of energy to stare at the TV and not much more.

”To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment”—Ralph Waldo Emerson
Here’s how it all began:
As I walked through the 2011 Rhythm and Blues Festival on 18th and Vine District in Kansas City, Missouri, I was tantalized by melodic sounds of jazz, blues, and R&B music infused with hickory wood smoke with sizzling barbecued meats atop. Every display booth spilled over with colorful, vibrant, clothing, jewelry, car detailing, baked goods, and food. But one important element of this glorious day was missing—no customers.
Instantly, my wheels began to click! Why come Kansas City, Missouri does not have a on-line network (community) for small business owners, or better yet, an online business directory? So, with camera in tow, I pitched my elevator speech to attending vendors photographing business profiles through #scocialmedia. I titled the profiles as the EGallery in the next column.

“Bordeaux” Jordan Son of Mars
August 8th, 2012 by John K. | 3 comments
Sometimes it’s minute touches that make a shoe turn out better than expected. Of course with the ‘Bordeaux’ base, you’re already off to a good start, but Jordan Brand decided on punching up this colorway with the hint of minty green on the rubber piece of the outsole. It’s these minor details that cause the “double-take” (the good kind) and end up playing a much larger role, so is this hint of green the right touch for you? Check out the detailed images of this upcoming mid-September release of the Son of Mars below and let us know if these are flown into your radar now that you’ve gotten a better look.

, Teatro Valle Occupato, Rome
Throughout Europe, we are witnessing massive transfers of resources from the public to the private sphere. The political responses to the crises are defined by austerity measures and by cuts to social spending, driving Europe further into recession.
From Greece to Spain, from London to Rome, European people are increasingly aware of the need for a different model of globalisation. From those resisting the privatisation of resources (for example in Italy with the water referendum, and currently in Romania) to the recent occupations of public spaces against neoliberalism (for example in the UK and Spain), this is the moment to construct an alternative Europe which is not a product of neoliberal politics, but the political expression of European citizens.
Within this context, over forty organisations, networks and social movements from eight European countries will meet in the 600-seat Valle Theatre in Rome to organise a common front to construct an alternative European model. This three-day forum will focus on the construction of common transnational campaigns on the thematics of the commons and guaranteed minimum income as well as the battle against precarity, also utilising the new method provided with the European citizens’ initiative. The event will be a true Citizens’ Initiative for a European Charter of the Commons was initiated by the.

At the cliff house, Liam's request took Steffy off-guard. Liam seemed impressed with himself for having done so. Steffy agreed to move in only if she could keep her loft. She didn't want to move too fast, and she thought it was practical to have a place in town in case they needed space or in case they were too tired to drive up to the cliffs one evening. "Let's stay spontaneous and flexible," Steffy decided.
Liam and Steffy cuddled on the sofa, and Steffy said she thoroughly enjoyed living in the moment with no care to the past or future. Recalling that Steffy was into making memories, Liam led her to the bedroom, and they made out on the bed.
In Bill's bedroom, Bill stood naked beside his towel. Brooke's eyes darted around the room as she avoided staring at him, and she explained that she'd been looking for Will's blanket. It was in her hands, so Bill guessed she'd found it.
The two stared at each other, and Bill remarked that any other woman would have run from the room by then -- or at least covered her eyes. Brooke figured that in business, Bill was use to waiting until the other person blinked. "Put your towel on, Stallion," she ordered. He complied, and as she left the room, he said she was one in a million. "You, too," she replied, closing the door.
At Katie's hideout, Taylor warned Katie that Brooke was getting close to Bill and Will, and Katie could lose her family forever. Katie said she could feel her body giving out a little more each day, and she refused to let her son become attached to her. Taylor replied that everyone was dying, but Katie contended that her situation was different. Katie felt that she had a year or less to live, and she said that if God had any compassion, he'd take her at that very moment.
Taylor tried to calm Katie down, but Katie ordered Taylor to get out. Katie also threatened to bolt if she saw anyone resembling Brooke or Bill out on the nearby streets. Taylor reassured Katie that she had Taylor's confidence. Katie screamed at God that she was ready to have a heart attack and die. Taylor said it was the depression talking, but Katie begged God to take her.
At Big Bear, Eric tucked a pillow behind Stephanie's head as she sat on the sofa. Rick called Eric's phone, and Eric answered it at Stephanie's urging. Rick claimed he hated to interrupt Eric and Stephanie; however, he said Thomas intended to put his plans to a vote. Rick feared that, if Thomas got his way, it could cost the company over ten million dollars.
Eric grew grim. He didn't think Thomas' ideas were right for the business, either. Rick asked Eric to return for the vote, but Eric replied that he wasn't in town. Though Rick felt bad about the timing, he said the future of Forrester was at risk. Eric told Rick to try to stall things, and Eric would call back later.
After the call, the frail Stephanie said Eric should be there. Eric, however, refused to leave her. Stephanie knew how much the business still meant to him, even if he'd let "the boys" have charge of it, so she suggested that he call Brooke. "She wants to see me, I know. She'll come," Stephanie decided.
Eric called Brooke, who was still at Bill's house, and said he had to get to Forrester for a vote on Thomas' agenda. Eric explained that he didn't want to leave Stephanie alone, and she'd asked for Brooke. Eric swore Brooke to secrecy about their Big Bear location, and Brooke agreed to go there right away.
When Eric returned to Stephanie in the main room, he found her sleeping with a photo album on her lap. The book was open to pictures of Ridge. Stephanie awakened and hoped that Eric wasn't upset that she'd asked Ridge not to be there. She felt that Ridge was a lot like Eric. Proud to have been Ridge's father, Eric stated that Ridge had been her greatest gift to him. She uttered that she loved Eric, and her words turned into a coughing spurt. "You're okay," the pained Eric sweetly uttered.
Eric went to change into a suit, and Stephanie flashed back to being outside at the party with Brooke, who hadn't understood why Stephanie was going away to die. When Eric returned in his suit, Stephanie said he was the most handsome man in the room. Remarking that he was the only man in the room, Eric said that she was controlling and incorrigible, and he loved it.
Stephanie told Eric not to get sentimental, but Eric persisted in saying what was on his heart. He was tortured that she'd leave him, but he was grateful for "all the pain in the ass" that she had been. He felt grateful to have called her his partner, his wife, and the bane of his existence. They expressed their love for each other and stared tenderly at one another.
Brooke arrived, and on the doorstep, Eric thanked her for being there. He said that Stephanie wasn't good, and Brooke wondered if he really should be leaving at that time. Eric said that it was what Stephanie wanted. "She wants to be with you," he added and promised to return as quickly as he could.
Before he left, Eric awakened Stephanie, who'd nodded off, and he asked her to keep her Irish eyes smiling for him. She kissed him and ordered him to straighten the boys out. Eric left, and wincing in pain, Stephanie said she was glad that Brooke was there. "Me, too," Brooke replied.
In the CEO's office, Pam was surprised to hear that Eric would be there for the meeting. Rick replied that he'd had to take some kind of action to stop Thomas from steamrolling his agenda through. Pam thought it was good that Eric would be there, but she wondered about Stephanie. Rick explained that Brooke would tend to Stephanie. Pam began to cry. "So you know where she is?" Pam asked. Sympathetically, Rick responded that he didn't have any idea.
At Katie's, Katie wanted Taylor to leave so that Katie could die alone. Taylor refused, and Taylor insisted that Katie was not dying. Katie disagreed.
Katie reiterated that she was dying because she felt like her heart was going to explode. Taylor called the hospital and told Katie they were leaving for the hospital. Katie continued to argue. She said that she wanted to die alone. Taylor refused to listen and took Katie to the hospital.
At the hospital, Katie said she wanted to leave, but Dr. Caspary, Dr. Meade, and Taylor got Katie into a hospital bed in a room for evaluation. The medical staff checked Katie's vital signs, and Taylor noted that some of Katie's symptoms were indicative of anxiety. Dr. Caspary and Dr. Meade agreed but said that blood work would quickly indicate if anything was wrong with Katie's heart. The doctors left Katie alone with Taylor.
Katie started freaking out that she wanted to return home. Taylor reminded Katie that home was not the apartment that Katie had rented. Taylor said that home was where Bill and the baby were waiting for Katie. Taylor continually tried to calm Katie, but it didn't work.
Katie clutched her chest and screamed that she had to leave. Dr. Caspary and Dr. Meade returned. Katie pulled off all the monitoring equipment, jumped out of the bed, and said she was leaving. The doctors tried to restrain Katie, but Katie fought and screamed at everyone to leave her alone and stop touching her.
At Forrester, Thomas and Steffy met privately, and Thomas said that he needed Steffy's support to move the company forward. Thomas knew that he would get objections from most of the family. Steffy agreed to support him.
Steffy and Thomas discussed that Steffy had returned to live with Liam. Thomas hoped that she was happy. Steffy said that she and Liam were moving slowly, and Steffy wanted her independence. Steffy wanted to retain her own condo in the city, and Liam would keep the beach house.
Outside the office, Rick, Caroline, and Thorne discussed that Thomas was moving too fast. Rick regretted that he had begged Eric to return to Forrester for the meeting. Thorne and Caroline supported Rick and told him that they needed Eric to talk some sense into Thomas. Thorne entered the office for the meeting, and Caroline told Rick that he had done the right thing when he contacted Eric. They kissed, and Rick thanked her for her support.
Eric showed up outside the office, and he talked to Pam. Eric said that Stephanie was not doing well. Pam tearfully begged Eric to let her go to Stephanie. Eric said that Stephanie had asked for Brooke to stay with her while Eric was gone. Eric said the company needed Pam to stay at the office.
Pam tearfully acknowledged that she would not be much help to Stephanie. Pam said that she wanted to hold Stephanie's hand in her dying moments, but she understood Stephanie's wishes. Eric hugged her.
Eric entered the office where Marcus, Thomas, Thorne, Caroline, and Rick argued about Thomas' plans for the future. Thomas said that the company needed a total overhaul, and Steffy and Marcus agreed that the company had been stuck in the 90s.
Rick reminded Thomas that Thomas was the interim CEO, and it was not his decision to spend millions to go in another direction. Eric interrupted and said that he wanted to make the meeting quick so he could return to Stephanie. Eric added that Thomas had been appointed interim CEO and was to maintain the status quo until Ridge had determined the next move the company would make. Eric reminded Thomas that Eric had been CEO for many years. Eric said it was never a good idea to make impulsive decisions.
Thomas agreed. He told the group that he had researched his ideas and had a business plan that required upfront costs but would pay off in a few years. Thomas noted that Caroline's designs could be the new ideas the company needed.
Eric wondered if Thomas was suggesting some type of voting agenda immediately, and Thomas said that he was prepared to vote his dad's stock and Taylor's stock. Everyone was surprised that Thomas wanted to push his ideas through so quickly without Ridge present.
At Big Bear, Stephanie was in pain. She coughed and used the oxygen. Brooke comforted Stephanie.
Stephanie wanted Brooke to assure her that the family would take care of Eric and keep him involved in decision-making at Forrester. Brooke agreed. Stephanie said that Eric needed to put his energy into the company once Stephanie was gone.
Brooke and Stephanie joked about old times. Brooke said the cabin held many memories. "Quite a journey we've taken," Brooke said. Stephanie asked if she looked as bad as she felt. Brooke told her she looked wonderful. Brooke rubbed some ointment on Stephanie's lips. Stephanie thanked her.
Brooke brushed Stephanie's hair, and Stephanie asked if Brooke had brushed Hope's hair the same way. Stephanie asked if Hope had loved to have her hair combed. Brooke said that Hope had loved it. Brooke left for a moment and returned with a brooch for Stephanie. They both laughed, and Brooke pinned the jewelry on Stephanie's pajamas. Stephanie teased Brooke to be careful because she didn't want Brooke to nick a major artery.
Stephanie had a scary coughing spell where she couldn't catch her breath. Brooke administered some additional medicine under Stephanie's tongue. Stephanie struggled to catch her breath, and Brooke and Stephanie noticed that Stephanie was coughing up blood. Stephanie looked frightened, and Brooke hugged her and told her not to worry.
At the hospital, Katie had been restrained in a bed, and she claimed it was unnecessary. Katie said that her body was nothing but scars, and Bill wouldn't be able to stand looking at her. Katie called attention to her scar from heart surgery and the scar from her C-section.
Taylor took the opportunity to remind Katie that Katie cared very much what Bill thought -- a far cry from what Katie had said. Taylor noted that Katie cared about Bill and Will, and Taylor forced Katie to remember her family. Katie said she had failed at everything she had done, including working with Taylor. Katie ordered that she no longer wanted Taylor involved in her care.
Taylor stepped outside the hospital room and called Bill's home. Donna answered. Donna asked if there was anything she could do to help Katie. Taylor looked thoughtful and later returned to Katie's room. Taylor told Katie that she had once given up a baby and lost her mind.
Taylor reminded Katie that Katie's body had suffered trauma, and in her mind, Katie was caught in a repetitive cycle. Katie cried and said that she had ruined her life. Taylor disagreed. Taylor noted that Katie's family was waiting for her. Katie looked up and saw Donna, who stood outside, carrying the baby.
At Big Bear, Stephanie's health was clearly deteriorating. Brooke read to Stephanie, and Stephanie interrupted to ask where her mother was. As Brooke read a book about a son who had not returned to his home, the book became too real for Brooke, and Brooke became uncomfortable. Brooke said she wanted to choose another book, and Stephanie grabbed her hand. Brooke asked what Stephanie needed, and Stephanie said, "Forgiveness."
Stephanie admitted that she had told Ridge not to return for the party, Stephanie said that she did not want Ridge to see her so sick. Stephanie added that she was the shallow and vain one after accusing Brooke of the same thing for many years. Stephanie said that she had sent the one person whom she had loved most in the world away, and she would never see him again.
Brooke said that it might be for the best because if Ridge had been there, he would have been inconsolable. Instead, Brooke added that Brooke was there for both of them, and there was nothing to forgive on Stephanie's part.
Brooke and Stephanie looked outside and watched a deer grazing on the nearby landscape. Stephanie said that it was time, and Brooke asked if it was time for more medicine, but Stephanie said it was time to go outside.
Brooke argued, but Stephanie insisted that she wanted to feel the sun on her face one more time. Brooke said, "I'm afraid."
"I'll take care of you," Stephanie said.
They ventured outside and sat mesmerized by the beautiful scenery.
At Forrester, Eric said he was losing his way of life and way of living along with his wife. "It's all slipping away," he said.
Eric and Thorne argued that Thomas was moving too fast at changing the company. Eric said that Thomas should put his plan in place at the Rodeo Drive location as a test. If it worked there, they could roll it out elsewhere. The family agreed..

Pasadena-based eHarmony has launched a gay and lesbian web site, Compatible Partners, which the firm says will help gay and lesbian singles to find long-term relationships. The site--which came about as a result of a legal settlement with the state of New Jersey--said it will use questionnaires to match users values, attitudes, personality traits, and interests. eHarmony said that pricing for Compatible Partners will be the same as eHarmony.com. eHarmony said it would launch a same-sex web site back in November of 2008, after reaching a deal with the state of New Jersey to settle charges that the firm was in violation of that state's discrimination laws. The firm had previously refused to accept gay members to its flagship site.

Authenication Fails when trying to login to client via Edge
- Tuesday, July 14, 2009 7:30 PMHello all,
I'm having issues getting OCS working outside of our network. OCS works fine internally but not when a user tries to connect from home. We have an Edge and ISA server setup and all firewall ports that are needed are open.
When a client tries to connect externally they get to the point to enter their password. At that point it will not let the password through. I know the password is correct but it just doesn't work. I traced the packets and the Egde and the client are "talking". Our user does have remote access enabled.
When I try to validate the Edge server I get the below error.
Maximum hops: 2
Failed to register user: User sip:testuser@testdomain @ Server internalpool.testdomain
Failed to send SIP request: outgoing TLS negotiation failed; HRESULT=-2146893022.
All Replies
- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 12:47 PMSo when you say the client and edge are talking can you explain more? usually if all of that is working and the client is hitting the edge correctly they it is a problem with the next hop from the edge server to your internal environment. Are you setup with Dual NIC's on the edge?
Take a look at the event logs on the edge server you may see where it is having cert issues with the internal server or Name resolution problems. Be sure you can telnet from the edge to the next hop server i.e. director or pool. on port 5061.
let us know if that helps.

- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 1:31 PMMitch,
Thanks for the reply!
Sorry for not explaining myself a little better. I'm new to using packet sniffers. What I mean by "talking" is that the external client is sending and receiving packets from the edge server. It starts out with TCP and then changes to TLSv2.
On the Edge server we have 2 NIC's. One NIC is for the internal traffic and the other is external. The external NIC has 3 public non-NAT IP Addresses.
I'm able to successfully telnet 5061 from the Egde to the pool. No issues there.
On the edge server I see the below 2 warings in the event log.
7/15/2009 2:11:50AM OCS Certificate Manager 1016 31007
The CRL could not be downloaded for certificate:.
7/14/2009 2:13:09AM OCS Certificate Manager 1016 31007.
Could this be my problem?
Thanks,
Keith
- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 1:46 PMNo that usually is not the cause of this type of problem. Do you have Gateways for both nics? if so remove the one for the internal nic and be sure you put a route in the route table so the edge can route to your internal IP's also check to make sure that the outside NIC is set to not register in DNS. Then check DNS to make sure it is not regestering in your internal DNS.

Only the External NIC as a default gateway. We make a static route to route the traffic to the internal network. I assume it works because we can ping the internal OCS server with no issues. I checked the to make sure that the external NIC is not registering.
We do have the internal NIC set to register. Should I remove that check mark?
Thanks for your help!
Keith
- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 2:02 PMModeratorReigstering the internal NIC is typically correct, depending on what DENS server you are using and what FQDN you've defined for DNS resolution for the Internal Edge.
Is this a Standard Edition deployment or an Enterprise with an HLB?
Jeff Schertz, PointBridge | MVP | MCITP: Enterprise Messaging | MCTS: OCS
- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 2:03 PMNo you should leave it. So based on the error it says it failed to make a TLS connection this is usually a Certificate issue in most cases. I have seen in some it is a connection issue but often it is a cert issue. Which could be the cert in 3 places basically.
First check you Edge cert for you public side. Does it have a subject name? if so does it match the FQDN that the client is looking for and or connecting to from the outside?
Check the internal nic Certificate to be sure it has a subject name and is trusted by the internal pool front end server. Check the logs on the front end as well for errors.
I usually setup the edge server to pass the FQDN of the server so it is not just passing the host name.
you can do this by going into properties under my computer where you usually add it to the domain and select more then you can add the domain name as a primary DNS suffix even though it is not a memeber of the domain. This way it will pass the FQDN while trying to establish the tls connection with the pool frontend server.

- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 3:37 PMThis is what I have in our test domain.
Internal OCS Server / SQL Server 2005 - Server 2008 X64
External Edge - Server 2008 X64
ISA Server - Server 2003 X32
We did a consolidated FE server using Enterprise edition. Internal OCS works fine at this point. I just checked the FE server and there are no errors or warnings. It almost seems like the edge is not passing traffic through to the FE pool.
- Wednesday, July 15, 2009 3:38 PMMitch,
All the certificates subjects match up with the FQDN's. I'm totally baffled on this one.
Thanks for your help!

Well I would walk it through the basics again. also pull a wireshark trace just to see the connections happening. At the same time start a debug session on the edge and the pool server. check the sip stack for tracing and see if it shows anything at all.

I've tried all the above and nothing seemed to fix my issue. I can successfully do anonymous Live Meetings via the Edge but the MOC will just not authenticate.
We are behind two firewalls but we don't have any control over them. We have to submit a rules request and another agency opens them up for us. We have had them pull logs and we can't find any thing being denied by either of them.
I'm kind of stumped on this one.

MSDN Referral
- Saturday, July 21, 2012 8:02 PM
So I bought MS Office Professional 2010. On the back of the package is a small asterisk followed by "*Licensed for noncommercial use on up to 3 home PCs"
Foolishly, I assumed that I could install it on three noncommercial PCs in my home!
I did not do this all at once, but I first installed it on my desktop computer, which I use for banking, desktop publishing (flyers, etc., for home use). I had surgery in April and to entertain myself I purchased a new laptop computer and I installed it on that one.
My desktop computer has been getting slower and slower, it was quite old, and I didn't know what else to do except replace it. It was time. So I bought a new comptuer two weeks ago and have slowly been moving in-as time allowed. This morning I decided it was time to use my third installation.
This is when the fun started. I ran the installation program but in the end it said I did not have a proper license. I ran the wizard and it gave me the six-digit times nine section number. I ran it through the automated program and it told me my license was only good for two installations. In disagreement, I called the telephone number provided and i got a human autobot in, I believe, India. She ran the same steps that I had just done on the automated portion and stated the same thing. She was INSISTANT that since I bought a 'professional' product that I only get two installations because it's not for home use. I persisted in the conversation and she went and got a supervisor, but did not put them on the line. I could hear (but not understand) the conversation between them, and they both insisted that I only get two installations, although my packaging says I got three. I confused them further when I asked them to assist me in directing me where I needed to go to escalate my concern.
This is where you come in. They told me to call MSDN at 1-800-754-5474. When I called I discovered your office is closed (it's Saturday). So I came to this forum to leave my comments and concernes. I am at a total loss where to go next, and I highly doubt I am even in the right place. All I know is I thought I was buying a three-installation product and I have used it twice. My package says three, Microsoft says I only get two. I didn't know that a private party could not purchase MS Office Professional without being considered a commercial user. If that is so, as Miss India told me, am further confused why the package for MS Office Professional 2010 would state that it was a three-computer installation - unless, of course, it could be installed three times in a business but only two times in a private home?
See why I'm confused? I love MS Publisher. That's the reason I got the Professional version. Otherwise the regular Home version would have been adequate.
Someone, please help me!

May i know from where you purchased MS Office Pro 2010. According to Microsoft Store and Office Store Office Pro 2010 allows only upto 2 PCs single user installation. Please check the below links for more information.

i'm going to have to agree with Pratha's response here. Wherever you bought Office, you're going to have to go back to that source for issues. I dont see how MSDN is involved, or can assist, unless you've purchased an MSDN Subscription, which it doesn't sound like you have. Perhaps the person recommended that you purchase an MSDN Subscription to meet your needs? I dont know why they said what they did.
But: You should try asking your office question over the Office section of. Questions about Office packaging and office capabilities are definitely off topic here.
Since I dont see what this has to do with MSDN, and its a couple of weeks old, I'm going to move this post to off topic. Mrs9838, please feel free to repost here in the MSDN Subscriptions feedback forum with your specific questions about MSDN.

Increase the width of the "Total" Text field automatically in a SSRS/BIDS report?
- Friday, August 31, 2012 9:27 PM
Hi I am designing a sales report using Business Intelligence Development studio. I have a table that shows the sales quote line items - such as product ID, Unit price, Quantity and line total and at the bottom of this table, I display the totals. The totals are displayed in another table just below as shown before.
Now, sometimes, I have larger values - and I want the width of the columns (especially the Totals) to increase automatically to the left (and reducing the adjacent column say "product description" column proportionately such that the total width of the table remains the same). For all columns in the table, I set the "Can Increase to Yes and Can Shrink to No". {should i set Yes to Can Shrink}
I notice that the total column in the report doesn't increase it's width when the numbers are too large and the digits are displayed in the next row!!
The Results display like below
Any help is highly appreciated. Thank you

Hi CRM,
Reporting Service does not allow you to dynamically adjust the width of the textbox, only option you can control is "CanGrow" and "CanShrink" only affect the vertical size.
In order to fix the data in the same cell, you can dynamically adjust the "Font Size" based on the expression passed.(Reduced the Font size if more number of digits present).
Regards
Harsh
- Monday, September 03, 2012 12:49 PMThanks Harsh. I appreciate it. Could you point me some examples of how I can change the font size - is there a sample code i can refer to? or could I be able to configure in the text box property?
- Monday, September 03, 2012 4:33 PM
Hi,
Yes it text box property and press F4 to open the properties window, Under Font you will find the FontSize, set it based on expression.
For Example :FontSize =IIF(<<Value>> < 9999.99, 10, 8) etc
Regards
Harsh

- Tuesday, September 04, 2012 12:33 PM
Hi Harsha, Thanks but I need clarification. the <<value>> refer to the font size or the width of the text box?
Current Settings for the text box (table): 1 inch; Cambria font size 10; the size of the text box is 1 inch.
I could hardcode something like this:
=IIF(len(Fields!totalamountValue)>10,"8Pt","10pt"). But what if, after changing to 8pt, it still exceeds the width of the text box?
Could you elaborate on this? Thank you
- Thursday, September 06, 2012 3:31 AM
Hi,
<<Value>> refers to field value coming from dataset , Your example use the expression prefectly, Since the ssrs does not allow to write expression in width column (Therefore you can't set it dynamically), we can try the other hacks like settting the font size,changing the font or setting the font weight based on the value coming in the field.
Otherwise you have to live with CanGrow and CanShrink options, but it only allow textbox to grow vertically.
Regards
Harsh

British comedian Russell Brand and pop star Katy Perry will tie the knot in a fall ceremony off the coast of Maui this October, celebrity tattles tell The NY Post’s Page Six spies.
The quirky couple have kept the blogosphere guessing about the details surrounding their nups since Russell — an ex-sex addict — propsed to Katy after three months of dating during a trip to India last December. Despite previous rumors placing the weddings in Thailand, India, and Britain, snoops insists this scoop is solid.

…is one of my favorite movies. Not only because I enjoy the yucky love stuff, but also because of THIS scene. I’m sorry, it’s adorable. Any (if not every) girl yearns to feel that to someone else they are the world. That their someone else would be brave and bold and put their heart on the line, and tell her that she’s it. She’s the one.
Regardless of age or time of year, moments like the one in the Love Actually video will always touch my heart. It’s a different feeling from that felt pre-engagement, but still gets to that vulnerable, happy place where little kid dreams live.
But these next videos… awe, man, tears were pouring down my face. This 2011/2012 proposal/engagement season has not been impressive because of the slew of bridal marketing being done, but because of the engagements themselves. Watch and see what you think.
See what I mean? I love ‘em! They get you in that usually-protected, raw, gushy place in your heart.
Props to the proposers. We’re looking forward to stepping up our razzle dazzle wedding planning game not just for the brides but for the ’12-’13 grooms!

When.
The YouTube team announced yesterday that since the new design launched in December, “daily unique visits to channels have increased by 60 percent” and “daily net subscriptions are up 50 percent.” Not too shabby, eh?
Along with this news came the announcement that yesterday the new channel design went live for everyone. If you hadn’t updated your channel yet on your own, YouTube has now done it for you, so don’t be surprised if you head over to your channel today and things are looking a bit different. You’ll have a little bit of setting up to do, as you now have four channel template options to choose from. We’ve put together a helpful guide to help you get set up with your new YouTube channel design.
The YouTube team also pointed out some new features that have been added to the channel design since it was updated in December:
- A Featured tab has been added to let users display feature content more prominently
- Favorites have become more accessible and are now a customizable part of your channel
- You can now link to your +Page or Google+ Profile directly from your YouTube channel
Have you set up your new YouTube channel yet? Have you noticed a boost in channel visits or subscribers since the new design went.

I am trying to force the SDK to use idc_level 30 and I am setting CodecLevel to MFX_LEVEL_AVC_3 in order to do this.
This doesn't seem to have any effect. On the target machine, a recent I5 machine (hardware encoding), an examination of the H.264 stream generated by the SDK shows that idc_level=32.
The reason for wanting level 30 is that Windows Media Player can't play our MP4 files properly on some machines. On machines where Media SDK defaults to idc_level=30, our MP4 files play fine. On machines where Media SDK uses idc_level=32, the file opens but freezes at the first frame. Needless to say, VLC plays the files fine, so this looks like a bug in WMP, but one we would like to work around by forcing idc_level=30.
Any ideas on why CodecLevel is not being honoured by Media SDK?

Take Action on This Issue.
The U.S. attorney general explains in a logical manner why it is legal and lawful in some circumstances for a U.S. president to order the “targeted killing” of an American citizen. These deaths shouldn’t be called “assassinations,” the attorney general says, because assassinations are “unlawful killing” and, if the president approves it, then it’s not “unlawful.” More veils fall—“a person is innocent until proven guilty”; “intelligent people will make morally right decisions.” Our soul runs terror-stricken into the dark woods; our complicity with evil simply too much to bear.
THOMAS MERTON describes these moments as encounters with the Unspeakable. “It is the emptiness of ‘the end,’” Merton writes. “Not necessarily the end of the world, but a theological point of no return, a climax of absolute finality in refusal, in equivocation, in disorder, in absurdity ...” In the face of the Unspeakable, our nakedness is complete. All meaning is stripped away. Our carefully collected coverings lie in a heap. We are running into a silent, disorienting night.
Merton writes that the emptiness of the Unspeakable “can be broken open again to truth only by a miracle, by the coming of God.” This is the Easter story. This is our resurrection hope.
In utter exhaustion, we begin to feel the coolness of the night air chilling our exposed skin. The musty scent of olive leaves rises up from the ground. Moonlight uncovers a barely discernible trail through the woods. Night birds chitter in the branches, calling to one another for comfort. Ahead there is a campfire in the rocks. Still naked and bleeding we move closer.
Jesus turns his face to us. “Come. Sit by the fire. Let me get you something to eat.”

Joshua DuBois has been running the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships for President Obama for the past four years, but he leaves the White House today. That Joshua’s farewell party had to be moved to a larger location is just one sign of the respect and affection he earned during Obama’s first term. The President especially appreciated his young spiritual adviser, and read devotional biblical reflections from DuBois every day. At yesterday’s National Prayer Breakfast, President Obama lifted up Joshua’s importance to him and his administration, and said how much the young African-American Pentecostal pastor would be missed; the applause from the audience demonstrated the president wasn’t alone.
I have worked closely with Joshua, and want to wish him my own grateful farewell. I’ve watched this young man grow into this important job. He has been a good listener, facilitator, encourager, and convener; and has worked hard to put faith-based offices in executive departments throughout the administration — a first for any White House. Over the course of the last four years, Joshua has been successful because people both trust and like him, and the farewell comments at his going away party will show that. Joshua has especially worked hard to connect outside faith leaders and the faith-based community to key places and players in the White House to move agendas that we care about forward. [7].

When mentoring young professionals and students on planning their careers, I tell them what I wish someone would have told me early in my career. That is that two of the most important things you can learn that will enable your success in any field is communicating (especially public speaking) and developing strong business relationships. We’ll save communicating for another post but the topic of this post will be how to develop strong business relationships.
Most people take the standard “networking” approach to developing business relationships. They go to conferences, seminars, local chapter meetings, and networking functions regularly and hand out as many business cards as they can. The focus is solely on contact acquisition. If you’re primary activity in networking is handing your business card to every person you meet, you’re a networking jerk. Stop doing that!
Instead, you should focus on developing the relationships you already have.

Some of the Best Learning Experiences Occur Outside the Classroom
Today's companies are hiring ambitious MBA grads, and that number is increasing year by year. Though unemployment rates for the general population may be high, unemployment rates for graduate degree holders were 3.9% as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2010 and are expected to have dropped since then. Employers are seeking employees that can innovate, think critically, and communicate effectively. New hires need hands-on knowledge, not just any MBA degree.
Businesses and organizations demand real-world experience. That means the ability to make decisions and handle situations that comes from experience, not just the classroom.
In a recent survey of corporate recruiters from MBA.com, results confirm the needs modern companies have to hire MBA grads that are vetted with experiential education and past work performance:
The Mason MBA gives you the opportunity to connect your studies with the contemporary business environment. Classroom experiences are made far more valuable by high-impact out of classroom experiences that allow you to integrate theory with practice and advance your leadership and management abilities. A true education must go beyond classroom learning, making interaction with industry experts a part of the curriculum.
At George Mason University, we constantly find new ways to connect students with business leaders and influencers. Recently, students had the opportunity to spend the day with Warren Buffett at the corporate offices of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, in Omaha, Nebraska.
While it’s challenging to assign a value to something like the opportunity to meet an international business leader, student reactions make it clear:
“Mr. Buffett instructed us not to throw him any softball questions. Listening to him speak about investing made a difficult topic sound easy. The trip was an amazing experience that I will never forget,” said Andrew Desing '12 George Mason University MBA.
The Mason MBA also offers other experiential learning opportunities including a semester long consulting project that gives you the opportunity to work directly with a partner organization on a business plan, product launch, or market research. This hands-on course allows you to take business theory from the classroom and apply it in a corporate setting.
Make sure you build the skills you need before you graduate.

Fatal Attraction 2 starring Andrew Shirvell
Chris, look out! He may try to kill your bunny rabbit<<
8 comments:
He's a very bad man.
Is he gay? My gaydar goes off with him, but I know my gaydar isn't very well calibrated. What do you think?
I think he is. He's acting like an ex or a lovesick fool
everyone's gaydar is on point. I know a sistah when I see one.
I'm thinking they slept together and dude never called him back.
This really seems like lovesick revenge.
Yeah Cubby, even with your gaydar needing a tune-up. Virulently anti-gay usually adds up to virulent internalized homophobe.
I just hate that despite Chris' efforts to not give this guy any attention. He's managed to wrestle it up anyway. Both him and his boss have been on Anderson Cooper. Anderson was particularly peeved with him! It was great to watch.
I hope he's not gay, I don't want him to be family. He and Eddie Long need to go somewhere very far away and have their prayer circle and leave the rest of us out of it.
The homophobia trap. I say he is a sadist that loves to inflict pain on others without consent.
He does act like a scorned ex-lover, which he probably is.....in his head.
Sad, sick and twisted.

Ingredients:
- 6 boneless chicken breast halves, uncooked, without skin, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 can Cream of Chicken soup
- 1 cup mayonnaise (I use light)
- 1/4 cup lemon juice (I use more than this gives it great flavor)
- 1 tbsp curry powder (I use a lot more than this)
- enough cooked white rice for the people you're feeding
Preparation:
If you're going to cook this on the stove, use a large pot and cook the chicken just until white, then add rest of ingredients. Simmer for 15 minutes or so. Serve over rice. Same as above, you can put cheddar cheese on top and/or add broccoli.

All the world’s a stage, very literally, in Joe Wright’s wildly theatrical adaptation of “Anna Karenina.”
If you thought the director’s 5 1/2 the story Karenina (Keira Knightley), we’re more likely to notice how beautiful the suffering looks — the flattering lighting, her wild mane of dark curls spread meticulously across her pillowcase. during the past century but never like this.
Here Anna blond.

Facing Potential Recession, Retail Brands Turn to Specific Media to Target Consumers Online and Grow Revenues
Top four comScore-ranked advertising network helps retail brands reach target audiences with more relevant ads
Irvine, Calif. -- June 10, 2008 -- As the nation's retailers reported the weakest sales for the month of March since 1995 and sales in April declined another 0.2 percent, many retail brands are turning to Specific Media, the largest independent online advertising network for brand advertisers, to reach and engage with their target online audiences. Connecting with more than 145 million U.S. consumers online across hundreds of name brand publishers in its Premium Network, Specific Media helps leading retailers target online audiences and build their brands in the long-term, while converting shoppers' online interests into actual purchasing decisions in the short-term.
"As a pioneer in leveraging the online ad network space for retailers, NetPlus expects only the highest level of performance from its media partners in terms of ROI, targeting capabilities and customer service," said Denise Zimmerman, President, NetPlus Marketing. "Specific Media consistently delivers on all levels. As our clients face increasing economic pressure, we will continue to turn to Specific Media to help our clients meet their aggressive goals and expectations."
In addition to offering retail brand advertisers demographic, behavioral, contextual and geographic targeting solutions, Specific Media provides other innovative high-impact advertising options, which enable advertisers to take over its Premium Network inventory or a demographic, behavioral, contextual or geographic segment for an allotted time. These solutions provide scalable inventory and extensive reach, which are particularly effective for seasonal or regional sales events or openings.
Specific Media also enables retail brands to measure their advertising campaigns with offline impact reports which quantify consumers' offline purchase behavior to reveal the offline impact of online advertising campaigns. The reports include metrics such as purchases, revenue, dollars per buyer, share of purchases and share of dollars. Overall, these reports offer retail brands valuable best practices data for use in future media planning.
Power of Retargeting
In spite of the Internet's rising popularity, as many as 65 percent of online shoppers abandon their shopping carts before completing a purchase. Specific Media's site-level retargeting technology is regarded as the single most powerful method which can effectively find those consumers who have previously browsed an e-commerce site or abandoned their shopping carts and bring them back to complete their purchases. Studies reveal that returning customers - such as those brought back by Specific Media - spend the most time and money on e-commerce sites. Moreover, the company's clients utilize its impression-level retargeting to extend the frequency of category buys outside Specific Media's network.
"Retail customers can be very hard for advertisers to reach. By combining demographic targeting with behavioral, contextual and geographic components, Specific Media is the only advertising network able to reach specific consumer segments online with scale and accuracy," said Tim Vanderhook, CEO and co-founder of Specific Media. "The success clients - such as Net Plus Marketing - have had using Specific Media proves that it remains the advertising network of choice for top retail brands."

The topic du jour among the conservative chattering classes is the question of who will emerge as best choice to be John McCain’s running mate. The question is best approached first by forgetting about all the names and instead focusing on the qualities for which McCain ought to be looking. As is often the case, some of the conventional wisdom about who he should pick seems terribly misguided.
First, consider what McCain should not look for. Among those irrelevant considerations is a high profile. Nobody, absolutely nobody, is less in need of a running mate with a huge name or a big personality than John McCain is. McCain is so well known, and his “brand” so familiar, and his personality so seared into the public consciousness already that if he chooses a political rock star he will just overload the public’s senses.
McCain should not move left with his choice. Some in the media see certain secretaries of state or Democratic senators or “moderate” GOP governors as ideal choices — but they are wrong. What McCain needs, in order to free himself up to thrust and parry with the Democratic nominee, is somebody who can spend all his (or her) campaign time tending to restless conservatives..
The senator should not show weakness with his choice. Choosing a running mate from an overwhelmingly “red” state — unless that running mate brings something else incredibly special to the ticket — would be interpreted as a sign that McCain isn’t even confident of his geographic base. The Deep South, then, is not the best place to find a Veep. Neither is Oklahoma or Wyoming or Idaho, unless the choice brings something else so impressive to the table as to amount to a strategic coup of the first order.
Finally, McCain should not choose anybody who weakens his party’s tenuous hold on what power it still enjoys. He should not choose a senator whose home-state governor is a Democrat, nor should he choose a governor whose lieutenant governor is a Democrat, as both would likely result in a loss for the Republican Party.
SO WHAT QUALITIES are important? The most essential quality is a patently obvious ability to handle the job of president. Not to be morbid, but McCain is a 71-year-old man who has survived torture and several bouts of cancer. Voters will want assurance that the Veep could step in at a moment’s notice.
Related to this is the running mate’s relative youth. McCain shouldn’t choose anybody much over 60. Voters don’t like instability. The thought of one candidate over 70 might be acceptable, but the thought of two candidates past retirement age might just seem too risky.
The candidate ought also to be well rounded. McCain, by his own admission, has always focused on defense and foreign policy. A veep ought to also be well versed in those areas, but he needs to show some real expertise on domestic issues as well, in order to shore up McCain’s weaknesses there. Moreover, the running mate ought to have a resume that doesn’t say he’s a fulltime conventional politician. At least one item on the resume should say that this somebody who isn’t just a political climber but a doer.
It is preferable, but not entirely necessary, for the running mate to have some executive experience, whether inside government or out. This will be the first election ever that has featured one senator against another. Why? Because voters usually like executive leadership. McCain, despite his heroism, doesn’t have that. Being a squadron leader 40-some years ago doesn’t count. Plus, as McCain’s persona is that of maverick, he more than anybody needs to be balanced with somebody accustomed to hierarchy and management.
The VP nominee needs to be more “cool” than “hot.” McCain seems to want to reach through the TV screen and shake sense into the viewer. He needs to be balanced by a calm voice of reason.
McCain also needs somebody solid on all three legs of the conservative stool, somebody who the conservative media and intelligentsia will universally recognize as a legitimate conservative of solid principles and temperament — so those opinion leaders can reassure the voters that the choice is a wise one.
(With few exceptions, the choices will be unfamiliar to most of the public, so the idea isn’t to get somebody whose name along brings votes but rather somebody who can quickly be made acceptable to the “base” — much as John Roberts and Sam Alito were quickly accepted even though probably 95 percent of the nation had never heard of them before their high court nominations.)
The running mate also needs to be somebody who the establishment (liberal) media respect, that they won’t immediately write off as a bomb-thrower. And superb brains would be nice, since McCain’s image is all brawn. Being articulate and telegenic will be important, too, especially if Obama is the opponent.
DESPITE THE “NEW” conventional wisdom that says the success of the veep choices of Al Gore and Dick Cheney have shown that geographic and other more traditional political considerations no longer matter, this is one example of the older conventional wisdom being @ 4:43.

If the blacks ever wake up to the damage the teachers unions are doing to their children, the Democratic Party will be sunk for then it will have to chose between millions of votes (blacks) or millions of dollars from the teachers unions.
Alert1201| 11.5.10 @ 7:52AM
I agree. More harm is done to the black population by the school system then can be imagined, yet they continually support the whose who have made the school system the mess that it is.
The same is true for abortion.
joli| 11.5.10 @ 8:43PM
My friend told me that her freshman daughter had to sit and listen to her science teacher expound the glories of abortion for the good of the environment. As I think about what to do with my own kids when they begin to enter high school, I'm trying to decide whether the trade-off of having social and performing opportunities outweighs the necessity of having to re-teach science, history (Howard Zinn), and social studies every single day to deprogram them from the lies that are endemic in our schools.
Jocon307| 11.6.10 @ 6:29AM
Joli, I will give you the advice I give all parents, that was passed on to me by my own mom, which she learned by being "schooled" by her own father.
It is the "pound on the table" method.
When your child comes home from school and starts to tell you what teacher said today, and it is nonsense, you pound on the table, and expound the truth, and you keep at it, until the child understands that teacher is spouting nonsense.
It worked for my mom, it worked for me and it worked for my own child.
Although I have to say the schools she attended were pretty good, including the Bayonne, NJ (a very patriotic, Reagen democrat type town) public schools.
But the point remains, I always spent a lot of time with her on her school work, esp. in high school, and I tried very hard to get the larger points across.
Had her schools been dreadful, we would have had to make a change.
As a parent you must pay attention to what other people are attempting to put in your child's "head full of mush" as Rush Limbaugh says.
Hey, I should also give a big shout out to the Salvation Army of Jersey City, where my kid went to day care. Fantastic people, filled with the Love of God. They did a great job and for that they'll never be forgotten by us.
Big D| 11.8.10 @ 3:59PM
Joli - you have two choices: Homeschool or Private School. Neither are easy, and the latter is expensive, considering that you're paying for education twice (my property taxes support public indoctrination / "education", which I refuse to subject my kids to, and then tuition for a good Christian school). It sucks, but it's my kids and well worth it.
SonOfSam| 11.5.10 @ 9:19AM
Forty five years ago, white "progressives" launched the war on poverty. After four decades and trillions of dollars spent, poverty is just as widespread, and the inner cities are far more dangerous. They don't have a "gang problem", since these are far more than gangs: they are PRIVATE ARMIES ON AMERICAN SOIL. Vast swaths of American cities are effectively no longer part of the United States of America.
The only people who have benefited from all this are the upper class bureaucrats who run the programs and dole out the welfare checks, after they have kept most of the money to pay for their own bloated salaries, pensions and lifetime medical -- no ObamaCare for them, they're above all that.
the rich get bailouts
the poor get handouts
the middle class pays for it all
gearjammer| 11.5.10 @ 12:11PM
Now, now do not pick on the rich. Our fearless leader Rush insists we kiss their asses each and every day. So be careful, very careful or they will call you a ,gulp, Rino. Pick on the poor-bash the minimum like Rush's pal did in West Va.-like Rush says " it works every time you try it".
jstwndring| 11.5.10 @ 2:06PM
What the hell are you talking about? I want a specific instance where Rush was picking on the poor. I want a specific instance where Rush's friend (who?) in West Virginia was picking on the poor. I guess most of what Rush says goes right over your head. Defending the private property rights of Americans is the only thing i've heard Rush do regarding the topic of wealth. It sounds to me like you are the one who has the problem. Get past your jealousy. Get past your petty envy. Realise that this is AMERICA and you should be able to keep most of what you make, regardless of economic level. It's called liberty. Without private property rights any talk of freedom is academic. Of course, freedom for the masses always has been hard for the haters of liberty to understand.
geaqrjammer| 11.5.10 @ 5:23PM
His pal Racie lost to Manchon.He came out against the minimum wage and this cost him votes. Rush always says the most conservative candidate wins but Manchon who supports the minimum wage won, thus the less conservative candidate won proving Rush is wrong when he says the most conservative guy or gal always wins. Whether you like it or not the economic fairness issue is a big problem for you natives who dwell in the Rushbo tribe. We can at least be sympathetic to some silly increase in the min wage, which evidence proves is not the end of the world.
gearjammer| 11.5.10 @ 5:44PM
I heard one hardworking guy call Rush a few years back. He'd been working hard 40 years but lost his job and looked for work but came up with nothing. He had sadness in his voice that he,d have to take unemployment and in a defeated voice asked Rush if doing this for a bit was ok. The pompous rich a-hole Limbaugh in a less than approving voice said do what ya gotta do but actuallt told the guy that accepting the money might ruin his charactor as a man.Rush is an extremist. Smart and talented full of drive , but smarter people have walked the planet. Look into Aristotle and his golden mean.

Gearjammer made a salient point about Rush, and he is attacked in the rudest fashion.
It makes me sick to read mostof the posts on AmSpec. Rush is a muli-millionaire bigot and braggart with no compassion, except for his buddies--the right-wing super rich.
He has the soul of a hyena.

This post made absolutely no sense. What RX are you on? It would be helpful to use sentences and genuine English words.
It has always amazed me how a person will waste time listening and/or watching those they totally disagree with or downright hate. I suggest you get a life and listen to those of your own kind.
Soccerjock| 11.5.10 @ 8:10PM
It may not be the end of the world, but there is a lot of evidence that an increase in the minimum wage costs jobs at the margin. It certainly protects the wages of those under union contract whose wages are connected to the minimum wage. But the evidence I've seen shows that minority group unemployment goes up with every increase in the minimum wage. I think the best way to lower minority group unemployment rates is to lower the minimum wage, or eliminate it altogether. Union contract rates could be tied to some other economic indicator. All the minimum wage does is result in higher rates of unemployment for those people who are unskilled or just entering the labor force.
SeattleBruce| 11.5.10 @ 8:56PM
'thus the less conservative candidate won proving Rush is wrong '
WV has been Democrat since forever, and you're going to point to this one race with a popular Democrat Gov. running for Senate as your example. Bad choice.

The minimum wage was instituted to reduce black employment at the expense of white employment It worked then and still does.

Well, we could always follow the Democratic party model, sort of a twist on Robin Hood. "Rob the rich, and bullshit the poor." And if you are going to spout off about individual candidates, the least you could do is learn to spell their names.

Tex Expatriate| 11.5.10 @ 3:51PM
You must be a socialist, Gearjammer. You demonstrate the inability of socialists to be rational or to understand economics. Rush only points out that it is the rich who invest the money that is used to grow business in the world. The rich and the small businessman who stakes everything on his personal business gamble.
gearjammer| 11.5.10 @ 5:36PM
Actually, I fought commies in Viet Nam and enjoyed it. And, actually alot of middle class people own stocks etc too. Not just the rich. Whether you like it or not politics is more than an economics lesson. Emotion plays a role. I am not jealous of Rush-I consider him a troubled and terribly flawed man. The meglomania he demonstates each day is alarming. He is a detached out of touch conservative elite just like Obama and his crowd of swank set elites are. When, do you think is the last time rush spent time with regular people who have a tough life ? I am ok money wise but I stuck with my old friends over the richer and more sophisticaed I know. Not all-alot of my wealthy friends are ok and do not go nuts if somebody gets a minimum wage bump or unemployment insurance. They do get angry when it all goes overboard. But, let a guy get an extra buck a week and Rush goes nuts. the top one per cent making aall that money in income is another matter-we needs answers to thes ecopncern is all I am saying-sorry if I am looking ahead but clas warfare is not dead and the dems will ride it to a comeback, if alls we do is be rude and crude like
ruush is against the poor.
SeattleBruce| 11.5.10 @ 8:59PM
'When, do you think is the last time rush spent time with regular people who have a tough life ?'
When did this become about Rush? He's not the one spending us into oblivion, or didn't ya notice? We need to oppose those people. To that degree, who cares about Rush's weaknesses??!
DBinNJ| 11.5.10 @ 10:24PM
You sound like a logical guy so I let you determine the what is the correct answer.
You like the minimum wage so much why isn't the minimum wage $20.00 per hour or maybe $35.00 per hour? After all shouldn't the minimum wage be living wage?
Interested Conservative| 11.5.10 @ 11:01PM
Here's an even better one, DB - How about letting a company building a factory in a city set the workers' annual salary at twice the cost of an average home in that city?
In San Francisco, that would somewhere around $1million, but in Detroit it would be somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000?
What's a living wage if not the means to buy a home?
Think GM or Ford would take that deal? The UAW? Think it would repopulate Detroit?
Pragmatist| 11.6.10 @ 2:25AM
Why stop there. Why not set the minimum wage at $250,001 a year. Then everyone who has a job would be "rich." Then again, people without a job would be much poorer. People with a job, would be happy and gladly re-elect their representatives for the great favor of their guaranteed minimum wage.
Of course, everyone who could not generate goods and services for their employer in excess of $250.001 plus another 20% or so in mandated benefits would loose their jobs. [But, hey, you've got to break some eggs...] Either they would be laid off, or their employers would go bankrupt operating at such a loss. Industry would have to automate much more and lean how to operate without depending on all those low skilled less than $250K employees. But at some point an equilibrium would be reached with a small population of very higher earners, paying very high taxes in order to support a larger population of people unable to obtain legal employment reduced to living off of government assistance. Many jobs would disappear entirely. There would be fewer taxicabs in New York, but those cabbies would all earn over $250K a year, charging higher fares to a smaller population of passengers. Everyone would be much poorer with the employed taking home after taxes a very small portion of their 250K wages and the remainder living of subsistence of perhaps a fraction of that. Government would sponsor massive training programs so that the motivated could lift themselves from poverty by learning the skills needed to produce 250K (+20%) of value for their employers. Some would succeed, but there would be no way to enter at some lower salary, say 40K, and work your way up to 250K. That would be illegal. Even so, there would be an illegal shadow economy of people paying undocumented sweatshop workers to program computers under the table for sub-minimum wages. Many would languish in the ranks of the permanently unemployed.
Even those making $250K a year would be living at very low standard. Organizing society in such wasteful way would mean many fewer goods and services would get produced and the GDP pie would be much smaller for everyone, regardless matter how it was sliced.
Of course this thought experiment is extreme to illustrate a point. But the principle is the same. It differs only in degree.
The minimum wage creates no new value in the world. It produces nothing. If someone can produce value in excess of the minimum wage, the minimum wage is a wage they could have negotiated with their employer, anyway. If someone cannot produce value in excess of the minimum wage, they loose their job and it becomes illegal to employ them. Any perceived benefit is an illusion.

Rush is not against anybody making money. Rush is against the government setting the wages. Rush wants the market to set the price. If the market thinks $20 is a fair wage for burgerflippers then it is fine with him.

Here in America we only expect that the average person will "desire" to work for a living and do the best that they can on a daily basis. For the truly needy there is no more generous nation on earth than the one you and I served for. "Rush hates the poor?" This is Rushspeak filtered through a liberally sick mind.

One can only hope that you are correct. But these changes are also going to have to take place at the state level where the local teacher's unions contribute very heavily to legislators who play ball with them.
The continual rise in school taxes hasn't seemed to made them any weaker at the state level.
Money trumps votes in many cases.

Where I live (ultra conservative) N. Georgia our state won money for the “Rush” to the Top or whatever BO’s program was. Guess where 75% of the money is going? TEACHER’S SALARIES. The remaining; computers and technology. UGH!!!!
My child spent two years in a public school and it was all we could take. Like the one writer in these comments, I kept having to de-program him on ecology, environment and teach him to write papers and read something other than poetry.
Public schools are a mess and I pray every day for the children of America in these schools. They are hostile breeding grounds for the “No Child Left Behind”.

The answer is at the state. In Texas there are no teachers unions, whe have federations that provide health insurance and legal protection without the heavy handedness of union.

sounds good to me. As a teacher in a frost-bitten bluestate gulag, all I want is my for union to protect me from kids who want to take a swing at me when they fail because they refuse to do any assignments, and administrators who tell me that somehow its all my g-d fault because somehow I'm not "understanding" enough. I don't need them -- or anyone-- telling me how to vote. I also sure as hell don't want them hi-jacking a big chunk of my union dues to give to politicians I would never vote for, and who wouldn't cross the street to shake hands with me unless there's an election going on
Sheila| 11.5.10 @ 1:25PM
Not completely true, and not that big a deal anyhow. There are no branches of the national teachers' unions, but there are in-state unions here in Texas. Regardless of union affiliation, the teachers are all trained and certified by union-run ed schools. Even in Christian schools, in order to gain state accreditation (useful if you want your child's achievements to transfer to public high school, for example), all the teachers are "certified" - i.e. graduates of the same lousy ed programs. Because of the salary differential, many of them shift between public and private teaching. It's easy to differentiate those who've taught Christian school their whole career from those "perky" and "casual" younger teachers who began in public schools - avoid them like the plague they are. Most teachers are perfectly nice individuals - and thick as two short planks.

As a resident of north dakota, supporter of hoeven, husband of a teacher, the teachers of north dakota were split of supporting hoeven when he ran for governor. My wifes school were about 75% for him and the union was told to stay nuetral in the race. But the teachers union in the last weeks of the election spent its money to defeat him. he promised the teachers everything they wanted(nd teachers basically have a 401k so they dont need state or fed bailout) but they hate republicans here also.

The reality is that public-run anything gives you an exclusive monopoly wherein the provider avoids accountability. Without accountability, failure is the only outcome. If we are to ever solve the issues of worker security, pay, performance and quality we will have no choice but to admit that public education has been a complete failure. On the bright side of things, we now spend enough on public school pupil tuition to be able to afford to send every primary and secondary school child to private school and pay to send them to a 4-year college and still save some money to boot. That's how big of a debacle public education has become.

Since 1958 education has been the most expensive component of municipal abudgets. This is actually before the NEA became a union. Schools don't work (especially in inner cities) because the single parent doesn't care. The gangs inthe street are gangs in the school. One almosts suspects they have crew served weapons. Meanwhile teachers of varying ability work long hours doing paperwork. Most of the paperwork is
ridiculous but it has to be done. None of this has
anything to do with civilizing the next generation

No more half assed Rinos like the Bushes, Mc Cain and the rest of spinal deprived. The NEA and all public unions must be outlawed. They have no business using our funding to lobby for more bennies from us. No more state, NEA, Fed unions, period. And while they are at it no more government schools either - aren't we forced to buy education whether we want it or not????

In the minds of Teacher's Unions, the music composer turned High School Music Teacher from Mr. Holland's Opus should be viewed as the archetype teacher. This icon of dedication saw one student become Governor, another a successful businessman and a third a star athlete. Would the reality even faintly echo the movie.
How many unionized teachers send their children to private schools? How many unionized teachers work to the rule and not to the interest of their students? How many unionized teachers see their union dues go to supporting Socialist dogma spawned from the Communist-follower John Dewey?

SeniorD... WELL SAID! How many of you remember that the very first thing J.F.K. did the day he was inaugurated (After the ceremonies) was to sign an EXECUTIVE ORDER giving the public employees the right to collective bargaining and to strike. That absolutely needs to end! Public employees make more than those of us who actually work for a living. And that's just the first step. We need to cut the Federal budget 10% all across the board each year for the next five years. No exceptions. All federal employees, including elected officials, must be put on Medicare immediately, and get no other pensions than Social Security.
Who the hell do they think they are setting themselves above all of us WHO PAY FOR THEM! They all need to know that "We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it any more!"

Sheila| 11.5.10 @ 1:38PM
In my district they carry out the GPAs to as many as six decimal places to determine the valedictorian - always an Asian. Because of all the Chinese and Indian kids with their obsessive grade-chasing and cram school attendance, White kids with GPAs between 3.5 and 4.0 can't even make it into the top 10%, which has become a problem for many trying to gain admission to the best in-state colleges (I have no personal dog in this hunt; kept my kids in private school). The district is considering dropping class ranking because of this issue; the immigrant parents are up in arms - they want that number to brag to their friends about and to bludgeon the Whites with.
Texas Mom 2012| 11.5.10 @ 1:55PM
I don't care what the race of a valedictorian is, if you EARN it you deserve it. We have Valedictorians at our school but they also honor magna cum lause and summa cum laude graduates. My son, who is autistic but always mainstreamed and took some honors classes as well, ended up with a 3.12 and in the forth quintile or bottom 40% of his class. The upside is that his SAT scores would get him in any school in the country so his public school seems to have done its job. We moved to Sugar Land because of the excellent public school system willing to pay the higher real estate taxes for the privilege of better schools.

It's really time for the "middle-class" to start taking responsibility for their own success or lack thereof, if only because the "screw the rich" nonsense it buys into each election cycle hasn't helped one bit.

The education establishment, like any other vast, bloated, and insulated government apparatus, exists ultimately for the perpetuation and aggrandizement of the institution. In other words, it exists for the personal benefit of adminstrators and teachers, not for the education of students. That is why tax monies inevitably are directed to salaries, benefits, extravagant retirement packages, lifetime health care, excessive vacation, non-work days, perks, travel (ie. "conferences), programs, initiatives, coordinators, directors, assistant directors, superintendents, ad infinitum. And since the union leadership as well as the academic establishment are fundamentally leftist, students are subjected to ever more strident proselytizing in the popular delusions of the left, from "queer studies" to "global warming," while basic literacy and mathematical competencies are neglected.
The answer to the crisis is simple, though not palatable to those who prefer to abdicate their parental responsibility and hand over their children to highly-compensated baby sitters: PRIVATIZE THE SCHOOLS. There are many options: home schooling, parochial schools, church schools, private neighborhood schools and academies. Support private voucher and home schooling tax credit initiatives; reduce property taxes and other levies that currently fund the behemoth. Rescue your children. They are your children; and it is your money.

During FDR’s New Deal and WWII over 60 years ago, American farmers were fed up with the way Democrats clamped ceilings on prices for their crops but adamantly refused to do the same for wages. The Democrats and the unions, a reasonably happy, long lasting marriage which didn’t start with and won’t end with the teachers. And Walter Reuther, iconic labor leader of the UAW, unashamedly explained exactly how the game should be played, you collect dues from members, you give some of their money to the Democrats while keeping some for yourself, they pass those laws which help your union.
But let a teacher pat your kid on the head and tell the other Moms how bright she is and it’s “Walter Reuther who?”. It’s just not the same you say, young Miss Sweetsmile or old Mrs. Sternly, they’re not “real” union members, they don’t support crass union political practices, they think only of the children, teaching your kid is their life. When school children start paying union dues, your kid’s best interests will become important to the Teacher’s Union and the Democrats. Trouble in their marriage, the Teacher’s Union divorcing the Democrats – dream on, this isn’t the first grade and we’re too old for Story Time.

Read John Taylor Gatto's "The Underground History of American Education" and John Holt's "How Children Fail". The public school system was never intended to deliver education in the classic sense of the word but rather was engineered as a method of creating an artificial national concensus. You can remove your children from this institution of social engineering by sending them to private schools (as do the nation's eliete) or better yet by home schooling them yourself, as we did.
ton| 11.7.10 @ 7:17PM
You are correct; except that the "national consensus" to be created has always been a secularist, statist perspective (see the earlier quotes from Lenin).
Government schools were created in this country to advance a Dewyite agenda AND as an antidote (originally WASPish but now totally secular) to the growing influence of parochial schools among a burgeoning Catholic immigrant population in the early 20th century. For Christian parents, the choice is simple: who will direct the formation of your children, the secular state or the Church? The position of the state is equally simple: give us your children and your money.

After fifty years of dutifully trying to stay an informed citizen by paying regular attention to the American experiment in education, particularly K-12, by reading the Wall Street Journal et al, I long ago got the message.
It’s a waste of my time!
When the USA was started, the haves understood that the country couldn’t work if the have-nots could access their wealth. So, a voter was required to have a minimum amount of property.
Say you’re going to play a game of poker. In order to be able to join in the action, you have to have something to LOSE.
No chips = no game!
So, as soon as the “poor” got into the pockets of the “rich”, it was inevitable that “public” this or that would grow, like topsy!
A truly egalitarian schooling system would be based on the initial voting one---
The mother and father, would be SOLELY responsible to pay for their progeny, because, hey---they PRODUCED him or her! THEY did, not other people!
Now, if they had relatives and/or friends who they could convince to help, fine.
The public education racket is simply one of the expressions of that hoary ruse advertised back in the day, when “investing” in real estate was the hot subject---
Always use OPM---OTHER people’s money.

RISC Maker
As a computer architect, he rewrote the rulebook, and now, as president of a major U.S. university, he's ready to shake things up once again

Computer.
For someone about to enter the job market, this was not a bad position to be in. Hennessy's job search focused on academia. "I loved working on research and with students and never thought about doing anything else," he says.
He started as an assistant professor at Stanford, teaching a microprocessor laboratory course to graduate students and a systems programming course to undergraduates. His research focused on compiler optimization.
In 1980, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began funding researchers as it developed what would become its very large-scale integration (VLSI) research program. Stanford's project for DARPA, led by Forest Baskett and Jim Clark, was to design an IC chip to do three-dimensional graphics transformations. This design evolved into the geometry engine, the chip that was to be the foundation for launching Silicon Graphics Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), one of the first successful manufacturers of high-performance graphics workstations.
To implement the complex 3-D transformations, which required using floating-point arithmetic, the design resorted to microcode, a series of stored instructions that are not program addressable. The microcode translated the high-level geometric operations into simple instructions that could be implemented with a small number of transistors. As part of the Stanford team, Hennessy developed the high-level programming language and the compiler used to generate that microcode.
Hennessy was perfectly happy in academia. "I never envisioned trying to take my ideas out to industry," he said. But in 1981, Carver Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Pasadena) known to Hennessy through Mead's landmark work on VLSI, started a company to commercialize some Caltech research that demonstrated how to design VLSI chips from high-level descriptions. The company was called Silicon Compilers Inc. (now part of Mentor Graphics Inc.). Aware of the work Hennessy had done on the microcode generation language for the geometry engine, the charismatic Mead easily convinced him to spend one day a week working for his nascent company.
Hennessy ended up helping to define the microarchitecture, which included a pipeline and the engine for implementing the instruction set, for what was to become the MicroVAX 1, a computer released by DEC in 1984. This was the first single-chip implementation of the VAX minicomputer architecture. It was also the first large-scale use of high-level synthesis tools, often called silicon compilers.
This stint at Silicon Compilers was the beginning of what was to become a parallel life for Hennessy in industry. When Silicon Graphics was formed, Hennessy left his day-a-week job at Silicon Compilers for a day-a-week job there, where he worked on the system architecture for what was to become the company's first workstation.
Back at The Farm
Meanwhile, back at Stanford, often called The Farm, Hennessy had begun looking for a new area of computing to explore. To generate ideas, he organized a series of brainstorming sessions as a graduate seminar, asking this question of the group: given that VLSI will soon become the technology of choice, how should we change the way we design computers?
The group read papers, brought in guest speakers, and candidly exchanged ideas. The concepts that came out of the seminar helped to form the basis of what came to be called RISC. At the core was the idea of eliminating microcode. Instead of needing microcode to translate the instruction set, the processor would encounter instructions so simple that it could execute them directly. It was Hennessy's experience with microcode in the MicroVAX 1 project that helped him see that it could be eliminated.
Hennessy's group was not alone in coming to this conclusion. Researchers at IBM Corp. had for several years been working on the 801 project, an attempt to implement similar ideas. (The project was never brought to market, although the ideas influenced later IBM products, including the PowerPC architecture.)
Somebody else who also concluded that microcode was unnecessary was David Patterson, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley. Some six months earlier, he had discovered that computers could run more efficiently without it. Patterson's research team coined the acronym RISC.
But most of the rest of the computer world was skeptical that RISC would work. The fact that the original performance results were obtained from simulations only added to their doubts.
So Hennessy, with a handful of graduate students and the occasional collaboration of other professors, spent about 18 months designing, building, and testing a VLSI chip, along with compilers and a simple test computer, to prove the technology. Looking back, he admits they made a fair number of design errors and the chip wasn't as efficient as it could have been.
But, he said, "the opportunity for improvement was so big that the fact we made mistakes didn't matter. We built this little 25 000-transistor microprocessor, and it was twice as fast as a big minicomputer that cost US $250 000."
risc02.jpg Hennessy wrote papers and began giving talks about this new computer architecture, thinking that existing computer companies would be quick to embrace such an obvious technical improvement. "To say I was naïve," Hennessy told Spectrum, "is an understatement. People just didn't believe it."
Patterson, who was also promoting the new concept, did not see Hennessy as a rival. "We were a persecuted minority," Patterson told Spectrum. "It was better for us to be on the same team."
To get around town, John Hennessy drives a GEM, an electric vehicle made by DaimlerChrysler.
There were two issues to deal with, Patterson recalls, a technical one and a business one. "Technically, what we were doing was designing computers based on careful measurements at a time when computer designs were being driven by aesthetics. Computer architectures were supposed to be beautiful, not driven by efficiency," he said.
On the business side, people questioned whether RISC made sense economically. Using the analogy of train tracks, Patterson added, "While perhaps changing the width of train tracks might make technical sense, given the investment of infrastructure, it will never happen." Software would have to be recompiled for these new machines.
C. Gordon Bell, DEC's former vice president of R&D, thought otherwise, even though DEC's own RISC project had never come to fruition. He had just started Encore Computer Corp. (now Encore Real Time Computing Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) to create massively scalable computer systems, and he was aware of Hennessy's work on RISC. He told Hennessy that to get RISC ideas out into the world, he would have to start his own company, and that, if he did, Encore Computer would be his first customer and an investor.
"It was clear to me that a chip with RISC architecture needed to be built," says Bell, currently a senior researcher at Microsoft Corp. "I thought it would give us at least a one-time performance gain of a factor of two or three."
So Hennessy, along with John Moussouris, who had worked on the IBM RISC project, and Edward ("Skip") Stritter, who had worked on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, decided that starting a company was just what they would do.
Backing into business
"We went to the venture capitalists with the most ridiculous business plan you'd ever want to see," Hennessy says. "We had a bunch of slides about why this was a great technology and a spreadsheet showing how we'd spend the money. We didn't have a realistic technical schedule; we didn't have any marketing plan."
But they got funded in the summer of 1984 for $1 million from the Mayfield Fund, a venture capital company based in Menlo Park, Calif. That summer, MIPS Computer Systems Inc. set up its first office in subleased space in Mountain View.
Unwilling to completely give up his academic career, Hennessy took an 80 percent leave from Stanford, working there one day a week. He planned to return full-time once the company was solidly established. Since the initial technical research at MIPS was done, Hennessy, as cofounder and chief scientist, ended up becoming chief evangelist, doing cold calls on computer companies in an effort to convince potential customers that this first RISC microprocessor was going to change the world of computing.
About six months later, MIPS signed a letter of intent with its first customer, Prime Computer Ltd. (now defunct), committing to deliver chips by the end of 1985. In the final deadline crunch, Hennessy jumped in as needed, from working on the compiler team, to writing test code, to debugging the processor, and the MIPS R2000 came out on schedule. Then Hennessy turned his focus back to Stanford, though he still spends an occasional day at MIPS.
MIPS chips are now used primarily in embedded applications, including products such as the Sony PlayStation, Hewlett-Packard color laser writers, Cisco Systems network switches, and digital set-top boxes. The company had its initial public offering in 1989, was acquired by Silicon Graphics in 1992, and later spun out as MIPS Technologies. Countless other RISC chips have been designed since, and RISC is now the dominant architecture for embedded applications.
Hennessy's time in the corporate world fed positively into his university career. "In academia," he says, "we have a tendency not to make decisions until we get all the data in, know every single fact, and it's crystal clear what the right decision is. In industry, it doesn't work that way; time is considered a valuable commodity." Hennessy found that learning how to be decisive helped him in academia, particularly as he climbed up the administrative hierarchy.
With MIPS demonstrating that RISC was an important breakthrough in computer architecture, Hennessy decided to try to teach this new design method to students. Patterson, still at Berkeley, was doing the same thing. Of course, there were no textbooks. So the two decided to write one.
Taking sabbatical time, they moved into an office donated to them by DEC's Western Research Laboratory in Palo Alto. The fall of 1987 was spent figuring out the framework for the text: what it needed to teach and what its structure would be. They divided the chapters between them and edited each other's work. They then asked their colleagues in the industry to critique the book and, after reviewing suggestions, revised it. Finally, in the spring of 1990, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach was published by Morgan Kaufmann (San Mateo, Calif.). The publisher expected lifetime sales of the book to be about 15 000; it hit that number the first year. Hennessy and Patterson's book is still being widely used and has sold over 100 000 copies.
Back at The Farm—again
In 1988 Hennessy was running the Computer Systems Laboratory at Stanford, teaching introductory computer architecture to graduate students, and putting together a group of researchers to explore how the RISC approach might be employed in parallel computing.
"The key questions we asked," he says, "were: what was the right balance of hardware and software mechanisms, and how should the mechanisms change with larger numbers of processors?"
In small-scale multiprocessors, a technique called a snooping cache is used to maintain consistency among the individual cache memories associated with each processor. A snooping cache requires that each processor send notifications to all the other processors when it changes any shared data. So, if more than 20 or 30 processors are used, they end up spending most of their time on notification.
One solution would be to use a single shared memory and not cache data that could be shared. But with large numbers of processors, that approach falls apart: the memory becomes a bottleneck and is much slower than the individual caches. "The conventional wisdom," Hennessy says, "became that because of the cache coherency problem, you could not build a large-scale multiprocessor with a shared memory."
So in the 1980s, several groups around the country, including researchers at Caltech and Intel, were trying to optimize an approach called message passing, which avoids shared memory. Rather, it requires that data be explicitly communicated by messages between processors. Unfortunately, that setup uses a different programming model from that used for multiprocessors with a few tens of processors.
Hennessy and his students at Stanford instead decided to reconsider cache coherency. Rather than physically building a central shared memory, they created one logically. That is, each of the multiple, physically distributed memories has a dedicated cache, and the computer maintains a directory with each memory, keeping track of which processor has which memories in its cache. When information is changed or needed, each processor simply refers to the directory and then just sends out a single message.
The first paper describing this directory concept was published by Hennessy and his colleagues in 1988; the group built a working design in 1992. The machine was called DASH, for Directory Architecture for SHared memory. Silicon Graphics used the directory approach embodied in DASH in 1996 in its Origin workstation, a scalable high-performance computer, and several other companies have employed the technology since.
Steps to the presidency While Hennessy went on being involved in research for some years, his administrative functions at Stanford were increasing, as he stepped up to department chairman, then dean of engineering, then provost, and, now, president.
"John shot through the academic hierarchy faster than anyone I've seen," Patterson says.
Even as president, Hennessy does some work outside the university, al-though it now takes less than 10 percent of his time. This past year, much of that has been spent with Patterson preparing the third edition of their textbook. He also supervises one or two Ph.D. students and advises 15 undergraduates.
As president, Patterson observes, Hennessy runs the university with an engineering perspective, assuming he can analyze every problem and find the best solution. He has earned broad loyalty on campus because, Patterson believes, he is honest, doesn't play games, and speaks the truth, even if his positions aren't popular.
Hennessy sees a university presidency as being something one does for about a decade. These years will be busy ones, for Hennessy has made himself a long to-do list. After his term is over, he says, he might take a real sabbatical, instead of starting a company or writing a book. Or not.
"The great thing about being a university president is you can keep that most wonderful of titles—professor. So you are able to go back to teaching and working with students," he says. And, undoubtedly, doing a little something on the side.

Every now and then, there’s a hit movie that so captures the collective imagination that I avoid it like the plague. My college film professor’s effort to quash enthusiasm for even the remotely popular (he repeatedly dumped on Run Lola Run or anything involving Tarantino) left its mark on me to the point that I, too, became a cinematic curmudgeon incapable of suspending disbelief long enough to enjoy a cultural event.
But that’s not why I avoided Jerry Maguire. I never got around to seeing that particular Tom Cruise picture simply because, by the time I reached the legal age to rent a copy, I felt as though I’d already seen it. At that point, catchphrases like “Show me the money,” “You complete me” and “You had me at ‘hello’” were ingrained within our cultural lexicon to the point that I got the gist of the flick: a smarmy pro-football agent works his butt off to placate Cuba Gooding Jr. and woo Renée Zellweger. Big whoop. In fact, I’d so dismissed ever giving a damn that I came full circle on this movie; as the popularity of its memes waned, I wondered if maybe I’d missed something by never giving Jerry Maguire a shot. Perhaps, without knowing it, I was incomplete.
So I entered my long overdue viewing of this Cameron Crowe-directed feature with relatively high hopes. After all, Tom Cruise used to be able to act (sort of), and the film revolves around pro football, one of my most longstanding pleasures. But as the movie opened with a shot of Earth and Cruise providing the obvious narration “So this is the world,” I gained my first inkling that I was in for two hours of Crowe painting with broad strokes. As the titular pro-sports agent (Cruise) collects high-fives and absorbs enough backslaps to herniate a disc, he’s supposed to be unlikable. But as Jerry incurs both a standing ovation and a pink slip for penning a self-righteous novella-length memo during a dark night of the soul, I remembered that plausibility is not Crowe’s strong suit.
As the plot unwinds, pouty accountant Dorothy (Zellweger) impulsively follows the recently-axed Jerry out of the office, and the bombastic Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr.) sticks with him for some equally obscure reason. And away we go. I spent the majority of the film’s 139 minutes trying to puzzle out how anything in Jerry’s philosophical approach changes after he delivers that career-threatening memo. Despite brief moments atop a soapbox, Jerry rarely practices what he preaches and — instead of embracing integrity — continues to sniff around for money while feeling sorry for himself. He uses Dorothy’s loyalty to quell his own fear of loneliness, hastily marrying her rather than allowing her to move away. When Tidwell calls him out on assuming a father figure role to Dorothy’s young and unnecessarily cute son (Jonathan Lipnicki) as a means to get into her pants, Jerry admits that he “shoplifted the pootie.”
That’s not to say that Jerry Maguire is all bad. There’s much to admire in the scope of the film (Crowe is nothing if not ambitious). The realistic on-field NFL scenes dazzle until Tidwell awakens from a head injury to indulge in a protracted and outrageous touchdown breakdance. Zellweger rose to prominence following her empathetic performance as Dorothy, and Gooding Jr. deserved his Best Supporting Actor nod for the engrossing portrayal of a flamboyant wide receiver. Furthermore, the film presciently highlights the destructive nature of concussions 15 years before that specific injury gained its current preventative focus within the NFL. And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t relish the cameos by the likes of Drew Bledsoe, Troy Aikman, and Warren Moon. Even the old-school “Monday Night Football” trio of Frank, Al and Dan make an appearance. But while the film succeeds in the believability of its setting, Jerry’s transformation never fully manifests. The “you complete me” payoff (a ham-fisted line to begin with) doesn’t resonate with me because I don’t believe for a second that Jerry changes.
The fact that this movie received Best Picture and Best Actor nominations (Cruise essentially does little more than tap into his own mania) may speak more to the period of its release than the quality of its content. There’s a dated feel to every frame, and era-specific cultural references lose their zing after a decade and a half. What may have been a heartwarming cinematic experience in the mid-‘90s now comes off as cheesy and stale. At least “shoplifted the pootie” never caught on.

FashionTuesday, December 22nd, 2009
Around this time during the past several years, I find myself thinking that my work is out of fashion, out moded. Usually, I don’t know what causes it – a slowing down of activity, seasonal depression (this is Seattle after all). What triggered it this time, however, was an invitation from Zoë Scofield and Juniper Shuey to attend their APAP showing at The American Realness Festival. The details are unimportant in many ways but what struck me about the invitation and set me off was how aware I was of a shift in aesthetic tastes as evidenced by the artists that are the “real Americans”, those included in the Festival, Miguel Gutierrez, Ann Liv Young, Luciana Achugar, Layard Thompson, Jack Ferver and Jeremy Wade. Some of it is generational of course and of course I am not only another generation but also fall into another set of aesthetic values category as well… Wow, I think to myself — this is what old feels like!
The problem is that there is a tendency to think of these aesthetic shifts as absolutes; that generational shifts in perspectives are truths and not just a truth but permanent and absolute truths. Yes, these shifts are indeed real but just like dance they are ephemeral, transitory, and temporary. And like fashion or trends, well, even life itself, they will again shift, change and be different…
Last week in the New York Times Roslyn Sulcas and to some degree an unaccredited author in the Financial Times while writing on the Judith Jamison 20th anniversary celebration as artistic director of the Ailey Company, repeatedly vomiting out and regurgitated the same half digested stale old rhetoric about the mediocrity of the works commissioned and revived by the company under Ms Jamison tenure. What they both failed to recognize is that those works in many ways represent the dance fashion of the time that they were created, pieces from the “ready to wear collections” of the choreographers, if you will. And like padded shoulders and thick eyebrows they were meant to be no more than what they were, popular and the look of the time. They help to sell the company; they brought audiences in to the theaters and put butts in the seats. And like the perennial Nutcrackers that populate our stages at this time of year, they delighted some and perhaps help to whet the appetites of a few for something more substantial. If these choreographies did not meet the “classic” test, well most things don’t, but they served their purpose – they made the Ailey Company the most well-known and successful modern dance company in the world!
Ms Sulcas concludes,” But the depressing conclusion to be drawn here is that, in the main, the choreography challenges neither the dancers nor the audiences. It’s even more depressing that everyone seems to like it that way.” I say – Who said that fashion or entertainment was about challenges? What Ms Sulcas and other like-minded critics might value might be of no value to Ms Jamison and the supporters of the Ailey Company and the opinions of such critics might be like people deliberately and continuously farting and fouling the air during a birthday celebration of a beloved relative.
Now back to my original thought. If my work or aesthetic values are outdated, do my past work and my current work have value? Do I need to dress-up what I do differently in order for its worth or content to be gotten or appreciated? Another set of questions might be: Is much of the American dance works currently in fashion today devoid of “content”? But rather the aesthetic packaging is the content? Its stylishness, its construction, its cleverness, how it’s accessorized (video, text, celebrity artists collaborator), its intellectual conceits, and its total visual appeal might be “the point”?
Perhaps what is most valuable for me in all of this thinking and wondering is – none of this has anything to do with why I do the work I do or whether I will continue to do it. I get value from what I do and the dances I create and there appears to be others that get value as well. During my 33 years of making dances I have found myself many times, to paraphrase Heidi Klum the host of Project Runway, being out one minute and in the next minute. But it has never been auf Wiedersehen.

I just started using my new I2C LCD Interface v3 and, since I am using it with an old LCD module with no backlight, I have had no problems. There will be a serious problem if and when I attempt to use it with my newer backlit LCD module since you have made no provisions for a current limiting resistor. I realize that many of the newer LCD modules have a built in current limiting resistor but you should realize that many do not. I didn't notice this omission until I had already mounted the transistor. I suppose I can remove the transistor and put the current limiting resistor between it's C and E pads thus giving up software control of the backlight. Do you have a better suggestion since PWM is not an option when using an I2C extender.
It wouldn't be hard to incorporate such a resistor in your current board design but it would obliterate the silk-screen lettering for the push buttons unless you make the board longer. While you are at it you really should reconsider how you are implementing your backlight control. Specifically, since you are using high side switching you should be using a PNP transistor. This should be almost trivial to fix using your current board design.
Another improvement, which would probably require some extra real estate, would be some jumpers to enable/disable the I2C pull-up resistors. I have connected mine via some machined pins so I can remove them but jumpers would be nicer.

So, I have not long gotten my grubby mitts on the TT frame I have been seeking for a good few months, and while hunting around this massive web of goodness, for inspiration on a somewhat ‘period correct’ build, I came across this super and smashing forum thread of pure appreciation for the golden era of British Time Trialling.
As many black and white and colour photograph scans that one could ever wish for. Seriously, page after page of sloping top tubes, drilled out brake levers, skin suits, 24″ front wheels, the lot.
A big thanks to all the contributors of said thread, your photographs are nothing short of amazing!…)

To start you're going to need a Wayfinder Helmet(dropped by the Main boss in the Warehouse) and 5,366 gold.
_4<<.
Thank you!! My Myth alt (a boy) went from around 42K gold to over 125K in a couple of hours last night.
For me the robes turned out to be a little faster than the hats, buying one defaulted to the cheapest brown/brown combo so I didn't need the extra step of changing to those colors first.
This guide is great because I am sitting on three robes that I can't sell without losing money! Yay me! >:(
It works for everyone :). Only problem - If a Wayfinder hat/robe is already in the catalog in the Bazaar your hat/robe sells for a lot less so you have to wait till they are all sold. Thanks for the mention and discovery!
Thank you for telling me this. I really need to know how to make gold. I only have about four hundred twenty two. So like I said before keep posting your awesome posts and you and your house are AWESOME!

Ditch The Dumbbells And Get A Chin Up Bar
The chin up bar has become the most intimidating piece of workout equipment out there. The reason is because it is the one thing that will tell you exactly how strong you are. Forget doing a ton of curls or bench presses. If getting your head over the bar is impossible to do then you are not pound for pound strong. Focusing on getting better at chin ups is a must for anybody looking to get into shape.
Have you ever noticed what kind of people use a pull up bar? You will probably notice that they have a lean muscular figure. There is no room to build up a lot of bulk because you need the lean muscle to power through more reps. With not being able to add weight you have to do more reps. This is how you build lean muscle and endurance.
If you are looking for a back, bicep, shoulder, and core workout then this is what you need. Depending on what type of pull up you are doing, the bicep is going to take the brunt of the exercise. Reverse grip chin ups focus on back, shoulders, and abs. Wide front grip pull ups use shoulders, back, and your core. Close grip use shoulders, back, and core. Most people do not realize it but your core get a workout as it needs to keep the rest of the body in one place.
It is not uncommon to see people put on ten pounds of lean muscle within a month just from working on chin ups. Your body is the best resistance you can get. The chance of injury is very lower when doing them because gravity is doing all of the work and there are no free
Many people who get use to doing them take a break from doing curls as they are getting better results from pull ups. It is more fun telling people that you can do 20 chin ups at one time then saying you curl 45 pounds. If you want to sculpt your upper body and arms then you need to go and get a P90X pull up bar as soon as possible and start trying to do them. Many people who do the P90X workout live by this exercise when they are done.

There is no doubt South Africa deserved to win, as they produced 20 minutes of the most amazing rugby we have seen since the 2007 World Cup.
However, the 36-27 win over England in Johannesburg on Saturday produced everything that is good, bad and even ugly about Springbok rugby.
Four tries to three, 22-3 after 20 minutes and the Boks looked like world champions. Move the clock on 40 minutes and the scoreline reads 31-27. Also, after leading 28 - 10 just after half-time, the home side managed to lose their structure and had to scramble for the win.
Injuries may also have been a factor, as the high number of replacements impacted on the Boks' momentum.
Jan de Koning rates the South Africa players!
15 Pat Lambie:
His positional play was from the top drawer and not even a heavily strapped ankle (when he came down heavily from a high ball in the first half) seemed to bother him.
6/10
14 JP Pietersen:
He found his verve and swerve, while his workrate was even more impressive. There was one great run in the second half - when the Boks were under pressure and he finished off a move he started way back in his own half - that said all about his game. His defence was also exemplary - such as the occasion when he shoved a charging Thomas Waldrom into touch.
8/10
13 Jean de Villiers (captain):
Great chasing to set up scrum five metres from England line and his defence was dominant - resulted in a few turnovers. However, it was his sublime off-loading that really impressed.
7/10
12 Frans Steyn:
Took the ball up strongly and then produced a sublime grubber that almost resulted in a try. However, his power with all in hand is what made him so valuable to this team.
7/10
11 Bryan Habana:
He continues to regain his best form, even though it was by no means flawless. Made plenty of ground with ball in hand early in the match, and even starting to win turnovers at the breakdown.
6/10
10 Morné Steyn:
He appears to be so intent on silencing those critics, who suggest he is one-dimensional and doesn't have a running game, that he is neglecting what makes him so great - his kicking. While his out of hand kicking mostly kept the English on the back foot, he did put one directly into touch that ultimately resulted in an England try. His goal-kicking remains an issue and some of his options can be questioned.
5/10
9 François Hougaard:
His options were much better and only when he sniped it counted. He handled the ball 79 times, passing it 72 times. And he scored a great try.
6/10
8 Pierre Spies:
The most impressive aspect of his game - apart from his powerful carries and weaving runs - was his work off the ball and a number of line-out steals.
7/10
7 Willem Alberts:
He set the tone with that early pick-up from a scrum for the opening try and then continued with those bullocking runs to which England had no answer. He could do a bit more work on defence.
8/10
6 Marcell Coetzee:
He ran into space and took the ball up at pace to ensure the Boks got on the front foot from the outset. He also produced the highest tackle count of the Boks and did not slip a single one.
7/10
5 Juandré Kruger:
One of the unsung heroes of the pack - doing the hard yards in the close exchanges. He was missed when he left the field.
6/10
4 Eben Etzebeth:
He is growing in stature with every match and at this rate will be a fixture in the Boks' second row for years to come. Another monster on defence.
7/10
3 Jannie du Plessis:
His scrumming has improved incredibly and his cleaning out at the ruck was also impressive. Did not slip a single tackle.
6/10
2 Bismarck du Plessis:
His workrate was immense in the early stages - cleaning out countless rucks and then charged at the English as much as any of the other Bok forwards. He produced his usual turnovers.
7/10
1 Tendai Mtawarira:
Beeeaaaast! That cry went up numerous times and grew louder with every metre he gained in the first half. But he was the epitome of the Bok team after the break - some strong moments and then got dominated in the scrums.
6/10
Replacements:
16 Adriaan Strauss (on for B du Plessis, 60 min):
Simply did not have the same impact as last week.
5/10
17 Werner Kruger (on for J du Plessis, 59th min):
One very strong run, but then penalised at another scrum. Boks appeared to lose momentum with the changes.
5/10
18 Flip van der Merwe (on for J Kruger, 62nd min):
He had his moments, but also disappeared at times. Struggled to get into the game.
5/10
19 Keegan Daniel (on for Alberts, 52nd min):
He did nothing wrong, but was pretty much anonymous and the absence of Alberts was certainly felt by the Boks.
5/10
20 Ruan Pienaar (on for Habana, 57th min):
Made one tackle, but was mostly a link. Another questionable replacements.
5/10
21 Wynand Olivier (on for Lambie, 44th min):
Made his tackles, as he always does, but otherwise had no impact on the game. His move to centre also eliminated the effectiveness of Frans Steyn, who moved to fullback.
5/10
22 Bjorn Basson:

Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has called for Mohammad Amir to be recalled to the national team once he has served his ban for spot-fixing.
Amir was last year jailed along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif after taking part in spot-fixing during Pakistan's tour of England in a scandal that rocked cricket.
Amir was also given a five-year ban from cricket but has appealed against the length of the sentence and indicated a desire to resume his cricket as soon as possible.
"I would have him back," Khan said during an interview on the BBC's TMS show. "He didn't lie. He was straightforward. He said, 'Look, I did this, it was a mistake, and I ask for forgiveness'.
"And for a 19-year-old, yes, I would forgive him.
"My heart has always gone out to Amir because he was one of the best young talents I've seen. But at least he pleaded guilty straight away and said 'I've made a mistake'.

Ger Lyons is in no rush to formulate future plans for Lightening Pearl following her defeat in the QIPCO 1000 Guineas on Sunday.
Last year's Cheveley Park heroine was making her seasonal reappearance but having got worked up before the race, was ultimately well beaten into 13th place.
There was drama before the off as Gray Pearl got trapped under her stall and had to be put down, causing a lengthy delay before the start of the race and Lyons feels a number of factors contributed to his filly's below-par effort.
"She's fine this morning and the plan is for her to travel home this afternoon," said Lyons on Monday.
"It was just one of those days, unfortunately. It was a bit of a funny race as the first and last furlongs were slow and they were sprinting in the middle part of the race.
"The Godolphin fillies were last and second last, we had to stand behind the stalls for 25 minutes and it was just one of those races you have to put behind you and move on I think.
"She travelled away well behind the winner but then when she quickened, our filly quickened slightly but not enough.
"I don't think we learnt a whole pile about the trip. The ground wasn't so bad that we would take her out, but it probably wasn't ideal and it was more than likely a combination of the ground and the trip.
"I also wasn't happy with her in the pre-parade ring as she was getting agitated, which isn't like her as last year she was so professional.
"She's in the Irish Guineas and the July Cup. There is a good sprint at York in the summer as well, so we have options.
"We'll just see how the filly is over the next couple of weeks. Sunday was disappointing, but that's racing.
"We still have our filly this morning and the connections of Gray Pearl unfortunately don't, so you have to put things in perspective."

SAN FRANCISCO -- If we're lucky, the Dominican Republic made history Tuesday night. No, it wasn't just that they won the World Baseball Classic with a 3-0 victory over Puerto Rico in a game they controlled from the first inning. It wasn't that they became the first team to go undefeated in the tournament, running the table from San Juan to Miami to here with eight wins in which they allowed just 14 runs. No, maybe they gave us something more lasting than titles and trivia.
It's what the Dominicans did after a brief celebration that followed the last out: they walked across the infield and met the Puerto Ricans by the first-base line -- near the Puerto Rico dugout -- and gave them handshakes and hugs.
What an even more beautiful baseball world it would be if every Major League Baseball postseason series, if not regular-season series, ended with such a show of respect and sportsmanship. What a legacy for the Dominicans and the Puerto Ricans if the postgame handshake becomes a baseball tradition, and generations could forever mark the 2013 WBC final as the moment when class took root in the game.
"Yes, I would like to see that in the major leagues," said Dominican reliever Octavio Dotel. "It shows that we can play hard and compete against each other but in the end we are all family."
The moment was a touching one for Caribbean baseball. The rivalry between the Dominicans and Puerto Ricans has spanned many years and intense winter baseball seasons, but always with respect and a sense of commonality. But Dotel agreed the postgame handshake could well hold bigger meaning than it does in the islands.
"Hopefully this is a message for the rest of baseball," he said.
Only two nights earlier, Japan provided its own version of civility and sportsmanship. Upon a disappointing semifinal defeat to Puerto Rico, the Japanese players lined up on the third-base line and bowed to the victors, and then bowed to the fans.
It's a gaping hole in the American game when you think about it. Teams shake hands on every amateur level in baseball. Teams in virtually all other sports do it, even when the underlying purpose of the sport is to beat the other guy's brains out. Individual sports such as tennis and golf do it.
But when you become a professional baseball player you literally turn your back on the team you just competed against and leave the field without so much as a "good game."
Even fifth and sixth-graders know it should change. In 2005, students at the Merriam School in Acton, Mass., petitioned the Yankees and Red Sox to begin their season-opening game with a handshake, a nod to the school's peace-making effort on the school playgrounds. Red Sox manager Terry Francona said it was up to the players. "I'm not going to make them do it," he said.
Come game time, the 40 or so students gathered in a classroom to watch the introduction of the players. The kids chanted, "Shake, shake, shake." But the players turned their backs on the other team and returned to their dugout. Nothing changed.
Managers do shake hands when lineup cards are announced and batters often greet the catcher upon their first at-bat of a game. Great. A postgame or post-series handshake would work even better.
The Dominicans were a treat to watch to the very end. They played with smiles and fervor. They showed that you can play hard and still have fun -- imagine that.
One of the biggest lies of the tournament was that "some people," especially the Americans, were upset with the way the Dominican players celebrated strikeouts, hits and runs. It was a media-driven non-story, a grab at a quick headline. As USA manager Joe Torre said, they played with passion and never directed their exuberance into the face of their opponents. Torre had no problem with how they played. Every player on the record had no problem with it. It was one of the joys of the tournament.
The Dominicans had every right to enjoy the Classic. They dominated while singing songs in the dugout and waving a rally plantain -- just the kind of silly stuff you might see on a youth baseball field, before everybody gets so caught up in "acting the right way" and tamping down enthusiasm becomes an American coaching requirement.
The Dominican bullpen closed out the tournament with 25 2/3 scoreless innings. Jose Reyes played every inning as if his pants were on fire. Fernando Rodney, keeper of the plantain, was a treat to watch in the dugout and on the mound. The Dominicans played with an intense sense of purpose and pride, born partly from their embarrassing first-round knockout in 2009 with two losses to the Netherlands. Their players trained all winter to be game ready for early March.
Meanwhile, back in the U.S. in January, Torre fought tooth and nail to get one more workout day for Team USA out of the 30 general managers. Torre was trying to forge a spirit of teamwork among his guys and get them ready for tournament baseball. The general managers would have none of it. They said no to even one measly additional workout day.
If the USA is going to do anything in this tournament, it should have the American players report to a team training camp, not to their MLB camps. The USA team would be the 31st team in spring training and train and play games together against other MLB teams before the tournament.
Not only does Japan do it this way, they also have tryouts for the team. Yes, they cut players in order to arrive at their WBC roster.
In the Dominican, nobody complained about training harder or earlier to be ready for the WBC, as Americans have done. Nobody wrote it off as an exhibition, the way Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels did. The Dominican Republic was fully vested in the event. They are worthy champions who taught the rest of the baseball world lessons about pride and enthusiasm, but also, in the end, sportsmanship. Let this be just the beginning of something wonderful.

"Every kid you see on the street here with a football wants to play in an FA Cup final at Wembley," says Kasey Keller, the American goalkeeper for the south London club Millwall. "That is the pinnacle. The FA Cup final is the World Series, the Super Bowl and the NBA Finals combined. That's it. There is nothing more."
Ten-year-olds playing two-a-sides in West London—their "goal" a closed gate at the Queens Park Rangers' ground—all claim to be Ranger striker Les Ferdinand, with a spot in the final on the line. "Goal!" shrieks a lad in the blue-and-white hoop stripes of QPR. "Ferdinand! Two-nil! Rangers are in the Cup final against...against...Man United!"
"No," says the goalkeeper. "They're bad luck. Villa."
"Against Aston Villa!"
In real life, mighty Manchester United eliminated QPR on its way to this year's Cup final. When the Reds kicked off against Everton three weeks ago, they were watched in 70 countries, by 500 million people, many of whom had been backing Man United since the '58 Cup final. That year United reached Wembley only three months after the team's plane crashed on takeoff in Munich, killing eight players and 15 other passengers. United lost the Cup to Bolton but won the world's everlasting allegiance.
"I've had conversations about Man United in the Bolivian Andes," says novelist and soccer writer Pete Davies, whose acclaimed account of the English team in the '90 World Cup, All Played Out, has been published in...Japanese. "There is a team in Namibia called Liverpool. There is a team in Lesotho called Arsenal. When Man United won their first league title in 26 years [in 1993], BBC Radio reported the celebration live from a supporters' club in Bondi Beach, Australia."
In soccer England still has an empire free of sunsets. John Harkes, a U.S. midfielder and five-year English League veteran who played for Sheffield Wednesday in the '93 FA Cup final, reads the postmarks on four months of fan mail backlogged in his Derbyshire home. "Germany, Hungary, Thailand, Hong Kong..." he begins. "I try to respond immediately, but...."
But it's impossible to keep up, even for one used to the VCR-on-scan pace of soccer as played in the British Isles. "All-out attacking...up-tempo...fast-break" is how Man United fan Hakeem Olajuwon has described the English League game. But this only begins to account for its planetary appeal, only begins to explain why....
Why, when Fidel Castro was touring French vineyards in March, he asked to attend Arsenal's match at nearby Auxerre in the quarterfinals of the European Cup-Winners Cup, a tournament among domestic cup champions from the previous season. (El comandante let slip that he has long been a Gooner, as Gunner fans are globally known.)
Why, when Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia under tight security in 1994, after 20 years in political and football exile, his Alaska Air ticket bore the pseudonym MR. R. GIGGS.

Why aren't people converting to Drip irrigation?
by Scott76 (May 2nd 2013, 1:59pm)
We are not seeing the change over to drip/micro irrigation that we were expecting after the drought last year.
Considering the water restrictions in place last year and the money savings of drip I'm surprised.
Reasons for the reluctance to change?

I came across a couple of useful things today relating to Google Apps.
The first is a student perspective on the ease of use of Google Apps for her course. She is very articulate and succinct in her responses, and shows a mastery of her digital environment.
If school children are demonstrating this level of knowledge, understanding and proficiency in using Google Apps then it seems out of step to be providing anything proprietory at university, particularly if it offers less functionality and required students then learning an unfamiliar environment that they won’t use again after graduation.
A teacher also talks about her use of Google Apps for her classes.
As a supplement to the above, there are some resources available at Google Tools for Educators including links to some useful videos.

Anyway, last night I cleaned out the fridge of some chicken, onions and carrots and made my chicken and dumplings, but instead of making dumplings, I added some rice. It was tasty, but after awhile, the rice virtually dissolved into the yummy creamy broth. Oh well. I still had two bowls.
I've also been meaning to point this out. A few weeks ago in the Washington Post, they had a little product highlight that included: Pinch Plus!
So we've all encountered the situation where you don't have a jar of a certain spice and you only need a small bit. Pinch Plus is almost a solution for that dilema. Pinch Plus packages spices in little, sealed packets that contain One Tablespoon of the herb or spice. I like the idea in general. It's a great way to affordably try new spices and herbs or not have to throw away the outdated, stale products in your cupboards. The downside comes to the variety of spices. Most people would be comfortable buying a jar of basil or cinnamon. So my only suggestion is the broaden the product base and include different varieties of curry or branch into some of the more exotic herbs and spices.
Maybe their could be a partnership with Nirmala's or Penzey's? Anywho...I do like their packaging of certain spice combinations into little booklets with coordinated recipes!

I've done that too with chicken and dumplings, replacing the rice. It's jsut as good.
Hmmmm.... I'm afraid I may have a whole cabinet drawer full of stale old spices. How long do they normally last?
Stef: I've heard that spices last from 6 months to 2 years...I know I have spices have been around much longer than that!!! Spices I'm comfortable keeping a touch longer than I will herbs.
While spices do lose their flavor, I find that just heating them in a dry pan perks them right up.

The St. Anne's School Experience
"When I was looking for a preschool for my daughter, I sought out all the schools in the area. I stopped by St. Anne’s School for an application and a young girl lead me to the office and said that she loved it at the school. I saw that she was happy, confident and at ease with adults. That’s what I wanted my little girl to be, and now she is also.
I believe that St. Anne’s School of Annapolis provides my children with an exceptional learning experience in a safe and secure environment. They are learning beyond the basics of education, as well as how to be good citizens and productive members of society with an understanding of compassion and empathy. I couldn’t ask for much more than that.
I like the sense of security and trust that the schools gives to me when my children are there; the knowledge that my children are getting an incredible education; and knowing that they are building wonderful memories on which they will reflect for the rest of their lives."
--Elaine Pavlick
"St. Anne's School has created a nurturing environment in which students and teachers have what they need to grow: respect, encouragement and high expectations."
---Sigrid Murphy
"When I think of the type of persons I want my children to be as adults: honest, caring and generous individuals who strive to learn, I am so grateful to be at St. Anne's School where these same values are lived out in the classroom. And while the academic instruction is evident I hear it in my sons' dialogue at home our children are not so much being taught, as they are learning to learn. The teachers at St. Anne's School are professionals; professional instructors, professional nurturers, and professional learners. They set the example of community that is so essential to our children's well-being and growth. The foundation of this community comes from the leadership, the Head of School and parent leaders, who set the exceptionally high standard for the school. As parents, it is our responsibility to support and strengthen this foundation and the St. Anne's School community as well."
---Haley and Jamie DeMaria
"My three daughters attended St. Anne's School preschool and I started teaching there as a long term sub and then stayed on the following year. I searched many preschools for my girls and I fell in love with St. Anne's School. What keeps me here: The talented, diverse staff is very exciting to me, not only are they my colleagues, but my close friends. I have been here for 15 years and I love the families. I have had the privilege of teaching many sibs and I have also been able to watch many of my students move on through high school and now beyond!"
---Anne Egan
"We were initially attracted to St. Anne's School as a result of a clear connection we felt to its Mission Statement. Our initial meetings with some of the leadership team at the school reinforced our belief that they actually "lived the mission." We continue to be thankful that we made the choice to enroll our child at St. Anne¹s School as they have delivered on everything they promised: a focus on the "whole child" where they integrate academic, social, leadership, and community service skills into their learning methodology; a curriculum and stimulating learning environment that fosters critical thinking; a focus on professional development; teachers who apply the latest proven research on child development and learning; and a school community that is committed to excellence. We believe St. Anne's School is preparing our child to "live a life of consequence." We couldn't ask for more than that."
---Kurt Kroemer
"I'd love to thank every single teacher for preparing me so well for high school! You have no idea how helpful the Capstone Project was for writing my papers. I have about one a week and I don't know how I would handle them if I didn't have that guidance through my first research paper."
--- Class of '11 Alum
"St. Anne's is committed to transforming lives and building community. In the tradition of Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, St. Anne's School strives to BE the change we want to see in our world. St. Anne's sees itself as a laboratory for the development of an equitable and just community, where learning to live compassionately and respectfully with others is as important as academic achievement."
---The Rt. Rev. Eugene Taylor Sutton, Bishop of Maryland

President Barack Obama blew through Denver during a snowstorm Thursday afternoon to boost Sen. Michael Bennet’s re-election campaign, part of a skip across the West to help vulnerable candidates, The Denver Post reports. The president stumped for the rookie Democratic senator in front of about 2,700 people packed into Fillmore Auditorium, then cruised through town in his motorcade to a cocktail fundraiser at the downtown Sheraton.
In other coverage:
Mike Littwin, The Denver Post: If you want an idea just how toxic things are in Washington these days, all you had to do was take a trip to Denver. As you’ve probably seen, Jane Norton welcomed Barack Obama to town by cutting her first TV ad, calling on Obama — who may not have seen the ad — to balance the budget or not run for re-election in 2012.
The Denver Daily News: President Barack Obama’s fundraising visit to Denver yesterday in support of U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet came with its fair share of controversy and protest. From medical marijuana advocates who want to stop raids on growers, to conservatives who questioned the cost of Obama’s visit to Denver, the picket lines were colorful yesterday afternoon outside the Fillmore Auditorium where Obama spoke.
Bloomberg: President Barack Obama is emphasizing his administration’s actions on the economy during a two-state Western state swing that comes as he’s trying to bolster the chances of Democrats in November’s elections. The president plans to announce today in Las Vegas $1.5 billion in funding for housing finance agencies in states where the average prices for homes have fallen more than 20 percent from their peak, according to an administration fact sheet.
Politico:.
San Francisco Examiner: Complaining that America has grown “numb” from “slash and burn politics,” President Obama urged Democrats here to keep faith with the party and ignore the noise from Washington. Back in full-throated campaign mode, Obama is on a two-day swing through the West trying to shore up a pair of his party’s embattled Senate incumbents.
Los Angeles Times: Looking to galvanize Democrats, President Barack, the president invoked a famous phrase from Truman’s come-from-behind bid to stay in the White House in 1948.
The Denver Post: Text of Obama’s Denver remarks.

I’ve often pondered what Las Vegas would be like if it were a soundless black-and-white scene. Without the sensory stimulant, I imagine that there would be less inclination to shell out money in the Spartan atmosphere.
The same goes for financial institutions. Imagine a bank unadorned with gilded handrails and polished wood veneer to impress people with the air of professionalism.
They’re really just a Vegas-like facade broadcasting, “Invest your money here; we know what we are doing.” But do they?
Last week, Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty to charges against his notorious ponzi scheme, which will likely be chiseled into the history books as a central theme of the current economic crisis. His role as an insider taking advantage of investors’ confidence for his own benefit has been a recurring story that is stirring an angry public sentiment.
In addition, last Thursday’s “Daily Show” on Comedy Central pitted host Jon Stewart against CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer in what was hyped up to be a funny feud between MBAs and the layman. But what aired was what The New York Times later described as a “cathartic ritual of indignation and castigation” of CNBC, and to a greater extent, Wall Street.
Stewart’s bold and relentless attacks peaked when he flatly chastised, “I understand you want to make finance entertaining, but it’s not a f--king game.”
And that is where he touched on my central point: It’s Americans who have been treating finance as a game, which many have now lost and are looking for reasons.
Well, I have one reason: Americans substituted the principles of investing for those of gambling.
Wall Street is not the Vegas Strip, so stop placing bets there. I’ve often heard people say that investing is a gamble — sometimes they win and sometimes they lose. The idea, however, is completely wrong, and I want to make it clear to everyone that the two are not the same.
Here’s the distinction: A sport better assesses a team’s statistical odds, analyzes components and maybe goes with a gut instinct that finally comes together in the form of a bet on the outcome.
An investor, on the other hand, assesses a team, analyzes its components and then makes a decision to sponsor its season, thus providing capital the team can use to perform better.
Pensions, futures, 401k, stocks and bonds are all rooted in sound principles of trade, not gambling. As soon as one thinks they’re gambling their capital, they must in turn forfeit the proper right to complain when the value sinks.
Though it’s sad that many people have been blindsided by dubious practices and have seen their savings and investments deteriorate, the rule remains that everyone must perform their due diligence in managing their investments.
Stewart was right for asking when Americans are “going to realize … that our wealth is work?” Investing is not a crapshoot, a slot machine or a horse race; it’s a real-time market with active trading.
Anyone who treats it like a casino with mindless bets or intuition will have house odds.
And today, seeing the executives of failed banks run away with millions, I can’t help but think that the house won.

Alonso, Sounders hand Rapids 6th straight loss
COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (AP) Eddie Johnson and Osvaldo Alonso are displaying the talent that made them MLS All-Stars.
Johnson scored in the opening minute on Saturday night and assisted on Alonso's goal in the 66th minute to lift the Seattle Sounders to a 2-1 victory over Colorado and send the Rapids to their sixth straight loss.
"Eddie had a big header for a goal and made a key pass on out other goal," Seattle coach Sigi Schmid said. "Alonso's goal showed why he deserved to be an All-Star."
Seattle (9-5-7) is 2-0-3 in its past five games.
"That win meant more than winning the All-Star game, a game that's more for the fans," Johnson said. "This was all about winning for Seattle Sounders."
Drew Moor scored his third goal of the season in the 3rd minute for Colorado (7-14-1). The Rapids have been outscored 11-3 during their skid.
The Rapids held a lengthy closed-door meeting after the loss.
"We are embarrassed," Colorado coach Oscar Pareja said. "Our fans deserve more than this."
On the tiebreaking goal, Alonso got free of midfielder Wells Thompson, took Johnson's cross, and buried a shot past goalkeeper Matt Pickens for his first goal.
"It all began with great patience by Alex Caskey and then good movement by Eddie," Schmid said. "We finished it off by getting the big goal by Alonso, a player who has done well with previous clubs."
The Sounders have won the teams' first three meetings this year, while allowing just two goals, and have beaten the Rapids six straight times.
"The key was we wanted ball possession and not having to chase them," Schmid said. "We got off to the good start thanks to Eddie's goal, but gave them one right back."
Pickens was denied his 40th career win with the Rapids. He shares the franchise record of 39 wins.
Moor came right back for the Rapids Brian Mullan worked himself free to the left of Seattle goalkeeper Michael Gspurning. Mullan sent a cross to the opposite wing, and Moor beat Gspurning with a header.
Gspurning stopped a scoring chance by Conor Casey with a sliding two-handed catch in the 15th. Johnson put a low drive on goal and denied a second goal by Pickens in the 24th.
Casey had two chances to tie the game for Colorado. He missed the left post with a header in the 70th. Gspurning made a desperate save to stop an ankle high shot by Casey in the 77th.
"He made a good shot," Gspurning said. "I stayed low to the ground and made a good save."

Suns-Trail Blazers Preview
By MATT BEARDMORE
(AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers and Phoenix Suns are both riding season-high four-game winning streaks.
If Portland is going to extend its run - and post its seventh consecutive home win in this matchup - on Saturday night, it might have to do so without LaMarcus Aldridge.
Since falling 98-80 to Sacramento on Dec. 8 to open a season-high six-game homestand, the Trail Blazers (12-12) have regrouped to climb back to the break-even point.
Portland, though, might be without Aldridge, averaging a team-best 21.0 points with 8.0 rebounds, for a second straight game after he rolled his ankle late in Sunday's 95-94 victory over New Orleans. Nicolas Batum scored 22, Wesley Matthews added 20 and J.J. Hickson posted his sixth consecutive double-double with 18 and 18 rebounds in Thursday's 101-93 win over Denver, but the Blazers yielded 74 points in the paint without their big man.
"That was tough, but hopefully I'll play tomorrow," Aldridge said on Friday after going through a light workout.
If he doesn't, Hickson is confident that the Blazers can continue their winning ways.
"We all took it upon ourselves individually to step up and not do anything out of the ordinary, but just do a little bit more and it would make up for him not playing," he said.
With Hickson sidelined (left shoulder sprain), Aldridge did not fare well against center Marcin Gortat and the Suns' frontcourt in a 114-87 loss at Phoenix on Nov. 21. Aldridge finished with a season-low 12 points and seven rebounds in that contest, while Gortat had 22 points and seven boards in three quarters of work.
The Suns, who shot a season-best 59.7 percent in that contest, made 51.2 percent of their shots in a 104-92 preseason victory over the Blazers on Oct. 12.
"I don't know (why we've struggled against them)," said rookie guard Damian Lillard, who led Portland with 24 points in last month's game. "When we play them, they just make shots. We played them at their place both times and they're one of those teams that play really well at home."
Phoenix (11-15), though, has lost its last five away from home and was routed 109-71 - the Suns' most lopsided defeat of 2011-12 - in its last game at Portland on Jan. 27.
However, the Suns are hoping to build off a 4-1 homestand that ended with Wednesday's 121-104 victory over Charlotte. Phoenix set season highs for points, 3-pointers (17) and assists (31).
"The ball was circling around, everybody got their touches and we were making shots," point guard Goran Dragic told the Suns' official website after scoring 21 points with a season-high 11 assists. "SB (Shannon Brown) was huge tonight (with five 3s and a season-best 26 points) and our defense was solid."
The Suns, who last won five straight from Jan. 12-21, 2011, are holding teams to 89.5 points per game during their current surge.
The Blazers are surrendering 87.8 per contest since their last defeat.
The home team has won the last four matchups between these teams. Those games have been decided by 25, 38, 18 and 27 points.

Use 100 random numbers was produced according to the following specifications: Numbers were randomly selected from within the range of 0 to 99999. Duplicate numbers were allowed. This table was generated on 5/18/2013.?
Although no computer algorithm can produce numbers that are truly
random, Stat Trek's Random Number Generator produces numbers that are nearly
random. Stat Trek's Random Number Generator can be used for most statistical
applications (like randomly assigning subjects to treatments in a statistical
experiment). However, it should not be used to generate numbers for
cryptography. minimum and maximum values set limits on the range of values
that might appear in a random number table. The minimum value identifies the
smallest number in the range; and the maximum value identifies the largest
number. For example, if we set the minimum value equal to 12 and the maximum
value equal to 30, the Random Number Generator will produce a table consisting
of random arrangements of the numbers in the range of 12 to 30.
What does it mean to allow duplicate
entries in a random number table?
Stat Trek's Random Number Generator allows Users to permit or
prevent the same number from appearing more than once in the random number
table. To permit duplicate entries, set the drop-down box labeled "Allow
duplicate entries" equal to True. To prevent duplicate entries, change the
setting to False.
Essentially, allowing duplicate entries amounts to
sampling
with replacement;
preventing duplicate entries amounts to
sampling
without replacement.
What is a seed?
The seed is a number that controls whether the Random Number
Generator produces a new set of random numbers or repeats a particular sequence
of random numbers. If the text box labeled "Seed" is blank, the Random Number
Generator will produce a different set of random numbers each time a
random number table is created. On the other hand, if a number is entered in
the "Seed" text box, the Random Number Generator will produce a set of random
numbers based on the value of the Seed. Each time a random number table is
created, the Random Number Generator will produce the same set of
random numbers, until the Seed value is changed.
Note: The ability of the seed to repeat a random
sequence of numbers assumes that changes 1/7/2012.

Editor.
How different mothers are from other folks! Our mother didn't care anything about going around. She'd rather stay at home and work. She was never so happy as when cleaning up the house and bathing babies and washing dishes and baking cake in the hot old kitchen -- cakes for the rest of us to eat.
When the family went riding, if there wasn't enough room for everybody (and there never was), Mother didn't go. She'd rather stay at home, anyhow. Somebody had to stay there.
Now that she's gone, and we've grown up and know a little more than we used to, the accusing truth bobs up. Most certainly she would have enjoyed the rides with the rest; she found no physical refreshment in bending over the hot oven baking cakes for us to eat if they were good and turn up our noses if they weren't; nor did washing dishes and bathing babies and cleaning up the house rest her tired body. She was human. But she was unselfish. She'd rather see us enjoy a good time than to have a little fun herself; she'd rather do the hard, hot work than watch any of the rest of us do it. Doing for other was HER pleasure. What a wonder Mother was!
We remember, too, how we couldn't understand why mother preferred the neck of the chicken to any other part, because we didn't like the neck and none of the rest of the children seemed to care for the neck. But that was what Mother always took for herself. We know now. The only way she could make the chicken go around and not have any one of us feel mean and selfish was for her to take the neck. But we didn't wake up until after she had gone to heaven.
Look here, son, is your mother eating any chicken necks to give you the best things in life? You bet she is. Her whole life has been spent sacrificing for you. She thinks you're perfect, and she won't let anybody say you are not. She loves you; and if you never notice her again as long as she lives, she'll die loving her boy. Now, you go to her today and put your arms around her neck and kiss her lots and lots of times and tell her just how much you owe her for all she's done for you and how much you love her just because she is what she is -- the most wonderful thing in the world --Your Mother.

141 Tasting Notes.
Tastes like dried spinach – too vegetal for me. I added some cream and honey, which helped, but it still wasn’t very good. One of the few Twinings teas I don’t like. On the bright side, better than Lipton or Tetley..
After my experience with Numi’s Emperor Puerh, I was not predisposed to like this tea, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was distracted, and let this oversteep, but it did not ruin the tea. The puerh flavor was present, but the earthiness complemented the cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon flavors. The dominant flavor was chocolate, but it was not just like having a hot cocoa. The earthiness of the puerh made it a different drink, and it also didn’t taste like watered down hot chocolate that some chocolate teas taste like.
This.
This tea has a pleasant earthy taste that is also somewhat malty. The earthiness reminds me of the puerh I tried, except that this is much more pleasant. Not my favorite, and I probably wouldn’t buy it again, but pleasant enough.
Not bad, but not great. I don’ care for the combination: smoky Keemun together with the sweeter Ceylon. The two flavors compete rather than blend.
This.
As soon as I removed the plastic wrapper from the box, the orange scent wafted out of it, even though the bags were individually wrapped. The flavor tastes like mandarin oranges, sweet but with a slight bitter aftertaste, rather than regular oranges. I added a teaspoon of orange blossom honey to sweeten it. The longer I drink it, however, the less I care for it. It is too one-dimensional in its orange flavor. I would rather have the orange flavor paired with a rich black tea that would give it some depth.
About half way through the cup I tired of the flavor, so I added some more hot water and a ceylon teabag and let it steep awhile longer. The orange flavor was muted but at the same time brought out the citrus in the ceylon. I will have to try this again using the two different bags from the beginning.
Wonderful.
I made a second steeping of the leaves, and the tea was weaker, though with the same ceylon flavor. I was a little disappointed at the weaker flavor and at not being able to get multiple steepings out of these leaves, but it is still a good cup.
I!
Strong..
This.
I definitely do not care for this tea. Tastes like dirt to me. I suppose the term should be “earthy,” but dirt works for me. It tastes somewhat like a watered down version of Numi’s Emperor Puerh I tried the other day, though it doesn’t have the fishy flavor.
The.
The flavor was weak, even after six minutes of steeping. Adding honey helped bring out the peach flavor, though the ginger was still faint. After that the flavor was acceptable, but I wouldn’t rush out to buy this tea.
I.
My!
Another sample from “Numi’s Collection.” The moment you open the bag, the vanilla aroma comes out strong. I steeped the bag for the full five minutes, and added half and half and sweetener, which brought out the flavor and enhanced the creamy texture. The vanilla tastes natural, as it should, since they used vanilla beans, not artificial flavoring. With the half and half, it tastes like melted haagen-dasz vanilla ice cream. From all the bad reviews and from trying other Numi teas this morning, I was thinking I would dislike this tea, but I am pleasantly surprised.
<|endofexample|>
ehhhh, not as good as Teaopia. (minus serious points!)
There’s something missing, that certain malty depth that makes tea so satisfying for me. It’s smoky, but still weak. I almost wonder how this one would taste with milk(minus points). The teaopia one was just fine on its own but I had to add some agave here(minus points!!)…
Not much else to say about this one, not when I’ve had so much better. If it wasn’t for that I think this would get maybe five extra points from me.
EDIT: ok so I may have been quick to judge… I tried this with milk and it’s a bit better. Bumping it a few notches. The Teaopia version would be terrible with milk so I assumed the same for this one!
ehhhh, not as good as Teaopia. (minus serious points!)
I use this in everything I cook. My wife calls it our “Frank’s Red Hot”. Anyhoo, I recently made a potato soup with this and it is amazing. Completely out of this world. It tastes like a loaded baked potato soup with bacon, but there’s no actual bacon in it! I don’t drink this tea, but if you’re looking for a way to add a lot of flavor to cooking without adding sodium or calories, this is definitely one to keep around!
…I sound like an ad >.>
i agree with you, IB, there is definitely something missing with this version of the tea. the malty depth is a good way to describe what’s missing. thanks!
heh, glad I could help Amanda! :)
I find it a bit scratchy to. Like I need to clear my throat constantly.

This story appeared in Indian Country Today in March 2012.
Past and future national elections cast shadows over a Native-American voting-rights lawsuit argued in Rapid City, South Dakota, on March 8. At the end of the all-day hearing, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier noted that the state and county officials who were defendants in the suit had already voluntarily promised to do everything the Oglala Lakota plaintiffs had requested for this year’s national election.
For the first time, the plaintiffs will be able to early-vote in their own county during a 46-day period leading up to the June primary and November general election, just like other South Dakotans. The plaintiffs originally had just 6 days, which their suit called “a denial of the right to vote” and “discriminatory.” But with their early voting access now assured for 2012, the request for a preliminary injunction ordering exactly that was moot, Judge Scheier declared.
However, the judge noted, the defendants had merely made “representations and promises” to provide equal voting rights in 2012. If they do not carry out these plans, she announced to the court, “bring that to my attention, and I would grant the preliminary injunction.”
The judge also found that the plaintiffs’ other request—for a permanent injunction against future inequalities—remains a “live claim.” In her March 14 opinion, she wrote that because of as-yet-unsolved financial issues, “There is a reasonable expectation that plaintiffs will be subject to the same conduct in the next election cycle, or that the conduct will recur.”
Judge Schreier ended the hearing by saying that registering to vote and casting ballots—both during the early-voting period and on election day—were fundamental rights: “All of our citizens in South Dakota should have equal access.” She commended the counties for “taking steps” to ensure this for 2012, adding, “I wish they had be taken in earlier elections, but at least you’re taking those steps now.”
Clarice Mesteth was one of several Oglala Lakota plaintiffs who attended the hearing. She was pleased at its outcome, she said: “The defendants are not off the hook. They’re accountable for their actions not just this year, but forever.”
Nevertheless, Mesteth was disturbed at Oglalas’ continual, election-after-election struggle for equal enfranchisement, saying, “It seems like everyone wants to make us squirm before they let us vote.”
“The judge has given all parties time to find a lasting, sustainable fix for the funding problems in Shannon County,” said Greg Lembrich, legal director of Four Directions, a voting-rights nonprofit, and senior associate at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. “There has to be some way the state can ensure that all South Dakota’s citizens are guaranteed their constitutional right to vote.”
Shannon and Fall River counties’ attorney, Sara Frankenstein, said she is doing just that—working with her clients to find long-term funding for Shannon County elections. “The next thing I need is information from South Dakota’s secretary of state about the state’s Help America Vote Act funds—how much there are, how they’re transferred, how we satisfy the federal accounting rules governing them.” She added that Shannon County officials are also trying to discover whether it might be eligible for PILT funds (Payment in Lieu of Taxes, which the Department of the Interior disburses to local entities to make up for financial losses due to non-taxable federally-owned land, such as national parks, within their borders).
Genesis of a lawsuit
The Oglala Lakota lawsuit arose after Shannon County decided in January 2012 that leading up to this year’s primary and general elections, it could afford to give its residents only six days of in-county early voting for each—as opposed to requiring them to drive as many as 200 miles round trip to another county. (Shannon County is roughly contiguous with the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and responsible for national elections there; it is not a tribal entity, but rather a subdivision of the state of South Dakota.) According to Shannon County commissioner Lyla Hutchison, the county was “simply out of money.”
South Dakota’s head election official, Secretary of State Jason Gant, refused to advance cash-poor Shannon County Help America Vote Act funds, saying reimbursement after the elections, backed up by receipts, was state policy. The reimbursement requirement is not federal policy, according to Bryan Whitener of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which administers the federal law, but rather something states may decide to do. A stalemate ensued: Shannon County couldn’t front the money for full elections, so its voters had to make do with less ballot-box access.
Early voting has not been consistently available in Native American areas since South Dakota first began offering this convenient way to cast ballots in 2004. Typically, Shannon County residents have had a fraction of the days offered other South Dakotans, or none at all. When early voting has been provided within Native communities, as many as 46% of voters have used it, driving up election participation, according to O.J. Semans, Sicangu Lakota director of Four Directions. Just 15 days of early voting in 2004 doubled the election turnout over 2000, when it was not available, Semans said.
When it became clear in early 2012 that Shannon County/Pine Ridge would yet again have less early voting than other parts of the state, 25 tribal members called on attorney Steven D. Sandven, of Sioux Falls, to sue Gant, along with officials of both Shannon County and adjacent Fall River County, which handles elections on a freelance basis for Shannon County’s barebones government.
The lawsuit cited the protections of the U.S. and South Dakota constitutions, the Voting Rights Act and other measures. As a voting-rights case, the issue was stark, Sandven said: “Six days versus 46.”
The suit joined the 20-plus that Native Americans and their advocates have brought in South Dakota since the 1980s, winning cases that charged gerrymandering, demands for forms of ID that are not required, failure to provide sufficient polling places, purging of qualified voters from the rolls and intimidation, according to American Civil Liberties Union reports. On the morning of the 2004 general election, for example, a judge stopped poll watchers from following American Indian voters out of voting precincts and taking down their license-plate numbers.
For decades, South Dakota has flamboyantly asserted its position on enfranchisement. Native people didn’t vote there until the 1940s, even though the Indian Citizenship Act gave them that right in 1924. During the 1970s, a state attorney general called the Voting Rights Act an “absurdity” and advised the secretary of state at the time to ignore it. Prior to the 2002 election, the state sent agents to Indian reservations to question newly registered voters and root out alleged voter fraud; no one was ever charged.
This history of discrimination makes two South Dakota counties—Shannon and nearby Todd, which is contiguous with the Rosebud Indian Reservation—subject to special Department of Justice oversight, including “preclearance” of any voting laws it passes. In 2005, a federal court found that the state had managed to avoid preclearance of more than 700 laws.
Money, money, money!
In an 11th-hour reversal just ahead of the March 8, 2012 hearing, state and county officials announced they’d found money to pay for early voting in Shannon County.
Both Shannon and Fall River counties, as well as the state of South Dakota, have long stressed that early-voting inequities were all about money, not an attempt to constrain Native American voters, who are typically heavily Democratic in a Republican-controlled state. However, during the March 8 hearing, startling testimony from Semans revealed that during a Shannon County commissioners’ meeting prior to the 2010 election, his organization offered to donate $11,000 to pay for the upcoming early-voting period in Shannon County.
Consideration of the offer was interrupted by a dramatic announcement by Fall River officials, as they returned to the meeting from a break and tendered 30-day notices of resignation from their Shannon County freelance gigs (though not their Fall River jobs). In the succeeding brouhaha, no one ever contacted Four Directions for the $11,000, Semans testified.
The looming exit of the Fall River officials jeopardized Shannon County’s 2010 election, including registration and early voting, and other essential government services—possibilities the Rapid City Journal covered repeatedly and colorfully in succeeding weeks. Headlines included “Shannon County officials resigning in 30 days,” “Shannon County residents have a lot to lose,” “Limbo continues for Shannon County” and “Shannon County running amok.”
On the stand before Judge Schreier in 2012, Fall River State’s Attorney Jim Sword testified that the 2010 resignations—including his and the election official’s notices—had nothing to do with early voting but were in fact the fault of the “malicious” Department of Justice, which had been scrutinizing Fall River’s conduct of Shannon County elections.
Months before, Sword had written to the Justice Department threatening to resign if another voting-rights suit were filed, he testified. “[Giving notice] had nothing to do with early voting. Had everything to do with their malicious actions,” Sword responded to a question from Frankenstein. “It’s always been a response to threats to sue us.”
What about 2012?, Frankenstein asked. “There’s nothing to indicate that this won’t be anything but a great election,” Sword replied.
Secretary of State Gant offered some surprises—for example, testifying that for several months he’d sat on information about Shannon County’s struggle to put together a 2012 election. The next was when he confirmed under questioning from the judge that the state has millions in its HAVA-fund coffers. Meanwhile, an election in Shannon County appears to cost somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000.
Yet another was when Gant testified that South Dakota law allows the state to step in and run elections when necessary. Back in 2010, Fall River officials created such turmoil when they headed for the door because then-Secretary of State Chris Nelson refused to involve the state, telling the Rapid City Journal, “the state will not step in and run the election” and “no one but a county auditor can manage an election.” At press time, neither Secretary Gant nor his lawyer had responded to requests for comments.
Looking forward
Tribal members in Shannon County deserve a permanent solution to the early-voting problem, said Laughlin McDonald, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project and author of an amicus brief supporting the Oglala plaintiffs: “They should be treated like voters in other counties in South Dakota. The long and continuing history of disparate treatment of American Indian voters in South Dakota should come to an end.”
McDonald described the hoped-for result of all this—increased American Indian political participation in the state—as “helping break down the barriers that continue to separate Indians and non-Indians” and conferring “undeniable benefits.”
Lembrich has provided practical examples of the benefits of Native enfranchisement in South Dakota, despite its limitations so far: “Water projects have been expanded to bring running water to many rural Indian communities, and attempts to cut funding for tribal colleges were defeated.” He also noted that the simple fact of bringing the suit means “everyone now knows the threat of a federal lawsuit is real and not just a bluff.”
What made Semans especially happy, he said, was the judge noting Native Americans’ long-term fight for equal voting rights in South Dakota. “That effort gave us a foothold that led to this success today,” Semans said. “We got kicked to the curb a few times along the way, and it took eight years, and it was worth it.”

I’d argue that Brooklyn’s Woods have quietly assembled a near-flawless discography over the past five years, and based on what little we’ve heard of the forthcoming Bend Beyond, their streak is set to continue. The first single from the album, “Cali In A Cup,” debuted last month, and now we get “Size Meets The Sound,” a blissful rush of sun-baked psychedelia. (Off-topic: lots of alliteration in these titles, right? Is that a thing?) Anyway, tune in, turn on, drop out:

I’m a hijacker.
I was listening to a podcast by Tullian Tchividjian called “Jesus + Nothing = Everything.” In it, he described how even our spiritual growth efforts can become self-centered by taking the focus off who God IS and making it about what we do.
The intent of spiritual growth is to build our relationship with God, but I’ll confess that sometimes I find myself hijacking it for my own glory. I’m not nearly as interested in spiritual “growth” as I am in gaining spiritual “knowledge” to add to my “spiritual” arsenal or to expand the “spiritual” facade I hold up for others to see. Wow! Did that make any sense? What I meant is this: Instead of being motivated to “grow” toward God, I am motivated by selfishness to make myself look like I’ve “grown” toward God. Sinful. That’s what it is. I’m sinful. I need Jesus to rescue my attempts at spiritual growth. I’m so sick that I need Jesus to keep me from tainting the very practices that guide me toward Him. True spiritual growth efforts are motivated by the greatness of God which moves us to seek Him. Often, my efforts are motivated out of a desire to know more than my friend’s know – out of a selfish “I’m more spiritual” attitude.
I will also confess that I love the way I feel when I go to another “level” or “spiritual” high. Even a new tidbit of information or insight about the Bible is enough to make me feel like I have “grown.” My insatiable desire for more doesn’t allow me to fully rest in Jesus’ effort on the cross. This is sinful. I wrongfully believe my efforts and knowledge about Scripture is what matters. It’s NOT! What matters is God’s character. NOT the things I do, but the things He IS. What matters is the cross! Because of who He IS, He chose to go to the cross. And because of that, I am already close to Him. Even when I seek spiritual “growth” with selfish motivations, even in the midst of my sin, He died for me. He loves me fully! Right where I am He loves me. He . . . . . loves . . . . . me.
God should be glorified. Completely glorified. ‘Cause He’s great and we are not. He is faithful. He is love. He is amazing! Loving each of us no matter how sick we are. He is so out of our league. We can never understand how great He is – how great His love is. His ways are so much higher than ours. (Is 55:8-9)
I guess what I’m saying is that this hijacker wants to return this glory back to it’s rightful owner.
To God be the Glory forever, and ever, AMEN!.

What a start by the Redbirds! 9-3…and it doesn’t even feel like we broke a sweat getting there. This team may be looking for several pieces of their identity to emerge, but it’s already clear that “relentless” and “determined” are words that will consistently be applied to the 2012 Cardinals.
But we have a lot to talk about, so let’s get into it (if you haven’t listened to the UCB Radio Hour from last night yet, CLICK_HERE).
About that start by Adam Wainwright on Opening Day… I really feel for the fans who worked themselves into a frenzy in anticipation of this Opening Day – with Waino starting and all – but we really should have seen this coming. His start against the Brewers was less than inspiring. He held his own, but he didn’t exactly have shutdown stuff. Most are attributing his lack of success so far to reduced velocity – a malady the experts claim will heal with time – but it’s also clear he just needs more starts to get comfortable again. And let’s not forget, Mr. Tommy John himself – Chris Carpenter – warned fans and media to temper expectations during Winter Warm-Up. “Cy Young Adam Wainwright,” as Carp called him, may take some time to establish himself. Again, according to Carp, he’s 100% healthy and ready to go – or else he wouldn’t be throwing – but it just takes time and multiple starts to get right. He’ll get there.
What the heck was up with no Clydesdales?! I know, I know…the warning track was wet and stuff. So what. The next day, the Cardinals had the ring ceremony and then delayed the start of the game by nearly a couple hours. Why not do that on Opening Day to fix the track? Is it impossible to fix the track after horses walk on it before the game? I may sound unreasonable, but not having the Clydesdales on Opening Day in St. Louis is just…well…wrong! I feel like the Cardinals and AB need to make this right…maybe with a Clydesdales Day in Busch this season. They could partner with Build-A-Bear to give away mini plush horses…or something. And it really galls me that Luhnow had the Clydesdales at Opening Day in Houston this year…and we didn’t. Back off our traditions, Draft Boy!!!
I absolutely loved the gold jerseys worn by the Cardinals. If you didn’t see it, the players wore special uniforms with gold lettering during the first two home games of the weekend against the Cubs. I wouldn’t want to see them the entire year, but it was fun to see for a few days. In fact…hehehe…I bought a David Freese gold-letter shirsey last week
Boo-yah!
And while we’re on the subject of Championship swag…how ‘bout them rings, eh?! Like the hosts last night, I am thoroughly impressed with the design of the World Series Championship rings given to the players this year. Including details such as a “Happy Flight” inscription and the rally squirrel will make them conversation and story pieces for decades.
Tara came up with an excellent plan for delivering Albert Pujols and Colby Rasmus their rings last night! I believe she said, “Let’s ship ‘em to a random address in Iceland and then send Albert and Colby notes that say ‘Here’s where it is…go get it.’” Outstanding idea, Tara! And I understand your father deserves creative credit as well…so be it. So let it be written…so let it be done!
Was Game 162 on September 28th a sign of things to come for the Cardinals? After doing everything but dominating their division and season for the 161 games prior, the Cardinals handily won their final game against the Astros 8-0. None of the other teams participating in that historic night of games can say anything even close to that. The Red Sox and Braves blew it…the Rays squeeked in…and it took the Phillies multiple tries to pull off an extra inning win. But Carp and the Cardinals cruised to a calm victory in Texas. Maybe we should have seen what happened in October as inevitable.
Speaking of Game 162 and Paul Kocak’s book, A+E Home Entertainment and MLB Productions should produce and distribute a DVD collection of those games. I would love to see a five or six disc set that included each of the four games involved in that night in their entirety as well as one or two extra bonus discs for extras. One of the bonus discs could even contain a dramatic, specially produced showing of the games mixed together as they happened with or without commentary. The other disc could be devoted to turning Kocak’s book into a film documentary to show the fan’s perspective. Let’s call it, “3 Minutes in September”
Paul brought up an excellent point about technology and Social Media serving to distract from the game. I love to get on Twitter during games, but even I find myself shutting it down for special moments like Opening Day or World Series games. I just don’t want to be distracted from appreciating what’s unfolding in front of me. Even instant replay and DVR technology as spoiled me a bit. Have you ever found yourself missing something in your life – maybe a funny moment between friends, or a cute smile by your children – and instinctively reaching for the DVR/Replay button? I know it sounds silly…but I have. Especially if I miss something on the radio! I’ve grown so accustomed to “never really missing anything” that I worry I take special moments for granted.
A final note about the drama of that night…Game 162 on September 28th: The drama and Hollywood format that it set up for October was, in a word, unbelievable. For example, I have no doubt in my mind that the Phillies would have beaten any other NL foe except for the Cardinals – especially the Braves. It took a special kind of mojo for that STL team to prevail. And yet Game 162 found the Phillies fighting tooth and nail to set in motion their own demise! By beating the Braves and gifting the Cardinals a playoff spot, the Phillies signed their own death warrant. They made “11 in 11” possible. Unreal.
Paul Kocak mentioned Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians on last night’s show. His question was a simple one. Since Doby integrated the American League shortly after Jackie Robinson did the National League, should the AL have a Larry Doby day while the NL has a Jackie Robinson day? My initial reaction was, “Eh…I don’t know.” I thought that one of the reasons Robinson was so special was not simply because he played, but because he played extremely well. Knowing nothing about Doby’s career, I instantly assumed it was less than stellar. I was wrong. Looking up Doby’s stats on Baseball-Reference.com, it became clear Doby is deserving of celebration. In a 13 year career (really, just over 12…he didn’t exactly play much in his first season), Doby hit .283/.386/.490 with 253 home runs and nearly 1,000 RBIs. He averaged 27 home runs and 103 RBIs a season and hit 32 homers twice – 1952 and 1954. Fifty-four, in fact, was possibly his best year with 32 homers, 126 RBIs, and a slash line of .272/.364/.484. Years later, the slugger was voted to the Hall of Fame by the Veteran’s Committee. Well-deserved, Larry. But to get back to Paul’s point, Jackie debuted for the Dodgers on April 15th, 1947. Doby debuted months later on July 5th, 1947…the same year. Should Doby be given his own day like Jackie? I would love to see it happen in the AL…but Jackie has become such a symbol throughout baseball, I don’t think it would be possible – nor should it – to replace Jackie’s day in the AL with Larry’s day. Baseball may need to get creative and offer something in addition to Jackie Robinson Day to honor Larry – and others – during an MLB season.
Wrap-Up!
That’ll do it for today! Thanks for reading, and don’t forget…today’s an early day game, and Waino faces the Reds.
GO CARDS!!!

• Jim Hickey and his teammates from St. Anthony's Hospital -- Joe Ciaccio, Jeff Weitholter, Eric Garateix and Bill Ulbricht -- shot 55 to win first place in Monday's Rays Charity Golf Tournament, held at the Ritz-Carlton Members Golf Club in Sarasota. Jake McGee won bragging rights in the Rays' clubhouse by winning the longest drive contest.
• The Rays put in some work on situational hitting at Tuesday's workout. Maddon noted that any time he wants to emphasize something, he'll put it in early in camp "to get the thoughts rolling."
• Maddon spoke highly of Jake Odorizzi's "ability to throw the ball where he wants to," noting that the right-hander acquired from the Royals in the Shields trade had a simple delivery and a good makeup.
"He's very interesting," said Maddon.

CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Roy Halladay threw a bullpen session on Wednesday at Bright House Field, which seemed to go OK.
"Roy threw very well," pitching coach.
Halladay is scheduled to pitch in a Minor League Spring Training game Saturday at Carpenter Complex. He would get one more start before he is scheduled to pitch April 3 against the Braves in Atlanta.
The veteran right-hander has had a rough month. Halladay looked fine in his first two Grapefruit League starts, throwing his fastball in the 89-91 mph range. But his velocity has dropped since then. In Halladay's third Grapefruit League start, his velocity fell into the 86-88 mph range, and he talked afterward about experiencing "dead arm." He got roughed up for seven runs over 2 2/3 innings in his fourth start March 12, saying he felt lethargic. Then Halladay lasted just one inning in his fifth start Sunday because of the stomach virus.
The Phillies have said repeatedly that Halladay has no physical issues. They said some of his struggles stem from mechanical issues, which they have been working on.

TORONTO — Ever since Lillian Gish and D.W. Griffith joined forces on dozens of silent classics, film history has been filled with notable actress-director teams who conjured magic multiple times.
A real-life romance can kindle such cinematic couplings: Woody Allen with Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. Ingmar Bergman with Liv Ullmann. Tim Burton with Helena Bonham Carter.
Then there are platonic partnerships between artists who are sublimely simpatico: Josef von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich. George Cukor and Katharine Hepburn. Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman.
But few current duos have proven as durable as Joe Wright, a brash purveyor of visual panache, and Keira Knightley, the stunner who ranks among Hollywood's most bankable female talents.
Opening Friday is their third and most daring collaboration, a sumptuously audacious adaptation of Anna Karenina that sets most of Tolstoy's chronicle of love and betrayal among Russia's 19th-century aristocracy inside a decaying theater. Considering that scenes include a heart-stopping horse race at full speed across a stage, it is little wonder that the adjective "bold" figures heavily in early reviews.
The British twosome — a self-proclaimed show-off who got his start at a puppet theater owned by his parents and a child performer who came of age as a soccer player in 2002's Bend It Like Beckham — for some reason gravitate toward literary-based period pieces. Not that Wright would describe them that way. "I like to think of them as being fantasies," he says. "I'm not interested in historical re-enactment. They allow us to dream and think in more expressive ways."
Wright declares his most frequent leading lady to be "my sister in celluloid," and the sibling-like connection that was forged in 2004 during the making of an emotionally unbound interpretation of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice appears to have inspired some of their best work.
"It feels like we've grown up together," says the filmmaker, 40, whose London home is just a few doors down from where 27-year-old Knightley resides. "We've seen each other through some good times and some bad times, and that's a lovely process. I like the idea of working with someone who has seen me at my weakest and also with success."
Not that they always agree. Both have been upfront about their heated debates. That includes much discussion over which role Knightley would take in their second effort, the 2007 World War II drama Atonement, which earned seven Oscar nominations, including best picture.
Wright's preference for glamorous Cecilia, whose posh mannerisms are in stark contrast to Knightley's girlish portrayal of free-spirited Elizabeth Bennet in Pride & Prejudice, won out and allowed the stylish actress to make a lasting impression in a showstopper of an emerald-green gown.
"He understands what I'm talking about," the actress says. "We do argue occasionally, and like siblings, you kind of know that you have to get over the argument because you're not going to stop being siblings. And so it's never the end of the world when you argue. There is a trust in the fact that underneath anything that is going on, you're still going to love each other."
She stands by her Mr. Wright even if her characters are sometimes subjected to abuse and worse. "We have worked three times, and he has killed me twice," she observes. "We've done three commercials, and he had me beaten up in one of them."
Adds Wright, "But you've made a lot of love, though."
She nods. "A lot of love."
But don't get Knightley started on the countless hours of rehearsal time she invested in learning Anna Karenina's intricate dance numbers, in which arms intertwine and flutter provocatively.
"Keira still hates me for that," says Wright with a wicked laugh.
"It was worth it," she concedes, "even though he cut another dance sequence that took ages."
Parallels in their private lives abound. Both have struggled with dyslexia. Both became involved in long-term relationships and subsequently broke up with cast members from Pride & Prejudice: Knightley with Rupert Friend (TV's Homeland) and Wright with Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher with Tom Cruise, out Dec. 21).
And they each have entered a settling-down phase. In 2010, Wright married Anoushka Shankar, a Grammy-nominated musician and daughter of celebrated sitarist and Beatles associate Ravi Shankar. Their son, Zubin, turns 2 in February. Knightley became engaged to her own musician, James Righton of the Klaxons, in May.
Their influence on each other even extends into their off-hours, such as in wardrobe choices. Today, they are a vision in black (her Celine shift) and blue (his natty dark denim suit).
"I'm wearing John Pearse," says Wright, dropping the name of the tailor who once co-owned the notorious '60s boutique Granny Takes a Trip. "Jacqueline Durran (the costumer for Pride & Prejudice and Atonement) made an exquisite denim dress for Keira and I was quite jealous of it. I felt I wanted a denim suit. I didn't think a dress would suit me."
Says Knightley, with a saucy smile, "Oh, I don't know ..."
They have come a long way since everyone from Austen cultists to Colin Firth fans (who consider the actor to be the definitive Mr. Darcy) questioned the wisdom of attempting to top the six-part 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice a decade later. Back then, Knightley was known for supporting roles in the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure and the ensemble comedy Love Actually.
However, Pride & Prejudice proved to be her entree into the big leagues after it earned her her first Oscar nomination. Wright's reward? A brand-new career path. His feature-directing debut allowed him to move on from the TV projects he had been doing in England to being sought after for theatrical movies.
No small feat, Wright notes. "My producer, Paul Webster, on Pride & Prejudice did keep saying to me, 'One in 10 first-time directors get to make another film.' "
Knightley laughs. "Nothing like working under pressure."
He glances fondly at her. "I think I owe my career to Keira, really."
Knightley gently scoffs: "Bull---- you do."
Tim Bevan, whose production company, Working Title, has produced all of Wright's vehicles with Knightley, thinks it is a match made in costume-drama heaven for both parties.
"Joe brings out the best in Keira," he says, while noting that the actress often gets bashed by hometown critics for being a little too one-note. "He can extract an emotional performance out of her that others are unable to do. He treats her with intellectual respect. Every actor has their tricks and looks, and he knocks that out of her. He insists on proper honesty on-set."
Meanwhile, Wright benefits from Knightley's charismatic wattage. "The reason I got him to see her on Pride is that I pointed out that she is a movie star, an English movie star," Bevan says. "What that does for him is to get these movies made."
While Wright likes to say that Knightley was the one who brought up the possibility of doing Anna Karenina together while making Atonement, she claims it wasn't so simple.
"We were having a discussion of great female characters," she says. "This was one. He remembers me reading it during Atonement. I thought I had read it earlier. But Anna Karenina was at the forefront of my mind. We also discussed Hedda Gablerand Antigone."
She says Wright called her two years later and asked, "Do you remember that talk? Do you fancy doing it?"
Both feel she is the perfect age now to pull off a role as mature as an aristocratic woman who tosses away her marriage and her standing in society after falling for a dashing philanderer.
"Keira was 18 when we made Pride, and when we made Atonement, she was 21," he says. "A lot has happened to her since, and that informs your understanding of the world, eventually. Keira is a proper grown-up now, and it really is a proper grown-up performance. She was incredibly powerful when she was 18 and 21, but it wasn't as focused or as direct. And that's changed. And I've changed, too."
Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and a tray is brought in stacked with plates of sushi and bowls of miso soup.
Continuing his thought about change, Wright jokes, "I now eat sushi."
Says Knightley, "You now get sushi brought to you."
Wright does want to clarify a wrong impression that arose during the film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. "Everyone keeps asking me, 'Is she your muse?' She is not my muse. My wife is my muse."
"That is a very good muse to have," Knightley concurs.
Still, he can't help but act somewhat peeved when the actress discusses an upcoming project, a reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise (including The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games) in which Chris Pine takes over the role of author Tom Clancy's CIA agent, previously played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck. Knightley is cast as Ryan's wife.
Wright can hardly wait to inquire, "Who is directing?"
"Kenneth Branagh," she answers, "who is also playing the baddie."
Wright, who next tackles a stage revival of Trelawny of the "Wells" at London's Donmar Warehouse, can't help but be amused by his own overreaction to the news. "I get a little bit jealous when I hear that. You are supposed to wait for me in a field of lavender."

The St. Louis Billikens (23-6, 11-4 A 10) finish up their A-10 regular season with game against the Duquesne Dukes (16-13, 7-8 A 10) on Saturday.
The St. Louis Billikens take on the Duquesne Dukes in the regular-season finale of A-10 conference play. St. Louis has played extremely well in the past few weeks, ripping off seven wins in their last eight games, while the Dukes have dropped three of their last four and fell to the BIllikens by a 27 point margin in the first matchup on Jan. 21.
In that first head-to-head win, Saint Louis got double-digit scoring from Dwayne Evans, Brian Conklin, Kwamain Mitchell, and Kyle Cassity, and used a 31-15 second half run to put the game away at home. On defense, they held the Dukes to just 30.9 percent shooting from the field and only Eric Evans reached double-digit scoring for Duquesne.
Here is a look at Saturday's matchup:
Game Time: 11:00 AM CT, Saturday, March 3, 2012

Looking for Star Trek Online friendly radio!?
Star Trek music, various music (50's-up), Simon and Schuster Star Trek Audio books, Sci-fi Audio Dramas, Star Trek news, Listener PvP, etc.
Station Owner: Kinneas (World's first Interviews w/STO Developers. Guinness Book of Records event co-starter: The Most Dressed Trekkers in One Location. The Hailing Frequency Podcast. Fleet Radio. Argus Array. ST:O-Zone. Subspace-Radio. STO-Radio. StarTrekradio. Trekradio.net.
Current DJ's: Kinneas, Huntress, ChrisX, DJ Doug, Woody Reloaded.
Currently recruiting DJ's (SAM/Shoutcast/Auto DJ systems, experience pref.)
Must of course, love Star Trek and preferably be an avid Star Trek Online and Star Trek news hound.
Contact me directly:
Kinneas@AOL.com
Skype: Kinneas01
-------
More info: About
"The Voice of Star Trek Online!"
"Broadcasting to the UFP and Beyond!"
Do those sound familiar? One is used by Subspace-radio.net and the other by Trekradio.net.
What do they have in common? I created the copy for both. As well as co-creating both of those stations.
I was also co-creator on: The Hailing Frequency Podcast, The Argus Array, STO-Zone Live, Subspace-radio.net, STO-Radio, StarTrekradio and Trekradio.net. Some may also remember me from my ST:Oned (Star Trek Online) cartoon series.
I tried over the years to help create the above stations and programs with the hopes that they would become actual business entities, attract artists, that they could provide some Creative Commons rights with regard to unique content and simple merchandising (tee-shirts etc) etc. It was impossible to do any of the above with the other co-creators. In the end I was never able to secure my own rights ( let alone those of the other creators). I have had to walk away (or get pushed out!) from all of the things I have helped create and allow those who came after to take control of those.
With no desire to go through the above again and with NO other partners or co-creators at this time, I have started Trekradio.com.
This is a very tough time as there are now quite a few stations out there and starting over is always no fun.
Please consider helping or tuning into Trekradio.com now and then!

Legal Statement

Dear listeners, Cryptic/PWE, Star Trek celebrities, Star Trek content creators and fellow Dj's.
I've noticed a lot of you have stopped listening in as frequently and many folks have become kind of phaser shy around me lately. Why?
It has come to my attention that the folks over at Trekradio.net have formed into an L.L.C. (A limited liability company, have begun trademark registration, sought council and want to send me a cease and desist letter.
Folks. Don't believe the hype and do not let this influence you to stop supporting Kinneas' Trekradio.com
Why?
When Trademark lawyers are brought into the picture, what will need to be determined is who has been operating in the field longer.
Kinneas, has been providing Star Trek podcasting and broadcasting for almost ten years now and was the first Star Trek Online broadcaster.
Through affiliations with folks like Zach Nicodemous and the Gaming Radio Network, Kinneas helped create Hailing Frequency, the world first podcast dedicated to Star Trek Gaming, Subspace-radio the first star Trek online radio station, STO-Radio, Star Trek Radio and Trek Radio.net itself.
Kinneas helped deliver the worlds very first interviews with Star Trek Online, Executive Producers and developers and with regards to Internet broadcasting, Kinneas was one of the first to start drawing in the Star Trek celebrity interviews.
Due to failed partnership agreements, multiple copyright infringements, and recently being forced out of Trekradio.net by secondary parties, Kinneas was given no choice but to sever association with all previous podcasts and Internet radio stations and and start all over with Kinneas' Trekradio.com.
Folks. Don't believe the fake legal hype. Don't be intimidated by the people now in control of Trekradio.net or any other station if you have wanted to leave and DJ for TR.COM or have your content broadcast..
If discovery is called for, it will be clear who has been operating in this field a very long time.
Thank you for your support all these years and thank you for continuing to support Kinneas' Trekradio.com

Very Dramatic... I was wondering why there were two trek radio stations.
Anyhow, I'd rather see a focused group effort. This would better utilize the fan base and keep us from jumping around stations. If we're not all in one place listening to one station, there won't be enough fans for any one station to actually make money. The talent is also spread too thin right now by having so many of these stations. This is exemplefied by the fact that every station is looking for DJ's. All adding another station does is further saturate the market.
To be honest, I kinda got a bad taste in my mouth about online radio after risa radio went down. I know you didnt claim a connection to them, so I'm not accusing you or anything.
They ran a contest for a trip to Vegas. To enter, you gave PayPal donations to the station. MANY people donated money to the station to enter the contest. Right before the winner was to be announced, the station stopped broadcasting and the URL began pointing to the Disney vacations site.
So the guy running that station skipped out on the project. He didn't award a winner or return the entry money. That's fraud..
With fraud like that going on, it's hard to get behind a new station that has been in so many failed partnerships. Further, I'm put off by the fact that people are calling each other out in public forums over their business disagreements. If there is going to be a legal battle, everyone involved is gonna be wishing they'd have kept their mouths shut when they actually get to litigation.
What we need is for all of you guys at all of your stations to get together and do the project right. Star Trek is about cooperation after all.

Grapevine mom leaves kids outside school in freezing weather
By BILL MILLER
wmiller@star-telegram.com
GRAPEVINE — Police are considering whether to pursue charges against a mother who left two children, ages 5 and 7, outside a closed Grapevine elementary school Thursday morning in freezing weather, a police spokesman said Friday.
It was 24 degrees with a wind chill in the single digits when a nurse on her way to her job at a nearby hospital spotted the children alone in the parking lot of Cannon Elementary School, 1300 W. College St.
The mother did not realize that Grapevine-Colleyville administrators had delayed the opening of school because of icy roads, said Lt. Todd Dearing, a police spokesman.
The nurse called 911 at 7:14 a.m., and officers went to get the children, Dearing said. Meanwhile, the mother heard on her car radio that the school was closed and returned to get her children, he said.
By the time she arrived, police were there, Dearing said.
“She made a mistake, she knows she made a mistake, and now we’re investigating to see if we’ll be filing criminal charges,” Dearing said.
The possible charge is abandoning or endangering a child, a state jail felony punishable by up to two years in jail and a $10,000 fine.
Child Protective Services was notified, Dearing said. CPS spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales said the children were not in the agency’s custody and thus she could not say whether CPS was involved.
This was an honest mistake, what is the phase that CPS uses to encourage people to adopt a child from foster care, “You don’t have to be perfect, to be a perfect parent.” “After all, kids don’t need perfection; they need you!”
This mom made a mistake and as soon as she realized it, she immediately turned around and went to get her children. They obviously were not outside that long before she did, since she was still in the car when she heard about the delay on the radio!!!!
Leave this mom alone and go focus on the Texas CPS workers who are failing to do their jobs. So many children have died in Texas after CPS involvement and now the police and CPS want to waste time investigating this mom.
What is amazing to me is that the police are even considering charges against this mom for her one mistake, yet absolutely no charges have been pressed against the Texas CPS workers who “Investigation shows family history of abuse missed in half of cases”
“Caseworkers for Texas Child Protective Services have regularly missed warning signs that Houston-area children were in danger, including failing to thoroughly investigate a family’s previous history of abuse or neglect, according to a report released on Monday.”
Why don’t you go press charges against these people instead, they are the ones who acutally deserve to be prosecuted!

Is the iPhone easily removable from the case when you need to use it?
- Asked by Michelle L

Best Answer
I didn't think it was that difficult to remove, but found myself just folding back the cover and talking with it still in the case. So far it has worn very well (used daily for a few months) except for the wristlet (handle) losing a rivet and couldn't fix. One thing I haven't seen noted is that you cannot take a photo while it is in the case. You have to remove it as the lens is covered while in the case. …More

McIvor, A.J. (1987) Manual work, technology, and industrial health, 1918-39. Medical History, 31 (2). pp. 160-189. ISSN 0025-7273
Workers' health in the inter-war years has been the subject ofrecent enquiry and was a topic that generated much contentious contemporary debate.' The focus of discussion has been the impact ofmass unemployment and consequent deprivation on standards of health, physique, and general well-being. The object here is to open up a further, so far very neglected dimension, by switching attention to the workplace, and investigating the theme of health at work in the 1920s and 1930s.2 The present generation has grown up with the knowledge that work, working conditions, and technology may seriously affect the mental and physical health and well-being of individual workers, and that health, fitness, and fatigue can considerably influence productivity levels and efflciency. Evidence of these correlations accumulated with the practical work of the Factory Inspectorate from the 1830s, the weight of experience of a relatively thin strand of welfarist, humanitarian employers (of the G. Cadbury and S. Rowntree genre), and the experimentation of "scientific management" theorizers, including the Americans, F. W. Taylor (time study) and F. and L. Gilbreth (motion study).

Sometimes we focus so much on locking all the other doors that we forget to lock the front door. Or, we think that nobody would ever be bold enough to break in through the front door, and having any lock on the door is therefore sufficient. But today's persistent threats hide behind the veil of anonymity, and are bold enough to try the front door. They may already be trying yours – will they be successful?
All it takes is one user with a weak password to allow an attacker access to your network.
Passwords are your first line of defense against unauthorized access to your organization. Knowledge of a user's password provides a direct entry point for an attacker to enter your organization, allowing them the opportunity to begin stealing secrets and perform reconnaissance on your internal network.
You may think your front door is locked. But the truth is, most corporate password policies encourage users to select weak, predictable passwords. Even if you lock out accounts after a certain number of invalid attempts, you are not protected against a persistent attacker who attempts to login to many accounts with only three or four top passwords.
Password audits enable you to validate the effectiveness of your password policies, and identify users who are selecting weak passwords. A comprehensive audit performed by SCG's highly skilled team of experts allows you to quantitatively measure the actual risk posed to your organization from ineffective policies and under-trained users.
."
- Per Thorsheim, CISA, CISM, CISSP-ISSAP. Organizer of the Passwords security conferences.
During an audit, SCG applies the same techniques utilized by actual attackers, refined with years of experience and real-world data. In order to simulate an attacker with months to work on your password databases, SCG operates several high-performance clusters that are capable of cracking passwords at a rate of nearly 400 billion guesses per second, and can simulate weeks of advanced, persistent attacks in a matter of hours. And unlike other password auditing services, we own and operate all of our own hardware – SCG does not use any "cloud" providers, so your data remains in our possession, under our control, and secured according to our own security policies.

Special Equipment:
2 knives of excellent quality, a set of good lockpicks
Appearance:
She is of medium height, and has thick, wavy black hair. She has been called pretty in the past, although not by many. Her face is marred by a permanent cynical expression and a scar running from her left temple to her jawline, which she refuses to discuss.
Background:
Gypsy (not her real name) is the youngest daughter of a minor lord. Her parents were petty, greedy people, far too concerned with social position. All but one of her siblings, the second-to-youngest sister, were exactly the same as her parents. They were constantly in competiton with each other, often to the point of violence. Her brothers fought with one another about who would inherit what. The sisters (all except the youngest two) were continually fighting about who would get to marry who. Gypsy was the strange one. She refused to dress as her mother thought she should, she would help the servants with the domestic chores (gasp!), and she was in general “a disgrace to her family name.” Gypsy’s father saw his children merely as tools to improve his own position. He made political marriages for his children; in all but two cases they never even knew they were going to get married until about a week before. Gypsy, who was utterly sick of it all, talked her youngest sister into running away with the man she loved, a soldier whom their parents considered way beneath her. Her father was furious. Her mother wasn’t angry, she actually approved; she thought Gypsy had merely been getting rid of a rival (the second-to youngest sister was the prettiest). When her father calmed down, he told Gypsy that she would have to marry the man he had chosen for her sister (a lord that Gypsy absolutely detested.) She refused. Her father, who could never be called a kind man, flew into a violent rage, which left a permanent scar on Gypsy’s face. Gypsy walked out, and has never set foot in her parents’ house since. She went to the city of _________, changed her name, and has actually been quite happy. She’s a jack-of-all-trades; she’s worked in a tavern, as a messenger, on ships (passenger, cargo, merchant, and pirate), as a con-artist, as a thief, and even did a stint in a circus. She doesn’t stay put for very long (hence the name she chose), either because of wanderlust or outstanding warrants.
Roleplaying Notes:
Due to various circumstances, Gypsy’s become quite good at knife fighting; there are few who can beat her, and she will fight dirty if her opponent does. Her childhood has left her quite cynical, and she can be quite hard to get along with. She especially views the nobility with disgust and suspicion. She doesn’t handle compliments well, as in her family they were merely opening gambits to get at something else, and she distrusts them all on general principles now.
Hooks:
Perhaps she steals something of value from the PCs, or cons them in some way; her background is irrelevant here (for now).
Maybe they’ve run into members of her family before, and when they meet her, they notice the family resemblance.
Some idiot could have discovered parts of her past, and has kidnapped her for ransom; if someone’s hired the PCs, it will be a friend or her youngest sister, as her father doesn’t acknowledge Gypsy’s existance. And quite likely, the PCs may have to save the kidnappers; Gypsy can get quite violent.
The youngest sister could hire the PCs to track Gypsy down and bring her “home.”
The father could actually feel bad about what he did, and want to make amends, and hire the PCs to find Gypsy. Not only do they have to figure out who she is, they have to find her, AND convince her they’re on the level.
The lord might die, and for some reason (probably because his other children have all killed each other) he’s named Gypsy in his will, and the PCs get the fun of letting her know this. Once they actually find her, they have to make her believe them, and get her to claim her inheritance, which she’s not at all interested in.
Gypsy could come to the PCs, because something’s happened to her youngest sister, who is the only member of her family that Gypsy would actually do something for. If her sister is in danger, then Gypsy will probaby insist on joining the PCs. This would not be a bad thing.
Gypsy’s father was murdered. Someone wants Gypsy found because either she’s a suspect, he wants protect her from the killer, or he is the killer and plans to murder all of the lord’s children. Or all three.

I think this character could really get interesting if you expanded on her life after leaving home. Instead you just list thing, pirate, tavern servant, circus performer. It was that period, and how she viewed her family through the lense of those experinces, that should really define her at the point in her life when you would have her introduced to the PCs.
Some questions are
The forces that drove her away are clear, but did she ever find what she was looking for?
I take it she find did not find sincerity in the commoners world, and that is why she remains so cynical.
Though what did that do to her moral code and sense of the world. She hated the rich but did she have belief that people could be better or that some people were better? What does she think now and how will that effect her decision making process?
I am not sure what lines she is unwilling to cross though, and those are the big questions for any character.
Is she happy away from her family?
Is she still principled?
Does she believe in romantic love?
Does she have political views? (i.e. An idea for how things should be)
Does she have lusts or desires like a normal person or is she some consumed by anger and distrust that she cant express them?
If she has no political views, why give her this noble backstory unless you wanted to use it to critique the exsisting political structure? Is it because money really does make the RPG world go round and to be interesting she has to be tied to it?
Would she be less interesting if she was a low born woman who didnt want to marry or live with her abusive family?
Does she really believe she will die as a tavern wench or sailor or does she still somewhere in her mind believe that she will one day return to her old life, but in different and more powerful position?
What does she enjoy?
This character is so shallow it is almost offensive. If the piece had taken a different tone, or she had been seen through eyes of some observer that wouldn't have had a reason to have this limited knowledge of her, then perhaps we would have reason to expect the gaps. She is little more than a neo-sterotype.
All that being said maybe a cliche neo-sterotype is exactly what one may want in his or her game. I don't want to bring you score down or upset the balance of things by voting low on old post which you have a high score for. So I will give you a 4.5 so I don't bring your score down.

Michelle Obama wore a custom Thom Browne ensemble for Inauguration Day on Jan. 21, 2013. Browne received the Hewitt-Cooper National Design Award for Fashion in 2012 and attended a White House luncheon hosted by the First Lady for the occasion in July.
Michelle Obama kicked off a day of Inauguration activities this morning in an ensemble reminiscent of the outfit she wore for her husband’s swearing-in nearly four years ago: a dress that hit just below the knee with a matching coat and pumps.
This time, the First Lady chose a navy outfit designed by Thom Browne, an American menswear designer recently honored with the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award for fashion. Michelle Obama hosted a White House luncheon in July to toast Browne and the other winners. She also wore a lace design of his to the third and final presidential debate between her husband and Republican candidate Mitt Romney last October.
(MORE: See Michelle Obama’s Inauguration Day 2009 Outfit)
The blue coat’s pattern was inspired by a men’s silk tie, according to the AP, and was custom made for Obama. She accessorized the outfit with J. Crew pumps—which she also wore for Inauguration Day in 2009—and a necklace designed by Cathy Waterman. Obama also wore a navy number to her husband’s private swearing-in on Sunday. That dress was made by Reed Krakoff, the fashion designer behind the controversial $990 bird shirt that Ann Romney wore for a CBS This Morning appearance during the campaign.
The First Lady’s inaugural outfit wasn’t the only familiar ensemble of the morning: first daughters Malia and Sasha Obama wore jewel-tone colored coats similar to the Crew Cut ensembles they chose in 2009. Malia opted for a violet coat from J. Crew, while younger sister Sasha wore a periwinkle Kate Spade number.

Over the last couple of weeks, the Christmas window displays have been unveiled for what is undoubtedly my favourite thing about the commercial side of this season. I think Liberty and Fortnum & Mason have the best windows this year, although the Selfridges white themed ones are pretty spectacular, too. Here’s a sneak peak of Liberty’s ‘Twelve Days of Christmas’ themed windows:
It must be so much fun to be a window dresser, or to be part of the (as Liberty call it) Visual Merchandising Team. Fortnum & Mason’s ‘Showtime‘ theme is satisfyingly glitzy and extravagant, just the thing to lift every Christmas shopper’s spirits:
These windows are a work of art in themselves. I’m not ashamed to say I’ll be doing plenty of window shopping over the next month.

Making a holiday wreath has become my own personal tradition (does two years in a row count as a tradition?). Wreaths are about as complicated as I like to get with my DIY, but this wreath was definitely worth it. The example:
And here’s mine:
I did a few things differently. I used a hardback instead of a paperback which gives it more of a sculptural quality due to the heavier paper. I also added a little bit of gold glitter to the antiquing process because glitter makes everything better.
However, anyone who attempts this project be warned: use a book that’s 200 pages or more! She mentions that you’ll need a long(ish) book in the instructions, but I foolishly did not read that part and ended up substituting pages from a paperback (which are much lighter) in order to finish the center. Oh well! Perfection be damned, I think it turned out well. If you’re looking for something a little bit easier or you have a fear of hot glue, I’d definitely take a swing at the paper leaf wreath I made last year. Here’s the example:
And here’s mine:
Here’s a few more I’m thinking about attempting next year.

- Are you a retired athlete…or considering retiring?
- Do you want to get the same rewards you got from sport and more?
Learn how to apply your Champion Mind to succeed beyond sport
It’s not easy for professional athletes that are retiring from their sport to leave a successful sporting career behind and move on to a new life. It can create confusion, a lack of direction, and a lack of purpose.
If you are going through this, you are not alone.
Statistics show that the majority of athletes (up to 80%) suffer some form of post-sporting blues and even depression. And the problem is, most athletes suffer in silence, thinking they should be able to cope, they are better than this. This approach tends to prolong and intensify the inner pain and conflict.
Even highly successful athletes can struggle in the transition. No matter whether you achieved all your sporting goals or not, you may struggle.
Common Questions that arise are:
……..”Who am I now?” .
…….”What do I do now?”
After having a career that brought so much reward the retired athlete can feel a loss of identity and may now feel unfulfilled—emotionally, and often financially.
What now?
As athletes, you do know how to set and achieve goals, you do know how to focus and you do know how to perform. What if you could apply these same resources to a new career? What if you lived your life with the same drive and passion you did as an athlete?
Success beyond Sport offers a solution for effective athlete transition.
In Success beyond Sport, 2000 Olympian, Annette Lynch (formerly Huygens-Tholen) shares how she overcame the struggles of transition and how 8 Winning Steps can help you succeed in a new role.
Successful transition is more than choosing a new career and Success beyond Sport will help you transition successfully. Whether you chose to retire or the decision was forced upon you due to age, injury, or performance, the lessons in this book will teach and inspire you to new successes.
GO FOR GOLD IN THE GAME OF LIFE
The methods and exercises described in the book are the same exercises Annette uses with her clients. The thing they have in common is a desire to move forward, to change direction, GET RESULTS and create a successful life.
If you want to make changes because you are not happy with your current results, if “fine” is not good enough, or you want to continue to grow, then “Success beyond Sport” can help you with that. Why settle for less, when you can be as great as you want to be.
The 8 Winning Points and Success Training exercises can be done by anybody.
Success beyond Sport will help you to:
- Overcome the loss and confusion of life after sport
- Motivate you to strive for and achieve new successes
- Expand your identity – you are so much more than just a sportsperson
- Build a supportive network and team
- Regain the feeling of significance
- Get direction and purpose
- Overcome low self-esteem……..and more.

I was pretty ecstatic to be chosen by Old Navy and CrowdTap to be part of the Old Navy Style Council Summer Style is short and sweet promotion where I was able to visit Old Navy and get a free pair of shorts. I have never been a big fan or shorts shopping, regardless of what size I have been. Old Navy offered a nice variety of styles, sizes and patterns to choose from! I grabbed my armful of different styles and headed for the dressing room!
I loved the cute tie belt on these shorts, but they were a tad short for my taste!
These shorts were super short and comfy but I wasn't quite feeling the print. Looking back at the pics
was more my speed :)
These were easily my absolute favorite. The fit was comfortable, with out being too baggy
or too tight. And the colors were so much fun! Perfection, in the form of shorts!
Comfy and cute without being clingy. The perfect summer outfit!
I was pretty happy we both have super white legs :)
And her super cute son Michael Goofing off!
I was very pleased with the selection the was offered at the store near me! I was hoping to try on some of the bermudas, which there weren't too many off, but that helped get me out of my long shorts funk. The sizes were good as well. I picked the same size of all the shorts that I tried on and they all fit well. It was nice not to have to run back and forth picking up other sizes to try.
Want to learn how to be a crowdtapper and have the chance for excellent opps like this? Check out this link and sign up! They offer some awesome rewards. I am very proud to be a Crowdtapper!
* I was given 2 coupons to get free shorts from Old Navy. However all opinions expressed in this post are my own, honest opinions. I was not given any additional compensation for my opinions.
Great post! I love those shorts you picked out, super cute! I need to get over to Old navy to get some shorts for this summer, I think you have inspired me :)

“going Bulworth”
(via nedhepburn)
DO IT.
DO IT.
DO IT.
(via apoplecticskeptic)
Hmm, using Warren Beatty movies from the 90’s as inspiration seems like a bit of a shaky premise to me. Never mind that Bulworth was having an affair, right? Yeesh, doesn’t exactly conjure up images of Roosevelt’s fireside chats, but maybe if he just starts lighting up in public & makes a rap video, this whole “going Bulworth” strategy will have some legs. Then again, IT WAS A BEATTY MOVIE FROM THE 90’s!!! (via winstonwolfe)
I can only imagine what Obama’s REALLY thinking…
(via winstonwolfe)
I’ve only seen the trailer but judging by that, the history that I already know and the movie poster, this is probably the most Anarcho-Capitalistic space documentary of all time.
say what you want about anarchists at least we don’t make bad rap songs
That depends what counts as “Anarchist” and what counts as a “bad rap song”, though
That awkward moment when a mutualist acknowledges that value is subjective…
Boom.
Minimum Wage Business Realities
Why do some employers favor a raise in the minimum wage? Profit per employee plays a major role.
See Also
Costco is doing what Amazon just did, trying to play an ignorant public to help make the market more hostile for their own competitors.
Costco would love for the minimum wage to go up to a point that’s higher than the average starting pay of their competitors but below the starting pay at Costco. It has zero impact on Costco’s business model but will severely hurt the bottom line of others, like Walmart or Target.
Costco plays this off as if they are trying to help the people, in reality, they are aiming to hurt or even shutdown their competition, and they want to do this not through better business models but through legislation that comes from misguided economical theory based solely on emotions.
Amazon did the same thing when it lobbied for an internet sales tax. Many people thought that, “Oh, it must be a legitimate tax if the biggest online retailer is lobbying for it!”. What these people didn’t realize is that Amazon is building local warehouses and would now have to pay local and state sales tax and they wanted the government to levy an Internet Sales Tax so that they could ensure that their competition, who don’t have local warehouses, would have to pay taxes just like Amazon.
No one is better at playing politics than the CEOs of giant corporations. Always remember that and take what they say with a cargo container of salt.

The latest exhibition at the Montréal Musée des Beaux-Arts is not only about the masculine pursuit of power and immortal legacy, but also about the way in which we construct meaning about this world and the afterlife. About our struggle against time and memory, and about the types of narratives we construct out of our lives for the future generations to uncover.
The First Emperor of China of the Qin dynasty (221-206 BC) dreamed of a dynasty lasting 10,000 generations. In 246 BC, Ying Zheng, then only thirteen years old, acceded to the throne of the state of Qin. After having conquered the last independent state and put an end to 500 years of war and intergovernmental strife, Ying Zheng became king of the whole of China in 221 BC. Within 4 years of his death, rebellions destroyed the dynasty, burned his capital, looted his tomb, and were followed by civil war. Dreaming of an army to protect him through his afterlife, the First Emperor had a larger-than-life-size terracotta army built, which has survived the Emperor by thousands of years.
The Emperor’s terracotta army consists of 8000 soldier figures (excavated between 1977-99 in Lintong, Shaanxi Province), thousands stone-plaqued suits of armour and helmets (excavated in 1998), 8 musician figures, a water garden (excavated in 2001-03), as well as animal and bird figures.
The army faces eastward, possibly because the First Emperor anticipated revenge attacks from the deceased rulers of the states he had conquered in the east and southeast of Qin. But nobody really knows why. He not only built an army that was to protect him in his afterlife, he build a three-dimensional narrative of what he believed his after life to be.
Over the years, the site has expanded, and new soldiers have been dug out of the thick layer of loess. A first campaign, from 1978 to 1984, unveiled 1087 terracotta figures. A second in 1985 lasted only a year, and in June 2009, a five‐year campaign for pit number one was authorized. So far, approximately two thousand soldiers have been reclaimed, while another six thousand still lie dormant. Almost six hundred archaeologists of the largest in‐situ museum in China are hard at work unearthing, cleaning, recomposing and preserving these marvellous witnesses to Qin Shihuangdi’s grandeur and megalomania.
All warriors originally carried real weapons, bronze spears and swords, and although ten thousand have been found, this represents a fraction of the original number. Most were looted soon after the demise of Qin by the Han rebels, who set fire to the pits in 206 BC.
One of the exhibition rooms features a projection of several scenes from the film Hero (2002). Set in ancient China, before the reign of the First Emperor, the film tells the story of warring factions throughout the Six Kingdoms, who plot to assassinate the most powerful ruler, Qin. When a minor official defeats Qin’s three principal enemies, he is summoned to the palace to tell Qin the story of his surprising victory.
In one scene, thousands of arrows are shot at one warrior across the palace court yard; most arrows hit the wall, only one spot remains uncovered by the arrows – where the warrior stood (warrior as the ultimate shield). This imagery is recreated in the exhibition design in the arrow room.
The exhibition can be seen at the Montréal Musée des Beaux-Arts from February 11 to June 26, 2011.

Repost of Petrie post with correction on quote. It's Petrie talking, not Cousins
With DeMarcus Cousins suspended indefinitely for unprofessional behavior and conduct detrimental to the team, there has already been speculation about whether the Kings should trade the talented but problematic third-year center. Kings basketball president Geoff Petrie said the Kings still plan to work with Cousins, not deal him. . The latest incident happened Friday night when he exchanged words with coach Keith Smart and his response to Smart became so personal of an attack that Smart left him in the locker room at halftime

It is backed by an extensive reference database embedded in an effective analysis and report generation tool.
SUMI is recommended to any organisation which wishes to measure the perceived quality of use of software, either as a developer, a consumer of software, or as a purchaser/consultant. SUMI is increasingly being used to set quality of use requirements by software procurers.
SUMI also assists the manager in identifying the most appropriate software for their organisation. It has been well documented that if staff have quality tools to work with, this contributes to overall efficiency of staff and the quality of their work output.
Our customers have used SUMI effectively to:
SUMI has been used specifically within development environments to:
SUMI is the de facto industry standard questionnaire for analysing users' responses to desktop software or software applications provided through the internet.
SUMI is the only commercially available questionnaire for the assessment of the usability of software which has been developed, validated, and standardised on an international basis.
There is a large range of languages in which SUMI is available. Each language version is carefully translated and validated by native speakers of the language.
SUMI ennables measurement of some of the user-orientated requirements expressed in the European Directive on Minimum Health and Safety Requirements for Work with Display Screen Equipment (90/270/EEC).
SUMI is mentioned in the ISO 9241 standard as a recognised method of testing user satisfaction.
We now have a variety of methods in which we deliver the SUMI service.
This is a service housed at University College Cork, the url of which is sumi.ucc.ie/en/ (for the English language version - other language versions are coming onstream with demand.) You can see the questionnaire on this link but you'll need a password to be able to send data (you may use '999' as a throw-away password but leave your name in one of the comments fields at the bottom.)
This service provides a detailed report giving the SUMI output including content analysis of some additional questions.
As above, this service is housed at University College Cork, the url of which is sumi.ucc.ie/en/ (for the English language version - other language versions are coming onstream with demand.) You can see this questionnaire on this link but you'll need a password to be able to send data (you may use '999' as a throw-away password but leave your name in one of the comments fields at the bottom.)
This service provides a CSV file of the scored data and the additional questions, and an Item Analysis but little else. It is intended for studies of between 12 to 100 users and clients who prefer to do their own analyses.
This service is primarily intended for labs who want to do a quick in-house test or clients who cannot access the UCC site. You will get a questionnaire in pdf form and a licence for the period of your data collection. You make as many copies of the questionnaire as you need. When you have gathered your data, you send a file of data to HFRG using a standard format. HFRG will then produce a standard SUMI output and send it back to you by e-mail.
Dates for submitting and sending data back must be agreed upon beforehand. The usual turn-around time can be very short (half a working day) if you have arranged this with HFRG.
If you are a student and want to apply for a free use of SUMI please see the academic licence page.
For a large scale survey, or a survey with additional questions, you will have to contact Dr Jurek Kirakowski at jzk@ucc.ie to discuss your survey and get a quotation for the cost of it.
SUMISCO is based on profiles of about two thousand responses to commercially available software. It will tell you how your product compares to this standardisation base: whether you are about average for the market, below, or above. Because of the background statistics in our database, you can find out very precisely how you compare to the market.
SUMI consists of 50 statements to which the user has to reply that they either Agree, Don't Know, or Disagree.
Here are some example statements:
Item No. Item Wording 1. This software responds too slowly to inputs. 3. The instructions and prompts are helpful. 13. The way that system information is presented is clear and understandable. 22. I would not like to use this software every day.You may also take a look at a sample questionnaire (UK wording) in pdf format,
It takes a user about 3 minutes to fill out the questionnaire, perhaps a few minutes longer on the internet version.
One way of administering it is on paper: print out the SUMI form and get your user to make marks on the page. It takes an analyst about one minute to type each user's responses into a file for scoring by SUMISCO or to send to HFRG for scoring.
On the other hand you may decide to go for the internet, online option.
You can also do a hybrid: concoct your own HTML pages to be served on your intranet and either send the results to HFRG for analysis.
Online SUMI might require sample sizes with a minimum of about 20 unless your respondents are well selected.
However, we know that paper SUMI will give you reliable results with as few as 12 users. This is because you are able to control the quality of your user sample directly when administering SUMI on paper.
You can use fewer users if you wish, but beware that your results may not be as representative of the true user population. In fact, SUMI has yielded useful information with user sample sizes of four or five.
However, this question is always like 'how long is a piece of string.' You should try to get as many users as you can within your timeframe.
It all depends on the kind of service you want. See the Pricing and Ordering Information page.
We don't do educational discounts on SUMI.
However, if you are a student pursuing a full-time course of study and wish to use SUMI for your project or term assessment, eMail Dr Jurek Kirakowski and discuss the use you would like to make of SUMI. This year's students are, after all, next year's professionals...
Because of some bad experiences with students from a University which shall not be named, for a student licence we will need information from the permanent staff member supervising the project involving SUMI. Please see the academic licence page.

"The Life And Times Of Prophecy"
Lindsay Lohan swung through to Domingo Zapata’s Oscar Art Show to Celebrate her recent positive progress report with the Courts and Judge Stephanie Sautner on Wednesday. And as we all know, she’s definitely following through on her Community Servicing.
The event was held at Mr. C’s Hotel in Beverly Hills, and brought out folks like Stephen Dorff, Jason Segel, Mischa Barton, Jaimie Hilfiger, Tara Reid and Taylor Armstrong. It was also a Mother-Daughter night, where the mothers showed off their works of art, considering Lindsay brought her mama Dina, and Mischa brought her mother Nuala. Beautiful works of Art indeed.
But Lindsay definitely had a reason to go out tonight. Let’s just all give her a pat on the back and say she maybe deserves an outing or two.

Will Supernatural Demons Run Round the “Uncanny Valley”?August 19th, 2008 by jonathan | Filed under Special Effects.
Supernatural has done an amazing job at special effects that don’t tread into the cheesy. Recently, series creator Eric Kripke stated that they learned their lesson in Wendigo. Anyone who’s seen The Six Million Dollar Man [in 2008, that's Bill Gate's lunch money] fight Bigfoot, or had to sit through a Power Rangers battle against a big rubber villain, knows that good special effects are no easy feat.
Even more challenging is the animation of realistic human faces. It’s a cliché in the CGI world that the more realistic human animation becomes, the less convincing it becomes. Supernatural, whose real charm is its human story uses makeup, and the largely unseen to do its evil bidding. Buffy and Angel of the also-very-human Whedonverse, relied heavily on a crack staff of makeup artists, as well. What if, though, they could create a world of evil, humanoid beasties that pushed the edge but didn’t cost an arm and a leg? What if a human actor could work the magic in front of a video camera, with no sensors pasted on the face, and have the computer generate a realistic demon, bigfoot, or wendigo?
Image-Metrics seems to have an answer to that question. It may be some time before the really good stuff becomes available –2020?- but its use in television and film, and, even more, in video games, could make for some incredible results!
Check out this demo of “Emily”. At the end, you’ll see the real actress, but the rest is all computer generated.
Impressive, eh?
Would this be useful technology for shows like Supernatural? Leave your comments, and let’s hear what you think!

Pretty cool.
I think SPN did a great job w/ Wendigo, though. Perhaps BECAUSE they used a real man for the part. It didn’t look “forced” the way so many computer animated horror-villains look anymore.

-Back When I Used To Think Pink Was Light Skinned.
Pink
my song
Love P!nk back then and still love her now.
Don’t you wish you could turn the hands of time Don’t you wish you still were mine Don’t you wish I’d take you back...
There you Go
The moment LA Reid knew she was from Philadelphia there was a light bulb above his head and dollar signs in his eyes.
This version of P!nk is just as fake and manufactured as any teen pop starlet you can think of. (Britney, Miley,...
“Sometimes it be’s like that” is one of my most commonly used phrases.
i really did think Pink was black when I was younger or at least partially but she slowly rewhite-ified over the years.

Is there a method or a tool that can detect if someone has separated my hard disk from my computer, copied data from it, and returned it back?
I want to be sure that no one has done this without my knowledge, but I'm not sure how to this.
Deep freeze
The use of deep freeze is irrelevant in this situation.
If they are semi competent, they will use a read only interface.
The last access timestamp will only be changed if they are using a read and write interface. Turning off the write interface is trivial. This is what forensics does. They never put an original drive in a read/write interface. Always in a read only. Then they make a working copy. All without altering a single bit on the original drive.
Your best bet is using a disk encryption like Bitlocker or TrueCrypt.
edit:
thanks alot, but could you clarify more what you mean by read and write interface please??
thanks alot, but could you clarify more what you mean by read and write interface please??
Devices like these . . .
They physically block write access to a drive. Often used in forensics/HD recovery for legal and practical reason, like the Amanda Knox case.
dd if=/dev/sdx of=out.img
Everyone seems to be going for full disc encryption, which certainly has its merits for securing your data but doesn't address the question of telling if someone's been in your machine and monkeying with your hard drive.
For that simple task, find a pack of the irritatingly sticky plain labels which, once stuck, tear instead of coming off cleanly, sign your name on it and stick it over one of the screws holding your hdd in place (don't forget to clean the dust off first for a good bond). Not quite on the same scale as the manufacturers tamper evident seals but should prove sufficient to prevent anyone removing the hard drive without your knowledge. This means they either have to break the label which alerts you to the fact, or pull the wires out of the hard drive then mount it on a laptop, forcing them to to spend more time with your case open looking very suspicious!
Also its worth checking the back of your pc for a padlock attachment point, simple, fairly secure and effective.
Neither makes it impossible to get at your data but both add a significant level of inconvenience and force the attacker to either act overtly (ripping labels and bolt cutters to the padlock) or spend a lot more time monkeying with your pc and at risk of detection.
To discover tampering at a physical level, you could use something like Torque Seal on your drive's mounting hardware or the data cable connection. It is a lacquer that dries brittle so any tampering will crack and break the glob you installed on the hardware. It's used to make sure things like nuts and bolts on helicopters haven't moved and are still torqued to spec.
S.M.A.R.T. attributes may help in determining if the disk has been tampered with between two intervals. These attributes, on Linux, can be queried with "smartctl -a /dev/sda".
The simplest attribute for that is probably Power_Cycle_Count. When you power up the computer, this will be one more than the value when it was last shut down. So, by remembering this value before you shut down, and checking it when you power up next time, you can determine if the disk has been powered up in between.
Just a thought..maybe S.M.A.R.T.(if available) contains some information that can be used.
Unless you can remember exactly how things were placed within your computer prior to the suspected intrusion (a photographic memory, or a photograph, are two such tools that immediately come to mind), it will be very difficult to know if your hard drive was removed from your computer.
Note: Chassis intrusion features can usually be circumvented, so this may not be the most reliable method either although it can be helpful.
Chances are that an intruder who knows how to do this may also be smart enough not to modify your disk in any way, and either just copy only the files they want/need, or copy the disk in its entirety so they can "snoop around" at their leisure at some later time.
The bottom line is that if you're truly concerned about someone accessing your hard drive, you have to be preventive. If physically removing your computer away from the danger is not a viable option, then encryption works very well; this is my favourite disk encryption tool:
TrueCrypt (free and open source)
What I particularly like about this tool is that there's no built-in backdoor, so even a court order won't get it decrypted if you've taken the right steps to protect the encryption key.
How this tool is relevant to your situation:
If your hard drive is encrypted, and the intruder removes it from your computer for the purpose of accessing your data, they will only find encrypted data (and, initially, the Operating System will most likely detect it as an "uninitialized disk") that simply looks like random information to just about everyone.
The two ways the intruder may gain access to your data is:
A "lucky guess" at your password (so pick a good one that's difficult to guess, even with a brute force attacking tool) or key (highly unlikely, although not completely impossible)
You provided a copy of your password or key to the intruder (intentionally or unintentionally)
With your average home computer (no special physical security), when the machine is shutdown, there is no trace left of activities done with the hardware.
If the disk is removed and mounted read-only, it would be very difficult to identify this was done using any software.
The only thing that comes to mind is, if the disk was writeable during such an activity, and the host OS ended up updating timestamps on the disk (files, directories) you might be able to detect that the disk was physically accessed outside your system.
This comes with various other caveats like, the other system also had its time set correctly (a reasonable expectation if the user did not think of a read-only mount) and you know the time-window when your system was expected to be powered-down (hence, access times in that window are suspect).
For such data to be usable, you must mount the disk without write access while your 'forensics' is not done. You might then be able to read the access times of individual files and directories to identify what was looked at (read or copied out).
Now, if this is for a future possibility of data-theft, it would be tons easier to plan ahead -- just encrypt all your critical data.
I'm pessimistic about prevention from reading the drive, and telling, if somebody did, so I would advice to use encryption too. You still don't know whether somebody did copy the encrypted data, but if he did, it is hard to break (hope so).
Now is the attacker clever, informed, does he have time, equipment and money? A simple trick, which will not work, if the bad guy is reading here, would be to stick a hair, which is hard to see, and easy to break, to your drive and the chassis, best: across the data cable.
Now if somebody removes the drive, he will break the hair without mentioning it. Except he read this advice, and acts very carefully.
If he is very well equiped, but you are too, you can take a hair which you perform a DNA-test on. You don't say whoms hair it is. The intruder might replace the hair with a random one, but can't replace it with a hair of the right DNA. But maybe he knows how to glue a broken hair together? Or he knows how to dissolve the glue? :)
Many new computers allow password-protecting the hard drive itself. It would be a BIOS setting. The protection is enforced through the drive's electronics, so access would be denied on another machine.
Keep in mind that encryption, though a good idea if you need to do it, also would prevent you from being able to recover from many computer problems. And if the hard drive started to fail, you could never recover your files from an encrypted disk. So make sure that you have good backups. And a disk image of an encrypted disk is still encrypted and can be restored to a new drive if necessary.
Windows built-in EFS (Encrypting File System) can be used for individual files and folders. And the free Windows BitLocker encryption tool can encrypt a whole drive.
Are we not we simply skirting the real issue here?
Like a new born child, we should NEVER leave our PC alone in an open accessible area! Where is your notebook now? Security starts with us and not after the fact.
Personal data comes with a degree of paranoia. If you leave it on your system then you are afraid that it may be stolen. If your data is that critical, then, as soon as you create/acquire it, remove it to a secure storage device, aka an encrypted SD flash device. This device can then be with you at all times.
Current computer technology will not detect the tampering of the data on a physical storage device. It is this lack of security that permits PC technicians like my self to salvage user data in the event of virus/malware damage. When in the future storage devices are embedded with a running security program, then the device itself will know when it has been tampered with.
Simply take responsibly for your data! If you permit someone access, then you cannot complain if it is exploited!
As a direct answer to the posted question; as of today, NO, it is not possible to determine if someone has removed and simply copied your files.
Thank you all for listening.

This topic explains how to use the API Management page in the Video Cloud Studio to view and copy your Media API tokens.
When you use the Video Cloud Media API, your method calls require a token. Tokens are issued to accounts by Video Cloud and give you access to your account using the API. You append your token to the call as a URL parameter,
token=<tokenString>, where
tokenString is your URL-encoded token.
Note: Media API tokens generally end with one or more dots (.). Be sure to include the dots when you use the API tokens—it's easy to lose them when you cut and paste.
If you're not already familiar with API tokens, read Getting Started with the Media API. The Media API is not available to Video Cloud Express Plan I or II publishers; read tokens for the Media API are available to Video Cloud Express Plan III publishers, and the full Media API is available to Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise publishers.
In this topic, you will learn about:
There are several types of tokens:
A read token and a read token with URL access were automatically generated for you when your account was created. The Video Cloud Studio displays your account's tokens (see Managing your tokens). Video Cloud Pro or Enterprise publishers can also create their own tokens.
Note that if your account was created before the Brightcove 3.3.2 release (August 27, 2009), tokens were not automatically created with your account. If you are a Video Cloud Pro or Enterprise publisher, you can create your own tokens, as described in the section in this topic, Creating a token. For other circumstances, contact Brightcove customer support.
You can manage the Media API tokens for your account on the Account Settings: API Management page in the Video Cloud Studio. To get to this page:
You can:
Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise publishers can have up to 6 Read tokens and up to 3 Write tokens and can use the Video Cloud Studio API Management page to create new tokens. Video Cloud Express Plan III publishers can have 2 Read tokens and can delete an existing Read token and create a new one.
To create a new token for your account:
If you require additional tokens, contact Brightcove customer support.

TurboSquid
posted this on May 25, 2011 08:41
TurboSquid has partnered with amanaimages, Japan’s leading seller of stock photography. The partnership opens up the opportunity for members of the SquidGuild Network to distribute their 3D models to the rich but largely untapped market in Asia.
Japan has the world's 3rd largest GDP and a huge amount of 3D production, however sales to Japanese customers account for a tiny percentage of the revenue that TurboSquid receives. This is largely due to the language and cultural differences when operating in the Japanese market. Japanese customers, like American customers and those of other cultures, prefer to buy from a website in their own language, with customer support in their language, localized payment methods and the billing cycles that they are accustomed to. In no other country are the differences so strong and the opportunity so large as in Japan.
For those reasons, TurboSquid partnered with a Japanese company that will sell our artists' products to this largely untapped market. Our partner has taken all the descriptions and thumbnails for all priced 3D models and textures by SquidGuild artists and has translated them into their own Japanese website. They will provide a large sales force and a full support team to handle all sales. We've worked with them over the last few months to setup this distribution process and integration into our sales and royalty payments process.
Royalty rates for TurboSquid and artists will be slightly lower (see below) , but artists are given the ability to opt-out of selling on the amanaimages site if they do not wish to be a part of the program.
We created this partnership because TurboSquid believes new Japanese customers will begin purchasing stock 3D models and textures. To participate, you must be in the SquidGuild and keep the opt-in set to on. In case you would not like to participate for any reason, we've made opting out as simple as possible.
You will be able to identify amanaimages sales from the monthly sales detail report. From here amana will be identified in the source column. Please note that the price will also reflect the payment difference from the amanaimages sale.
If you wish to opt out and no longer sell your content on amanaimages, you simply need to go to your dashboard and click on Edit SquidGuild Network Settings. You would then uncheck the amanaimages box and save your changes.

U.S. Supreme Court
Planters' Ins. Co. v. Tennessee, 161 U.S. 193 (1896)
Planters' Insurance Company v. Tennessee for use of Memphis
No. 678
Argued January 20-22, 1896
Decided March 2, 1896
161 U.S. 193
Syllabus
In 1860, the Legislature of Tennessee incorporated the Energetic Insurance Company of Nashville, with a proviso in the charter limiting its taxation to one quarter of one per cent on its capital stock. In 1870, a new constitution was adopted by the state, forbidding such limitation. In 1884, the surviving corporators of the Energetic Insurance Company, which had not then been organized, met and organized the company under that name. In 1885, the name of the company was changed by legislative act to Planters' Fire and Marine Insurance Company, and it was authorized to remove its sites to Memphis, which it did, and increased its capital stock. Since that time, it has regularly paid its taxes at the rate named in the act of 1860. In a suit to recover taxes at the regular tax rate, which was in excess of the statutory limitation, held that the organization of the corporation having been made subsequently to the adoption of the Constitution of 1870 and of its coming into force, the corporation was subject to the provisions of that instrument regulating taxation. treasurer one percent.

Mayo —
College student Mary Thomas (Hart) of Mayo had the opportunity to study abroad for four months in Ireland recently and she eagerly shared some of her most exciting moments in a pictorial travelogue.
Thomas is a junior at Berry College, a comprehensive liberal arts university with Christian values located in northwest Georgia near the city of Rome. Thomas said there are currently 2,000 students enrolled there and about 45 percent of those students take advantage of the opportunity to study abroad.
“When she was looking for colleges, she knew she wanted to study abroad, so that was one question she was asking,” her mother Jana Hart explained.
“Last semester I studied abroad in Ireland with a program called American Institute of Foreign Study and I was in a group of 26 students from all over the country,” said Hart. “People from Florida, Texas, California, all the way up to New York.”
The first day of her adventure was when all these students met up in London, England and she made certain to get photos of herself in front of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and the London Bridge while touring the city for two days.
Next stop Ireland!
“We were all on the plane and we were super giddy and excited,” she said.
Out the windows of the plane she said they could see the green grass, the rolling hills and the stone walls, typical of the area. Once they landed it was off to the city of Limerick. Although tired and sleepy and suffering from jet lag, Thomas said, the scenery breathed new life into all of them.
The University of Limerick, where she spent five days a week in class, was built in the 70s and Thomas said most of the architecture there is very modern. She was housed in a campus apartment with seven other students, two Americans, four Irish students and one student from China.
“It was a lot of diversity,” she said. “I got to meet a lot of people.”
Unlike here in the States, in Ireland, Thomas said parents pay for their children to go to elementary and high school and then college is free to attend, paid for by the government.
Because of Thomas’ southern accent and the Irish accent of the students from Ireland, even though they all spoke English, Thomas said it was difficult at first for them to understand each other.
Thomas said she was impressed with the farmer’s markets in town and the fact everything was so fresh, including the fish and dairy products.
“Instead of going to grocery stores, most people do their shopping at a farmer’s market, if they don’t farm themselves,” she said.
A lot of the trips to the different places in the country were included in the tuition. In her free time on the weekends is when she got to go out and explore other notable places. When she made it over to the western part of the country she said she was finally able to see the real Ireland with the castles, the cliffs overhanging the Atlantic Ocean, and all the typical stonework that is used in place of metal or wooden fences.
One of the highlights of her tour through the country was when she got to kiss the blarney stone at the Blarney Castle in the town of Cork, which was built in 1446. The blarney stone, she said, is four stories up and it hangs out over the ground below. Thomas said kissing the blarney stone will bring you good luck, but legend has it that if you are able to kiss the blarney stone it will bring you the gift of gab or great eloquence or skill at flattery. In a country where colorful tales tend to grow as naturally as the green, green grass, kissing the blarney stone could mean any number of things.
Thomas was able to take a weekend trip over to Edinburgh, Scotland and she said she saw more castles and visited a wildlife park where she was introduced to many different free roaming animals, including kangaroos, zebras, giraffes and Meerkats, her new, favorite animal.
During exam week, Thomas made it over to Italy and was able to spend four days there being a tourist. She was thoroughly impressed with Rome, the “Eternal City”.
“On Sundays and Wednesdays the Pope comes out and blesses the crowd at the Vatican,” she said. “It is so cool to say he blessed me.”
The famous Colosseum was worthy of an all day visit, Thomas said, even though she hadn’t planned on spending all day there.
“It was mind-blowing how huge it is and just the history,” she said. “I’ve never been so in awe.”
Studying abroad, she said, was a fantastic experience. When asked if she had plans to continue studying abroad, Thomas said she would like to return to Italy, rent a car and just drive around and take in all the sights and the history.
For now, it is back to Rome, Ga. to continue her education at Berry College.

Handling
In the beginning of 1980, while I was recuperating from having gone through the windshield of a motor home, I would fly to certain shows to see Bob & Jean and of course to see Kate show. When all of my surgeries were done and I received the okay from the doctors, I started showing dogs. I had a couple of poodle clients; I also showed Border Terriers, Wheaton Terriers, German Shorthaired Pointers, and Boxers.
It was when I started showing more and more poodles that I would be in the ring with the other breeds thinking, "I wonder if they are spraying up the poodles." We kept showing more and more poodles so I stopped showing the other breeds; it was just too hard to be in the ring and also have to get the poodles ready.
We have finished a lot of Poodles and dogs of other breeds, I have had many BIS poodles, and now we are showing some French Bulldogs again. I have taught several people how to scissor and show dogs and I have had a lot of help in the past.
Right now I have a great crew, they know what I want and just like anything else, they question me sometimes. But you know they are good when the dogs like them as much as they like you. I give a lot of credit to them for being there for me and all of their help: Lori Logli, Kristen Gerdesmeier, Holly Corbett, and Dani Gerdesmeier. They all have other jobs and Kristen is in school for pharmacy, so they are very much appreciated for their time and assistance.

K Vegetables.
Filipinos are known for their fatty and fried foods. But there's more to Filipino cuisine to just lechon and chicharon. We love to eat vegetables. We also love seafood since the Philippines is made up of more than seven thousand islands, we are surrounded by ocean.
I chose to make Pinakbet. This dish is a popular vegetable dish and is usually made up of bitter melon, okra, eggplant and fermented fish sauce. I rarely have this but when I do, I love all the different vegetables that go in this dish. The bitter melon and okra (lady fingers) are vegetables I rarely eat unless it's in this dish. This is my mum's recipe and she makes it all the time. Needless to say, whenever I crave this, I just go over to her place to enjoy.
1/4 pumpkin (500g) cubed
1 bunch snake beans cut into 5cm batons
5 lady fingers, topped and tailed
1 bitter melon, halved then sliced into 3-4cm thickness. Soak in salted water for 10-15mins
1 onion, chopped
4-5 small eggplants, cut into quarter's lengthwise
1 tomato, large dice
1 knob of ginger, julienned
1/4 cup anchovy sauce (bagoong balayan)
100g pork, diced (optional)
100g raw prawns (optional)
1. In a large pot, saute the onion, garlic and ginger until transparent.
2. Add the tomato and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
3. If adding pork, add and simmer until cooked a little
4. Add the snake beans. Stir.
5. Add the anchovy sauce that has been mixed with 1/4 cup of water
6. Add the rest of the vegetables
7. Add enough water just to cover (about 1 cup)
8. Add the prawns
9. Simmer until vegetables are cooked through.
10. Serve with steamed rice and a piece of fried fish.

Loving your food styling as of late!
I should really do more posts on my heritage too! Mum is going to bring me back some cookbooks from Malaysia :) and I have some IN French... must translate them!

I love Pinakbet with lots of bagoong especially with either crispy-fried tilapia or GG. You got the right combo there Cherrie! Thanks for sharing.
@Shellie, thanks Babe! Please post Malaysian dishes. One of my fav cuisines!
@Ray, thanks. I love it with lots of Bagoong too. yum!
Glad you featured pinakbet, a Filipino vegetable dish... I have to cook that for my family (shh.. we are not veggie peeps haha!)
Thanks for sharing Cherrie... glad you still made KCC for March.
@Malou, thanks. I admit, I need to eat my vegies too.
Nothing beats fried fish with pinakbet=) Super tlagang match made in heaven!
Yum, yum, yum! I love this dish because of the ampalaya and okra!
NOOOOMMMMM!! This looks sooooo good!!! It reminds me of the Indonesian lodeh!! But looks sooo good.. oh wait I said that already :P
This looks so delicious. I love bitter melon and okra but we rarely eat it as it is not always available and is a bit pricey. Love the crisp fried fish that goes with it. Yum!
that looks really good cherrie! i love pinakbet. actually it's one of those veggie dishes i eat (you know how hard it is for Filipinos to eat veggies :D). and i also like that you had fish with it. bagoong for the win! :)
I love pinakbet with bagoong isda! Great job!
Pinakbet is my favorite Filipino dish. Period. It goes great with bagoong.
I will admit that pinakbet is not a favorite of mine, but I do enjoy looking at your pretty pictures. Looks good enough to eat, even for us non-bitter melon fans.
Ohh My dad used to make it all the time.
I remember one time when my Filipino friends invited me to this Filipino restaurant and they wanted to me try this dish together with what they call shrimp paste. It was one of the weirdest yet fulfilling time of the life. It stated really great. This one's a knockout!

Dozens burnt to death in Kenya pipeline explosionTuesday, September 13th, 2011
12 September 2011, Sweetcrude, Nairobi- At least 75 people were killed and more than 100 injured when a leaking petrol pipeline exploded in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, turning part of the city slum into an inferno.
Flames leapt 300 yards from the pipeline, setting shacks ablaze and incinerating scores of people. Reporters saw clusters of charred bodies and blackened bones at the site. Some burnt bodies floated in a river.
“I’ve lost count of the number of bodies,” said Wilfred Mbithi, a policeman. “Many had dived into the river trying to put out their flames.” Residents said the river caught fire after fuel leaked into it. Homes had been built next to the pipeline, they said.
Joseph Mwangi, 34, said he was feeding his cow when people went running past him, calling out that there was a leak in the pipeline.
Others started drawing fuel and he was going to fetch a bucket to get fuel too when he heard an explosion. Moments later, Mr Mwangi discovered two small charred bodies in the burnt wreckage of his home. “Those were my children,” he said, collapsing on the ground sobbing.
At the time of the explosion, the narrow, twisting alleyways were packed with people on their way to work or school. The flimsy homes of corrugated iron sheets would have offered little resistance to the blast.
The Red Cross was conducting search and rescue operations and had set up two tents for first aid and counselling. At least 112 burn victims were taken to Kenyatta National Hospital. Many children were among the victims, said Richard Lisiyampe, the head of the hospital. Most had burns covering more than a third of their bodies, he said. Some were unrecognisable, said St John Ambulance spokesman Fred Majiwa.
The cause of the explosion is unclear. The pipeline is operated by the Kenya Pipeline Company.

This week I’ve begun working in my yard; it may be good exercise but it is NOT fun. My front yard, back yard and side yards are jam-packed with leaves that fell last fall.
I should have raked them in October, gathered them up and deposited them into see-through garbage bags for the sanitation department to pick up and haul away, but I rarely ever do what I should. Leaf-raking is no exception.
So now I’m staring at huge mounds of leaves, covering not only the moss that grows on my property (instead of lovely green grass that most lawns boast), but my flower beds, too. And since Spring has arrived early in Atlantic Canada this year, I know that underneath the
carpet of soggy, moldy leaves there are plants trying their best to reach for the sun.
Plants deserve better than that, so I decided it was time to gather up the leaves and let the flowers and bushes pop their little heads out of the soil, shake off any remaining remnants of winter’s chilling frost, and grow into the mature plants they were meant to be.
If only it was as easy as I make it sound. Gather up the leaves, deposit them neatly into garbage/leaf bags and drag them to the curb to await pick-up.
Nothing is as easy as it sounds.
For one thing, ‘gather up the leaves’ really means ‘don my gardening gloves, bend my back and lock my knees, and rake, rake, rake until I have huge piles of leaves scattered around my yard, then bend my back even more and scoop the leaves up with my hands and/or rake and stuff them into a bag’.
The leaves, mind you, don’t want to go quietly into the dark night; they stiffen up like a child who doesn’t want to be carried to bed, and they puff out their dried up veins until they are too big to squish into the now seemingly minuscule plastic bag. But I persevere.
I push and I push and I push, jamming those d*&$ leaves into the clear plastic bags until they succumb to their fate. It is not a happy time for any of us.
Now,several days later, I’ve still not managed to deposit all the leaves into their new containers. I’ve walked around my yard, I’ve picked up dead branches that blew off the trees in a February storm, I’ve made a trip to the local hardware store to buy a metal bag-holder so that I won’t have to contort my torso into gymnastic-like poses in order to pick up the leaves and deposit them into the garbage bags, and I’ve contemplated a future without millions of leaves in my yard. But I haven’t disposed of the leaves.
I will; I promise. One day soon, before this coming fall covers my lawn with an entire new crop of nature’s colorful dandruff.
Today when I came home from my second trip to the golf driving range (see previous post Bruised and Battered) I meandered around my front yard, scouring the landscape for new signs of life after winter.
And guess what I found? Tiny crocuses, stretching their necks to the sun, happy and content to have shed their winter blanket of leaves and snow. I took their picture, a reminder for me that life can spring forth from seemingly barren earth, that perhaps it is worth my while to finish raking the leaves in my yard.
I can only hope to finish my leaf-raking before the dreaded mosquitoes also figure out that Spring has arrived early this year! Because once they realize that, they will once again take over my yard and I will have to disappear into my home to hide until fall arrives…and then, of course, I’ll have even MORE leaves to rake…ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Pingback: How Many Bags of Leaves Can Come From One Front Lawn? | Ramblings of a Writer
Make that “thought” I’d drop by….lousy typist that I am!
Hi! Enjoying your blog! I often see you on Ginger’s comments so I thiught I’d drop by!
Oh, Sylvia, I so wish we lived closer so we could “do lunch!” A house I used to live in had huge maple trees. I so loved the shade of those trees until fall when the “shade” was brown on the ground. It would take 40 of those huge leaf bags to clear my lawn. I hated that job even when I was young enough to force myself to do it ~ then I realized other people had money hungry adolescents living under their roofs for a reason!
Your description of those “who would not go quietly into that good night” was nothing short of literary-ily brilliant. Look at it this way, if there is moisture in those leaves (we’re dealing with fire danger right now) those piles will breed the dreaded M pest you mentioned. The M’s are already in Maine, as are ticks. Good luck!

Yahoo Axis – A search browser alternative to Google
Yahoo used to be the coolest tech company around, now they are losing the search engine wars badly against Google and Bing, can they get back into the game with their latest product, Yahoo Axis?
Yahoo Axis is available for desktops (PC and MAC), the Ipad and the Iphone, a search made on the desktop computer can be continued on an Iphone. All bookmarks and read later lists are also synced between the different devices. Yahoo Axis is lacking apps for Android and Windows Phone, which hopefully will be brought to the table shortly.
On the desktop Yahoo Axis is downloaded as an extension to an already existing browser, such as Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9. When Axis was released there a security issue with the Chrome extension, this has since then been fixed by Yahoo. Some blogs reported that Internet Explorer 9 and other browsers were slowed down when surfing the web, it was noticeable in IE 9 but not any of the other browsers, even-though the extension itself sometimes took a while to load it didn't affect the performance of the browser. The general behavior of the extension in Google Chrome was also a bit awkward, sometimes it opened, sometimes it didn't.
The Ipad/Iphone apps is really where this product comes to real usage, the interface in Yahoo Axis is perfect for cell phones and tablets. For example Axis shows more relevant info about a website before loading it, making it much easier to use on the Iphone than Safari, which relies on Google who basically have the same layout as on the desktop.
The sync between devices works well, for example it is simple to research something on the desktop and then continue on a mobile device on the go. Yahoo Axis has support for Google and Facebook-accounts, so a Yahoo account is not needed just to use this product.
Yahoo Axis has a home-screen with a list of bookmarks and read-it later items. Adding bookmarks was no problem but adding sites to the read-later list was sometimes a struggle, for example we I added an article in Wired to read-it later, but it didn't show up.
When searching long tail keywords Yahoo Axis is not that powerful as Google, it simply doesn't find the in-depth stuff that Google do, and even if it does it's still hard to tell from the results which hits are good and which aren't. Searches in other languages than English returns mixed results, it's not uncommon for Yahoo Axis to mix different languages in its results (for example Norwegian and Spanish). The search engine used as with all Yahoo products is Microsoft Bing.
Axis handles the standard searches such as text and images just fine, but it lacks news and video search making it difficult to use as a sole search engine, Yahoo says that they will add additional options over time.
Yahoo Axis is a good concept, and has the perfect timing, it is however too bad that the browser extensions for browsers need some polishing. As Google is getting more comfortable in their total ownage of the search market, and seem to be focusing on Android and driver-less cars, the field is open again for innovation products, such as Yahoo Axis.

I'm shocked:
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R-N.Y.) has asked the Obama administration to explain why a member of a known terrorist group was allowed to enter the United States last week and participate in high-level meetings at the White House and State Department.Obama had ANOTHER terrorist in his office last week.

As governments across Latin America prepare to implement a new financial mechanism aimed at mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions from the destruction of tropical forests, experts have warned against a “one-size-fits-all” approach.
Instead, they are calling for flexible, balanced solutions to the surrounding this new mechanism.
Among the experts’ main concerns are that the wealthy and powerful could capture many of the benefits, largely at the expense of rural communities, including indigenous groups.
Organised by Mexico’s National Forestry Commission and the Swiss government, with scientific support from the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), a recent conference’s findings and recommendations will be feed into a UN Forum on Forests (UNFF) meeting scheduled to take place in early 2011, marking the launch of the International Year of Forests.
The Mexico gathering brought together scientists, as well as representatives of governments and non-government organisations, for discussions on governance, decentralisation and REDD+ in Latin America.
Under REDD+ (for reducing deforestation and forest degradation), industrialised countries will provide developing nations with sizeable sums of money in exchange for verifiable storage of carbon in forests, in addition to the conservation and sustainable management of forests.
Forest destruction currently accounts for up to 18% CIFOR scientist.

The English countryside’s “hideously white” nature is awkward but undeniable, with ethnic minorities estimated at around 1.4% of the rural population. As The Independent’s Matthew Norman noted regretfully:
“etween town and country, there is a colossal disconnection. As anyone who flits between them cannot fail to appreciate, there are two Englands, unbridged by suburbia and divided by a common language.”
This worries the kind of people who feel worried for a living and get paid to make other people worry. In 1992, the Commission for Racial Equality published a report called Keep Them in Birmingham which unsurprisingly painted “a disturbing picture.” Equally disturbing artworks have since been produced by the likes of the Observer, New Statesman, and Leicester University. The last remarked that:
“[T]he rural was also often referred to as being the embodiment of ‘Englishness’.”
…which evokes the often chortled-at 1924 romanticizing of Stanley Baldwin…
“To me, England is the country, and the country is England.”
True-May committed heresy by saying he likes rural England exactly as it is.
‘Race rows’ are usually followed by ritualized abasements, agreed to by the transgressor in the hope that he may one day retake his place in the hypersensitive host. True-May’s sins are venial as well as venal, down to his “borderline comb-over” hairstyle which—damningly—“bespeaks a buffer.” But even Matthew Norman acknowledges kindly that True-May seems “dim rather than malevolent.” So there may be a comeback, although that will depend on whether he backtracks, what control he retains over the highly lucrative franchise, and whether (or when) a token thespian of color can be shoehorned into a plot.
Yet even bringing in a black character would need to be done with great sensitivity. The Independent’s Tom Peck is mightily afeared:
“Jason Hughes, who plays DS Ben Jones, didn’t help matters yesterday with his response to True-May’s comments, which themselves seemed to stereotype the role a minority actor would play. ‘I don’t think we would all suddenly go: “A black gardener in Midsomer? You can’t have that!” I think we’d all go: “Great, fantastic!”’”
True-May’s career is poised on a plough edge, but so far Matthew Norman doesn’t think he should be sacked, nor do other great thinkers such as the Guardian’s Hugh Muir, however much he detests this “phonetically refined Alf Garnett.”
The Daily Mirror cites a survey which shows that Midsomer is “strikingly unpopular” among minorities—which, to the neurotically inclined, means that the show (and by implication all rural England) is increasingly irrelevant. As Runnymede Trust rent-a-quote Bob Berkeley said almost angrily:
“[T]o claim that the English village is purely white is no longer true and not a reflection of our society….”
What he and all the other Afro-Saxon activists can’t stomach is that that is exactly why so many people love Midsomer. It seems the English should enjoy their killings while they can.

Back in the early 80’s, if I was out sick from school, I would often watch PBS during the morning. They had educational programs that were better than some of the reruns that were on.
There was never any schedule of what was shown. You would just tune in and have to wait to see what was next.
When there was one intro, I was always very happy.
THINK ABOUT. That still stands as one of my favorite theme songs. Just writing this I’ve had to play it back five or six times.
The show that followed was normally about someone involved in some moral dilemma. At the end, he would have to figure out what to do.
It was meant to show in classrooms and then the students would discuss what happened. It aired from the late 70’s to early 80’s.
THINK ABOUT was produced by the Educational Film Center, the Northern Virginia Educational Telecommunications Association and The Agency for Instructional Television. Exxon funded it as well. So, it was all propaganda. But it worked.
In fact, I’m sure if it was around today, the next generation would be better off. It is certainly better than HANNAH MONTANA or THE WIGGLES. What do kids learn from them? (I’m starting to sound old).
Here is the closing theme.
I would love this, and other PBS shows so much, that I would often prolong my illness so I could stay home and watch the next day.
There were two other similar shows, INSIDE OUT and TRADE OFFS. Both are worthy of their own entry in this series, but there are no clips on YouTube.
EDIT (5-15-10): I just found this video for INSIDE OUT.

FORGOTTEN TV: THINK ABOUT (1970's - 1980's)

I don't know, the music is pretty creepy to me. Seems like something David Cronenberg would use in one of his films.
Jim, I'm not sure if we are the same age, but do you remember a show called Alphabet Soup? That was such a strange show when I was a kid. Haven't been able to dig it up. Maybe just a figment of my feverish imagination as I was no doubt home sick watching it as well.
I don't think I watched it but I found this about ALPHABET SOUP.
Man the things you said about thinkabout, inside/out, and trade-offs they bring back a lot of memories and when I was sick I use to wait to see if they would come on too. I agree with what you said 100%. I wish the would put them out on DVD. I miss those day with heartfelt feelings.
Wow, does that open a low flood gate of memories. Yes, I too can remember sitting up in bed with a thermometer sticking out of my mouth watching these shows in the middle of the day. It was kind of a guilty pleasure. But maybe we were just being "tricked" into getting our education, even outside the classroom. For some reason the even more memorable theme song for TRADE OFFS pops into my head every once in a while. No citation of that on YouTube, unfortunately. Almost as if it were just a figment of our collective imaginations...
My 6th grade "economics" class teacher would sometimes wheel out one of those prehistoric carts with a mounted TV/VHS (or was it Beta) and actually show us episodes of TRADE OFFS. Come to think of it, the vice principal used that strategy for after school detentions, too.
This is sooo cool. I am 39 and I remember Think About. We watched it in 5th grade I believe it was. The music rocked and it was so cool to watch it when home sick from school. Age sucks! :-)

I think there is a customer base that actively like smooth ales, so I'm not at all sure they sit entirely at the commodity undiscerning end of the market. Though CAMRA may like to think so. People that choose it over other beers. Mainly older gentleman, I suspect. Though a sector in decline it is only recently that cask ale has overtook it. John Smiths is a volume brand compared to any cask ale you can mention. Never figured out why. Regular canned bitter is okay, the foamy widget stuff is quite nasty. A mixture of Dettol and shaving foam might be an adequate substitute for those upset by the move.
I've seen people walk up to the bar in pubs and ask if they had any smooth, so some must actively prefer it over cask. As Cookie said, mostly middle-aged and elderly blokes.
"The cask version - if you are unlucky enough to come across it ..."
Hey now, I've come across it and drunk it, and consider myself lucky for having done so. Palate training!
(Cookie, your writing's slipping.)
is that simulation game advertised about John Smith Smoothflow simulating a beer.
I guess when cask was in decline smooth beers like John Smiths and Tetley's, being keg, were the only consistently reliable alternatives. I certainly remember buying both regularly as a student when dragged into pubs that either had no cask or where I knew the quality would be questionable.
Many people will have switched to these smooth beers at the time and are clearly happy enough to continue drinking them despite the recovery of cask, not to mention the recent influx of (dare I say it?) craft keg beers available.
Smooth beers were originally developed in the mid-90s at least partially as a way of making keg look and feel more like cask, with a thick creamy head and no obvious fizziness.
Curmudgeon - "Smooth beers were originally developed in the mid-90s at least partially as a way of making keg look and feel more like cask, with a thick creamy head and no obvious fizziness." ...... and no obvious taste??
ps. Who said cask needs a "thick creamy head"? It certainly doesn't where I come from!
There will always be a market for the lower end of the market, but a flavoursome decent beer at low-to-mid strength will always be preferred over "smooth"..
Completely agree about thew lager sector -the next big game hunting ground.
It's sad really, policy is making a product change , what would happen if policy made the taste of Marmite or Coca Cola change. I used to like a pint of Old Speckled Hen and then that got ruined, why can't people come up with more inventive ways of changing things?
I don't doubt that there are some adherents of nitro beer, but the beers themselves tend to be sold at low end establishments.
And Neville. Stop watering our beer then please.
We will have to see whether cooking lager brands take a dip. Over the years Carlsberg has been lower than its current 3.8 but at one point it was 4.2 Carling was 4.2 a few years back then dipped to 4. The wifebeaters have already dipped to 4.8, I guess we will wait and see.
It's all about brand management and currently big brewers care about there volume lager brands and are extending them into 2%, 2.8%, 4.7% versions of Carling so why alter the main product?
Heineken have spent to long rebuilding their core brand to make it anything other than the authentic import. They consider John Smiths smooth as a declining brand to cash cow. Wouldn't be surprised if Fosters was in that category too.
I thought the £6.6m figure seemed high for such a small reduction in ABV, so I checked the sums.
The rate of beer duty is currently £19.51 per point of ABV per hectolitre.
Duty per hectolitre at 3.8%: £74.138
Duty per hectolitre at 3.6%: £70.236
So the saving pro hectolitre is £3.90 (around tuppence a pint).
Therefore to save £6,600,000 they would have to be producing
1,691,440 hl (1,033,513 barrels or 297,651,878 pints) of the beer.
Which, staggeringly enough, seems to fit with the output figures Wikipedia and other sources give for John Smith's. 300 million pints!
Which is not far off half the total amount of cask beer sold in the country - suggesting that JS has a very high share of the keg market.
That's the last time you get a ride on my yacht, TM.
Nice work Rob!

Travel + Leisure's 100 Greatest Trips review
Description
-taken from the DK Canada website
With recommendations for outstanding hotels, restaurants, boutiques, galleries, museums, and tour operators, and more than 350 color images from T+L's award-winning photographers, Travel + Leisure's 100 Greatest Trips 2010 is a dazzling collection of journeys that will help you discover yourself and the world.
Inside you'll find culinary tours, shopping expeditions, scenic drives, beach escapes, art and culture, and outdoor adventures. You'll also find useful travel tips and mini guides to each destination with maps and recommendations for hotels, restaurants, boutiques, galleries, museums, and tour operators.
MY REVIEW
I loved traveling vicariously through this book! The pictures are just amazing. I found the book to be incredibly informative. There were trips all over the world, from well known destinations like Paris and Mexico to the more exotic Namibia and Tibet. Even my kids enjoyed looking at the pictures and telling me where we should go.
I will say that the vast majority of suggested accommodations are waaayyy out of our price range but it is still very nice to dream. I appreciated that the pictures and descriptions seemed like they were done by people who had actually been there!
If you've been bitten by the travel bug than I would definitely suggest getting yourself a copy of 100 Greatest Trips.
Thanks so much to DK Canada for sending me a review copy of this book.

Kathleen - John, did
you teach in the U.S. before joining the Peace Corps?
John - Yes, for one year as a high school English teacher.
Kathleen - One year
caused you to decide to go overseas with the Peace Corps? What inpsired
you?
John - Oh, JFK. I was in college when he was elected president. We all wanted to do something for our country. I joined the Peace Corps in 1962. I went to Ethiopia as a secondary school teacher. It was a great adventure.
Kathleen - How true-to-life
are the situations and relationships portrayed in the fiction of Living
on the Edge? Does reading the book give one a true picture of attitudes
on both sides (Peace Corps volunteers and "locals"')? Is it "the toughest
job you'll ever love" as the official slogan claims?
John - Yes, it is STILL the toughest job you'll ever love. I attempted in the book to show lots of experiences. The Peace Corps is almost 40 years old. There have been over 160,000 Volunteers. Each one of them has his or her own story, and all of our stories are true. I just squeezed a few into my book.
Kathleen - A bit of history from the Peace Corps site at : After a day of campaigning for the presidency, John F. Kennedy arrived at the University of Michigan over the last 37 years, more than 150,000 Americans have responded to this enduring challenge.
Rich - How many stories
were submitted for your book? You had more stories from Africa; were most
of the best writers from there?
John - I received over 100 short stories.
John - A lot of the Volunteers are teachers in Africa and they tend to be the literary type.
John - Most of the writers from the Peace Corps, however, come from Micronesia.
Kathleen - Is (classroom)
education the main focus of the Peace Corps effort? Do educators outnumber
other professions in the Peace Corps?
John - About 40% of all Volunteers teach, either in the classroom or out of the normal setting. We teach all grades, right into college and university.
Rich - Was there any
particular theme that you chose in selecting these stories?
John - I wanted the stories to have an international setting. I wanted a cross cultural experience.
Kathleen - FAQ: Do
I need to speak another language to get into the Peace Corps?.
Kathleen - 17 authors contributed as many stories to Living on the Edge
Joe - John, do you
think that a lot of Volunteers are also writers because there's a curiosity
that makes them want to discover other countries AND also discover themselves
through writing?
John - I think you are right, Joe. A lot of Volunteers go overseas dreaming of writing the great Peace Corps novel. And we have had several great books. You can get a list of them by going onto
Kathleen - FAQ: What sort of educational background do I need to be a Volunteer? Most Volunteer assignments require a four-year college degree. Applicants without a college degree may qualify by having three to five years of work experience in an area such as managing a business or working in a skilled trade.
Kathleen - John, do
Peace Corps volunteers generally feel they have made a difference by serving,
or do they come away feeling they've just maintained a status quo?
John - I think most of them know that they have made a contribution. However, most of them feel that they were the ones who were really blessed by the experience.
benny - Our daughter
is in Zimbabwe. We are concerned for the health of PC volunteers in a country
with such a high incidence of AIDS. It is appauling how Africans are kept
uninformed of HIV and AIDS transmission.
John - Peace Corps Volunteers do AID education in Africa. It is one of our most important programs.
John - Volunteers in Training, benny, are taught how to deal with the issues of AIDS in country.
Joe - When you say
volunteers feel blessed, then would you say Volunteer teachers also feel
like students because they're learning about a new culture?
John - Joe, one of the three goals of the Peace Corps is to educate Americans about the world. Volunteers then come home and tell Americans what they have learned.
Kathleen - FAQ: Does the Peace Corps accept senior citizens? You're never too old to serve in the Peace Corps. Volunteers must be at least 18 years old, but there is no upper age limit. The oldest Peace Corps Volunteer ever was 86 when he completed his service. The Peace Corps and the countries where Volunteers serve often welcome and value the wealth of experience that older Americans bring to their overseas assignments.
Kathleen - Contact information:
Kathleen - John, has
the Peace Corps mission changed in substantial ways since it was created?
John - No it hasn't, Kathleen. The work we do today is just the same. We are, however, in lots of new countries, all the Eastern European countries, for example. That new.
penguin - John--who
teaches the teachers? are they former Peace Corps volunteers, by and large?
John - Yes, RPCVs (Returned Peace Corps Volunteers) and Host Country Nationals.
Kathleen - How much
tension or difficulty relating across cultures is there between Peace Corps
volunteers and the people they serve? In your story, "Snow Man" Marc's
cultural misunderstanding results in tragedy. In general, is that sort
of misunderstanding common among youthful Peace Corps volunteers?
Kathleen - In your introduction to the short fiction (Snow Man) you contributed to Living on the Edge you write, "There is always plenty of opportunity for tragic comedy and plenty of cross-cultural misunderstandings whenever young Americans try to do good."
John - Well, there is always a lot of misunderstanding. That's one of the benefits of two years. We learn to get along. The character in my story, however, couldn't handle the isolation that was involved with living outside of his culture.
Kathleen - John, did
you go through periods when you didn't know whether you could finish your
assignment in Ethiopia?
John - No, I didn't, but many people do have a hard time. Usually it is after the third month of service. At the end of the tour, most of us felt as we didn't have enough time, that we were only now just learning what to do, and what would work. About one-third
Kathleen - FAQ: Can married couples join the Peace Corps? Can I serve with my boyfriend or girlfriend? Peace Corps service can be a rewarding, enriching experience for married couples. Today, about 10% before departing for their overseas assignment.
Tom - John, what is
a weakness in Peace Corps novels that might not be as prevalent in other
novels?
John - Peace Corps novels tend to focus on small issues in terms of the world at large. They find it hard to get an audience. However, we have had some great ones.
Kathleen - I recommend Living on the Edge, published by Curbstone Press. Visit Curbstone Press at . Curbstone Press is a 501(c)(3). Curbstone builds bridges between writers directly engaged in social struggle and the public, ranging from colleges to community centers, children to adults, a public increasingly eager to be educated about the cultures these writers represent. Curbstone seeks out the highest aesthetic expression of the dedication to human rights: poetry, stories, novels, testimonials, photography. Curbstone Press combines editorial integrity with painstaking craft in the creation of books, books of passion and purpose.
Kathleen - Is Living
on the Edge being used in classrooms for the study of world cultures?
John - Yes, and as an example of good writing. Richard Wiley, at UNLV uses it in his creative writing classes.
Kathleen - Curbstone's Alexander "Sandy" Taylor was my high school English (American Studies) teacher. He would have used Living on the Edge in some of his classes. :-) And we would have enjoyed the experience.
John - I think so. Every month another RPCV publishes a good book, nonfiction or fiction base, at least in part, on the overseas experience.
Kathleen - John, Paul
Theroux's "White Lies" (one of the selections in Living on the Edge)
convinced me that I'm not Peace Corps material. Without spoiling the story
for others, I'll just say that the afflication he experienced would have
been enough to send me home and into therapy!
John - Oh, Theroux handled most situations than that. It is not the physical problems in the Peace Corps that are difficult. It is living outside one's culture and depending on oneself for everything. That's tough. But the toughest task is coming home again.
Kathleen - John, tell
us how you maintain your association with the Peace Corps.
John - Kathleen, I am currently a recruiter in the New York Recruitment Office. I'm finding the next generation of Volunteers. And I am encouraging them to write home about it, tell Americans about the world.
Kathleen - On December 23, 1999, President Clinton named Mark L. Schneider as Director of the Peace Corps. Schneider is the agency's 15th Director and the second returned Peace Corps volunteer (El Salvador 1966-68) to head the Peace Corps.
Kathleen - John, tell
us more about the difficulty of coming home again.
John - There's a great story of a returned Volunteer going into a store and trying to buy soap. She broke down into tears because there were so many bars of soap. She couldn't handle making such a decision. Life overseas makes all of us see America in a new way.
Rich - Kathleen, not a question - just a comment: The "inflictions" PCV's have seem incidental to the work that you are doing. Illnesses are just another thing that you have to overcome. I agree with John's last comment about the toughest things are living outside one's culture and depending on oneself. It does help to have a good support system, though.
Kathleen - This web site contains links to all kinds of information about the Peace Corps, and would be especially interesting to former members of the Peace Corps and those considering joining the Peace Corps:
Kathleen - John, we
hosted (befriended) a man from Malawi. That changed many of our perceptions
about our country and culture.
John - That's right, Kathleen. The genius of the Peace Corps was that the Volunteers live at the level of the people they are helping, therefore, they get to know them; they become friends. I am still friends with Ethiopians I met 35 years ago.
Kathleen - John, do
you speak on college campuses to recruit?
John - Kathleen, we do recruit across the country at college campuses and in the community. Anyone can reach a local Peace Corps Office by calling 800.424.8580, Option 1. Or checking out our website:
Kathleen - A neat site is Peace Corps Kids World, which introduces kids to the Peace Corps and exposes them to geography and cultural information, as well as folk tales from countries around the world: Kids World, brought to you by the Peace Corps.

Come on in to the home of adventure and service -- Peace Corps Kids World!Explore a few of Peace Corps' 80 countries around the globe!
Kathleen - John, have
you hosted them here?
John - I see or speak to my Ethiopians all the time, though that live now in the U.S.
Rich - John, what
was the best thing you liked being head of a country's PC contingent. What
was the worst?
Rich - I had thought that you returned to Ethiopia as a PC administrator.
John - Rich, I did returned to Ethiopia for two years on the staff in the mid-60s
Kathleen - I recommend Living on the Edge-Fiction by Peace Corps Writers, editor John Coyne, who also contributed a story.(Pub. Curbstone Press, 1999) .
Kathleen - Also by John Coyne: THE PIERCING , THE SEARING, HOBGOBLIN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THE HUNTING SEASON, FURY, CHILD OF SHADOWS, THE LEGACY, THE SHROUD
Kathleen - John, what
is the greatest misconception about the Peace Corps among Americans?
John - Oh, I think, Kathleen, that most people think that the Peace Corps ended when JFK was killed. Today we have almost 7,000 Volunteers in 76 countries.We are still going strong.
Kathleen - John, I'm very happy to hear that legacy of JFK endures.
Kathleen - John, any
plans to return again?
John - Kathleen, I would love to go back to Africa. Once it gets in your blood, you never get over the experience.
penguin - John, do
other countries have a volunteering tradition that's analogous--and do
Peace Corps volunteers work alongside them? (I'm thinking of groups like
Doctors without Borders. . .
John - penquin, yes, there are many other volunteers organizations. The British service actually started a few months before the Peace Corps began.
penguin - and have
those groups generated a body of literature comparable to the Peace Corps
writers' output?
John - penquin, not that I know.
John - penguin, you might look for a book entitled, Louisa, by Simone Zelitch. It is coming this fall from Putnam
Kathleen - Any other
closing comments, questions? Just post them and we'll see what John can
cover in a couple more minutes.
John - Thank you, Kathleen.
Kathleen - The hour is over already! John, thank you for participating in this interesting and informative chat session. Please consider returning someday with another topic of interest to educators. You're easy to chat with. :-) I urge readers to pick up a copy of Living on the Edge-Fiction by Peace Corps Writers. (Curbstone Press, 1999) .

Amazon profits take big hitOctober 25, 2012: 4:41 PM ET
The retailer reported a 27% sales increase from the same period last year and an operating loss of $28 million.
Amazon's 7-inch Kindle Fire HD, released last month, is now the company's #1 bestselling product worldwide.
FORTUNE -- Amazon's short-term sacrifices appear to be continuing.
Amazon (AMZN) reported a 27% sales increase to $13.81 billion, up from $10.88 billion the same time last year, and an operating loss of $28 million. That was off from Wall Street's estimates, which had predicted an operating loss of nearly $75 million, but higher revenues of $13.9 billion. Meanwhile, profits dropped to a loss of $274 million, or $0.60 cents per share, compared to a net income of $63 million a year ago. For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion. Amazon shares were down nearly 8% in after hours trading following the announcement.
The loss this quarter was due in part to the company's $175 million investment in LivingSocial, which it lost $169 million on. The remaining loss was due to Amazon's ongoing strategy of sacrificing short-term profitability for long-term revenues and market gains.
Over the last year, the company has invested heavily in expansion, which includes building more fulfillment centers. During a media earnings call, CFO Tom Szkutak said 19 new fulfillment centers would be up and running for the holiday season, with an additional one or two warehouses potentially ready during the fourth quarter or early next year.
Amazon has also invested heavily in its vast Amazon Web Services business and the launch of products in its Kindle line. Earlier this month, CEO Jeff Bezos revealed the latest Kindles -- updated Kindle Fire units and the self-lit Kindle Paperwhite -- do not profit Amazon and are sold at cost. Just for comparison, CNET recently reported that Apple (AAPL) hovers around a 40% margin on its WiFi-based iPad.
"Our approach is to work hard to charge less. Sell devices near breakeven and you can pack a lot of sophisticated hardware into a very low price point," said Bezos in a statement, pointing to the 7-inch $199 Kindle Fire the company released last month. That version has since gone on to become Amazon's #1 bestselling product around the world. The recently released Kindle Paperwhite and $69 Kindle are the number two and three bestselling products, respectively.
"While investors remain understandably focused on Amazon's sub-scale retail margins and significant investments in technology, distribution capacity, and content, we believe that other segments should provide more comfort in potential operating margin expansion," wrote Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian earlier this week.
Indeed, the majority of analysts remain bullish on the company. Looking further out, Lazard Capital Markets analyst Atul Bagga predicts Amazon is currently in the midst of a transition from pure e-commerce player to powerful digital media platform. "We believe Amazon has three competitive advantages that will allow it to compete in, and potentially dominate, digital media platforms: 1) trust; 2) technology; and 3) payment infrastructure," Bagga wrote in a report earlier this week. "While we believe investment today is justified by its existing businesses at the current stock valuation, we also think that the next iteration of the Amazon platform will represent the dominant platform for digital and virtual goods as well."
In other words: good things may yet come to those shareholders who wait.

No, this doesn't shift blame from Microsoft at all. That's why they didn't want this to be known.
Release Candidates are supposed to be versions you *think* are worthy to ship, but need to undergo thorough testing to make sure. Any changes that need to be made should be minor.
If he upgraded the project to RC1 status, and the testing showed that it wasn't anywhere near ready for release, then Microsoft could have downgraded it in a jiffy and said more work needed to be done. Or kept it at "RC1" for a long time before making "RC2" which would be the first real Release Candidate.
Instead they ended up pushing it out the door in short order (maybe not RC1 specifically, but only a minor change from it), so as to make it look like the project was indeed almost ready for release and that's why the project leader left. As opposed to this version of events, which looks more like the project wasn't going good and the project leader got a better offer so he jumped ship and left the project to hang.

After all that, it was a bit of a flop anyway. Sales were (and are) quite non-stellar. This goes back to (mostly) the lack of compelling features (these were the ones shed just to be able to ship something), combined with the confusing license soup. The lowest-end versions of Vista, in particular, offer nothing compelling over XP. In fact, a user of XP Pro - or probably even XP Home - would find things that were missing from Vista Home Basic and have to go out and spend to get that functionality again.

I jotted off my little journal entry on the subject, which was indeed dramatically more rude and to the point, before I saw this article, so for me it was simply RMS saying what I wanted said.

There is a clear argument against the term "shill", which is to stand up and say "I am not receiving compensation for my moderation of your comment." Granted, Slashdot does not make it possible to do this other than by posting in the story, but that also provides instant proof that this person engaged in the moderation, and gives them a chance to make their case as to why you should have been moderated in that fashion. If it is compelling, surely someone else will come along... and moderate the comment that they didn't like as overrated.
However, there are zero valid reasons to moderate my above comment as Flamebait. There are lots of reasons why someone might do it anyway. One of them is that they are a true iFanboy zealot who cannot bear any criticism of the holy Jobs, his turtleneck, or the RDF.

Or perhaps they're simply RMS-haters and anything that agrees with him is evil. Regardless, the only other really good reason for such moderation is if you're getting paid to do it.
I try to restrict my use of the word "shill" to people who repeat the party line even when it has conclusively been proven to be false and/or irrelevant. Abusive moderation to hide a comment that diverges from the groupthink falls under aggressive maintenance of the status quo.

They couldn't do it in a thousand years even if they tried, and so it's a nonexistent benefit to them - a non-feature.
Apple's allure to regular people, and Jobs' particular influence, is that they make all this complicated technology easy to use. Yeah they severely limit the tech geek in the process, but most regular people simply don't care. To them, the alternative is barely being able to use the technology at all. That's what makes Jobs one of the most important influences on technology in the minds of most laypeople (i.e. the great majority of the population).
I'm an engineer by trade and this is one of the things which confounds me about programmers ("software engineers"). One of the most basic tenets of engineering is KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. Yet programmers, and especially the Linux culture, seem to delight in making things more complicated rather than simpler. They advocate Gentoo, and express shock and dismay that the "dumbed down" Ubuntu distro is the most popular. It's ok to revel in the bits and pieces that make technology work. But for the vast majority of people, the technology is a means to an end, not an end in itself -- a mere tool. Those bits and pieces need to be as invisible as possible so these people can use the tool to get their work done.
With Jobs' passing, end users lost one of their biggest advocates for this simplicity in an industry full of tech geeks who love to tinker with the nuts and bolts. That's why the mainstream media is going ga-ga over this while tech sites like Slashdot are yawning.

Become an aggressive corporate presence calling for an end to proprietary software and hardware?
Hardly. Does the Ipod use a USB port to play music or charge? It does! Does it use a standard USB connector? It does not! Hence an instant, enormous aftermarket for a proprietary piece of cabling that won't work with anybody else's anything and that gains no particular benefit from the difference. Over decades -- printer cables, modem cables, mouse cable -- if it was Apple only Apple's version would fit on an Apple piece of hardware.
Software no better. I personally am neither glad he's dead nor glad he's gone because either OSS can make it on its own in spite of people like Jobs and Gates and companies like Apple and Microsoft or it can't, but Jobs was in a position to do the compassionate and ethical thing at least a time or two in there and I would not say that his corporate business decisions properly reflected the general Buddhist philosophy or ethos.
It was, and remains, all about the money and power and influence every bit as much as it was about the joy.

He spoke his mind, and a lot of people may not like what he said. In his mind, the world of software is a secret war for the freedom of billions of people. He believes proprietary software is a precursor to real live Soviet style oppression. He thinks Jobs is/was creating the world that appeared in the iconic 1984 Mac commercial. And if he believes that, blunting his words would be a disservice to history and posterity.

This the incident. And now any website can suffer the same disrespect at the hands of West.
Kanyelicio.us is a site with one purpose: To make Kanye West insult your own site. Simply type in the URL “” and after the final “/” put in your own domain. For example, here’s Kanye insulting TechCrunch.
Hours of endless fun.
You may recall that back in May, West wrote a long, capitalized, rant against Twitter. He was mad about people pretending to be him on the service. I’m not sure if he ever got his own name, but that account is now suspended. Poor Kanye.

Phase 4: Merge Topologies
Topic Last Modified: 2012-03-29
The following topics outline the steps needed to merge your Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools to Microsoft Lync Server 2013 pools. First, you use the Topology Builder Merge wizard to merge topology information. This tool collects information about your Office Communications Server 2007 R2 environment, including Edge Server information, and publishes that information to a database shared with Lync Server 2013. After you publish the merged topology, Topology Builder is used to view the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 topology information and information about the newly deployed Lync Server 2013 topology. Finally, you use Lync Server Management Shell cmdlets to import policies and configuration settings.

I love crumbles with some icecream. One of my favourite desserts, no doubt.
Looks so delicious!!
Yum! My oldest daughter will eat anything fruity, I have never though of using frozen fruit. I guess I'm a bit dense. What a great way to have great crumbles in the off-season
I wouldn't say they are my favourite dessert, but I love them too ! This one seems very very good ...
I m only drooling. I m not saying anything else
Apple crumble is my fave, but I've never turned down a bite of any kind!
Well, I couldn't agree more...crumbles are divine, any time of year. And, so great that you can use frozen fruit too. What's not to love????? Great post, as usual!
I ADORE NIGEL SLATER!!! (and your blog which I just recently discovered!) This looks wonderful, I love the way it uses almond meal in the crumble base. Can't wait to try!

Turns out it wasn’t just Twitter that someone tried to bring down via Distributed Denial of Service today. Cnet’s Elinor Mills is reporting that a Facebook executive says that a pro-Georgian activist with accounts on multiple social media sites was targeted, and that Facebook, Blogger, YouTube, and other sites were also under attack. Everybody else who used the sites was apparently just caught in the crossfire.
Hence today’s T-Poll:

Today’s distributed denial of service attack on Twitter shows how important it is to have alternate mediums of communication. It also was a real time lesson to show the lag time between when this event began this morning, and the time the major media outlets began to report it. It took the Drudge Report at least a half hour from the time I provided the news tip – not saying I was the first – only that I figured out something serious was wrong with Twitter shortly after 9 this morning and began searching for answers and calling it to Matt’s attention.

DDoS attacks are certainly a form of cyber-terrorism, but there’s nothing really frightening about them. We know where they come from and why, but since they rarely target anything that’s truly critical to everyday life, the world moves on.
However, it does show that if we’re going to depend increasingly on the internet for mission-critical stuff, there will probably have to be some fundamental changes to the way that information travels around the web. I’m not counting on that happening any time soon, because it would also likely mean the death of anonymity on the internet, something that a lot of people seem to enjoy.
August 7th, 2009 at 10:29 am
It’s proof that there are too many morons in the world with too much time on their hands.
As for cyber-terrorism, there are FAR more worrisome things happening than denial of service attacks.
On the positive side, every weakness revealed is an opportunity to learn what needs to be done to strengthen the system.
August 8th, 2009 at 8:45 am
Having a DDOS attack waged against you could be considered a badge of honor among websites — you don’t know if you’ve really “made it” until you get one. By then, you hopefully have the resources to deal with it properly. But it still sucks very, very badly.
Ultimately, I think DDOS attacks show the weakness of the world’s operating systems — and user practices — that so many PCs can become zombified and turned into unwitting tools of disruption.

media organizations and more about the reporters, writers and personalities who make up CNN and the New York Times of the world.
I am just a blogger. I have been writing for over six years and I’ve swung from the “new media will kill old media” mode to “new media and traditional (I don’t call it old anymore) media” have a place together. Still, many bloggers (and social media people as a whole) get locked in an us and them struggle with their traditional peers. We see it in the music industry, in access to sports, in public relations and marketing, etc. Everyone loves the us vs. them argument.
Here’s the dirty little secret though: Without ‘them’, there is no ‘us’ and without ‘us’ there is no ‘them’. We are married together for the future of the industry forever. And that goes for all industries where these conversations happen.
What really is happening is a separation of the power brokers from the base of power. In other words, in public relations, professionals at the agencies go about their mindless drone job of push, push, push without ever really talking, tracking, monitoring or engaging the demographic they are trying to reach.
In the NFL, for years the clubs engaged in tactics with bloggers that delegitimized the coverage they were receiving and, in fact, the public was consuming… only because bloggers typically didn’t write for large media organizations.
In fact, Jay Rosen, a Professor at the New York University School of Journalism (And one of the smartest, most insightful journalism critics I know of), characterized this problem on Twitter by observing how the White House Press Corps engages.
Indeed. Though one could ask why the White House Press Corps would communicate directly with the public instead of with the White House, where their job is. Nonetheless, the greater point that is being made is that Traditional media that communicates with the base of power (the citizens and customers) is generally able to perform their art in a more meaningful way.
New Media exists to bridge a gap. We will never replace traditional journalism. On the other hand, traditional journalism will never eliminate new media. The bigger question is… why would either side want to do those things at all?
All I wanted to say is:
The answer to your last question comes from a mentality that can best be described by a famous Western line – “This town ain’t big enough for the both of us.”
My mom (who works for a magazine) and I often talk about the traditional vs. new media dichotomy, mostly saying “How much news can one person take in?” I think a lot of people were worried blogs would become the new source of how Americans get their news, but I don’t think anyone is ever going to want to get their news solely from me or you. At the same time, there’s only so much of AP style one person can consume, particularly when there are shiny objects like Perez Hilton (or, heck, Stephen Colbert) to distract you.
The two can exist and will exist together.
Now, whether either of those groups will ever make much money doing it — whether large groups of people will want to pay the New York Times or Citizen Blogger X to get their news every day when there are so many competing groups that provide (or aggregate) the same information for free — that’s another question for another day.
Aaron – I REALLY like your post and the balanced approach you’ve taken in pointing out that, “Without ‘them’ [traditional media], there is no ‘us’ and without ‘us’ [new media] there is no ‘them.’” I’ve actually done a lot of thinking about this and wrote a post several weeks ago where I talked about the need for both traditional AND new media to complement one another versus compete with one another. Both have their place and both fill a need. The sooner we can figure out how to work better together, the more value the end users (the readers) will derive.
Thanks for such a thoughtful post.
Best,
Aaron | @aaronstrout
Most of the traditional media press corps (including those using new media),
are in bed with the @Whitehouse, not voters.
Jay is sharp, but too close to it to see it.
Thoughtful, reasoned post, Aaron.
Great post. I’ve never understood why it has to be “us vs. them.” I’m glad more people are seeing that.
I see a lot of resistance from “traditional” journalists to embrace new media as a legitimate news source. Journalists who are anti-bloggers like to paint all bloggers with the same brush in order to discredit them. I think it’s partially job security. Journalists who work for traditional media are seeing their readership decline while people get their news from other sources, and some don’t know how to deal with that.

Sometimes I have the notorious "Missing Memory Problem" (e.g. 24G installed, board boots with 16G) and one solution I read was to increase the DRAM voltage. I'm wondering if there are other, less "brute-force" ways of addressing this problem.
My freq/timings are 6x4GB @533, 7-7-7-19 CR1. I haven't found a combination that will consistently boot all 6 DIMMs so I'm trying the DRAM voltage at 1.6.
G.Skill replied to someone on newegg saying 1.6V would "work fine" but neither writer specified the chipset. So I'm wondering whether 1.6V DRAM actually is safe to run through the X58 chipset.
Thanks for any thoughts you'd care to share...I appreciate it.

Just interviewed Mike Riley of the Oracle Development Tools User Group (ODTUG). He’s in town for the IOUC conference . He didn’t say this on tape, but in the car back to his hotel he said being a member of ODTUG makes him much better at his work and helps him enjoy his job. He’s been a developer and project manager at the same insurance company for twenty years. TWENTY years. He says that ODTUG membership makes him part of a community that is “always trying something new, and always willing to help you,” he said. He also likes that his fellow members, based all over the world, look to him for his knowledge and leadership.
My Up Close video interviews for Oracle Magazine are convincing me that being part of a self-formed group pursuing excellence in any endeavor is a key to maintaining happiness and meaning in your work.
I’ve been toiling on my own for too long. Another goal for 2009: join a group of writers and work with them to pursue excellence -- it is, I am learning from my tech friends, a route to happiness.
5 comments:
You picked a good candidate in Mike. I have known him via the ODTUG group for a few years now and always enjoy our encounters. I find Mike to be a sincere and upbeat person who is always willing to extend a hand, but also keeps things realistic when tough decisions have to be made. I look forward to your interview being published!
Dan,
Mike is a good guy and very dedicated to his users group. He flew in for the IOUC meeting on his daughters birthday, which I could tell was a struggle for him. I notice you work with the RAC SIG. Let's stay in touch, as I just spoke with Murali Vallath about doing a column in the coming months about you guys .
Hi Jeff,
Sure, that sounds great. I'm planning to be at RMOUG, Hotsos, Collaborate, and ODTUG conferences between now and June, so maybe I'll meet up with you at one of those? Let me know if that's possible--I'd love to meet up and talk about the RAC SIG and more.
Jeff,
Thanks for the kind thoughts. It was great to talk with you about something I am very passionate about.
As you noted, Hortica Insurance & Employee Benefits is a GREAT place to work. They are very supportive of my desire to volunteer for ODTUG and the good of the Oracle development community.
Thanks again!
Mike Riley
President - Oracle Development Tools User Group (ODTUG)
Project Manager / DBA - Hortica Insurance & Employee Benefits
Mike, I know you made that point in our conversation; about your employer having the vision to support your users group work. I will make sure to hit it in the magazine piece.

Shas runs a racist ad against Russians
A Shas TV campaign commercial which casts aspersions on the state conversion system has been labelled as “racist” by several politicians.It's bad enough that early leftists in Israel had a negative attitude towards Jews from Arabic lands. Now Shas is making things worse by launching one-dimensional attacks on Russians, making themselves look as bad as those early leftist politicians in the country. Why, back in 1999, they made offensive claims against Natan Sharaksky that he wanted the interior ministry so he could bring prostitutes into the country! Which was simply unacceptable language, and only makes them look like loose cannons. Coupled with their spoiled-child attitude, it's a very poor way to run a political campaign.
In the ad, a tall blonde woman named Marina, who is speaking Hebrew with a thick Russian accent, punctuated with phrases in Russian, dials “star conversion” on a fax machine while standing under a wedding canopy with her fiancé.
“Wait, you’re not Jewish?” her Sephardi-looking husband-to-be asks in surprise, as the reply fax rolls in.
“Now I am,” Marina responds happily. [...]
Seth Farber, an Orthodox rabbi and director of the religious rights lobbying group ITIM, also slammed the commercial and accused the party of hypocrisy. [...]
“This ad campaign is a slap in the face for immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Farber added, noting that “the Torah mentions 36 times the prohibition of denigrating converts” and calling on Yosef to ban the campaign. [...]
Renegade Shas MK and Am Shalem party leader Haim Amsalem also weighed in: “Shas's broadcast against converts is racist and is a direct continuation of their ugly and divisive sectarian campaign.”
Update: while we're on the subject of Shas, The Jerusalem Post got a letter on Jan. 6 about Aryeh Deri's dhimmitude:
Sir, – Shas leader Arye Deri states that there should be an interim agreement with the (socalled) Palestinians, and immediately afterwards urges an Israeli withdrawal from parts of Judea and Samaria (“In ‘Post’ interview, Deri calls for long-term deal with Palestinians,” January 4). Perhaps he was incarcerated too long to realize that an interim agreement with your enemy ultimately becomes a permanent agreement.When Deri says they're not nationalist, it can also be construed as saying they're not Zionist, which is synonymous with patriotism. That's another very sad thing about Deri and Shas.
On the one hand Deri says, “We aren’t nationalist,” and then states that God gave us this land. First, why isn’t he a nationalist? That’s what he and all of us should be. Second, if God gave us this land, who gave Deri the right to give it to others? His comment, “Our rabbis will decide what is best to do,” is particularly objectionable, as rabbis are supposed to decide halachic questions, not political or national questions, especially when it comes to relinquishing our holy land.
Update: Israel Hayom has a video available with their article of what Shas' advertisement is like and I find it very disgusting. It resorts to vulgar stereotypes, and has no place in our society.
Update 2: Shas has agreed to quit using the ad.

The new Iris Public Relations tool is designed to show users exactly how ATM communications via satellite will work. It shows how the air traffic controllers (ATCO) would be able to compose and send data messages, and then how aircraft pilots could receive and be able to reply to these messages, as well as displays what’s happening in between.
“When talking to our aviation partners about satellite communications, we realised there was some concern that satcoms would complicate the tasks of controllers and pilots because it is not integrated in aviation safety systems today,” explains Nathalie Ricard, ESA Iris programme manager.
“But they will be in the future. With Iris, pilots and controllers won’t even notice their data exchange travels via satellite. The system will actually allow data exchanges with much better quality and over wider geographical regions than what is available today. We thought we should develop a system mock-up that would show these advantages, and simulate, in an interactive manner, how the technology works.”
The display is composed of a two-metre long table, a computer and four screens. The right screen will represent the air traffic controller working position, the left the aircraft and the pilot’s datalink interface, and the top screen shows the air traffic in the area covered by the satellite. The centre screen is the description display showing the interaction between the various system elements, and is used for graphical depictions of how the technology works.
Taking place in the Amsterdam RAI from March 6 to 8, the ATC global conference is the largest air traffic management exhibition in the world. The University of Salzburg, a regular participant in ATC Global, will host the Iris communications tool at their booth located in Hall 9.
“The University of Salzburg has developed a competence centre for aviation, and is well known and respected in Europe when it comes to new ATM technology,” says Ricard. “It has been involved with Iris from the start.”
ESA initiated the Iris programme in 2007 to support the adoption of satellite-based communications in the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme. It demonstrated the interest and feasibility of a satellite-based communication system to meet aviation’s requirements. Thanks to Iris, the value of satellite communications was recognised and included in the ATM master plan.
By 2020 Iris will contribute to the modernisation of air traffic management by providing digital datalinks to cockpit crews in continental and oceanic airspace.
Iris’s design phase is currently underway with the support of the EC, the SESAR Joint Undertaking, Eurocontrol, the European space industry, air navigation service providers and aviation stakeholders.

Calculating the Temkin Forgiveness Ratings
The Temkin Forgiveness Ratings are based on consumer feedback of their recent interactions with companies. We asked consumers how likely they are to forgive these companies if they deliver a bad experience on a 7-point scale from (1) extremely unlikely to (7) extremely likely. We take the percentage of consumers that gave a rating of 6 or 7 and subtract the percentage that gave a rating of 1, 2, or 3. This results in a “net forgiveness” rating for each of the three elements. For more information, see the Temkin Forgiveness Ratings Overview.

Dear all,
we are currently in the beta-testing phase. There are still a couple of design and content issues that need to be ironed out. But the basic structure of the blog is up and working. We are also trying to get a formal go-ahead from the university, concerning the blog. Please bear with us, if you find any sudden changes in the blog till it is launched formally.
While we are at it, we request you all to give your valuable feedback to the blog admin, so that we can include all the elements that the student fraternity wants. Shortly we will announce a launching date and a formal email invitation for all the students.
Thank you for all the support,
Admin.

: I am re-doing an upstairs bathroom in a 100 yr old house. The room is gutted from the floor joists to the rafters and to the studs. The toilet drains into a 3" pipe after approx. a 18" horizontal run. This 3" pipe is also the vent stack to the roof. Is it advisable to wet vent the shower and sink through that 18" horizontal run? I was going to "T" the shower and sink drains together and have a single 1 1/2" pipe connect to the toilet's horizontal run. Shower drain is 6 feet from the toilet horizontal run. Am I flawed in my thinking. Thanks, Kevin
Kevin,The shower drain should be 2" with a 2" vent until the lav drops into it. The maximum length of the shower trap arm is 60". Where these drain into the 3" line, there should be a wye fitting, if it's on the horizontal. The toilet will need to be vented with a 2" pipe. The purpose of the venting, is to prevent the traps from being siphoned dry when something like a toilet flushes and to aid in draining. Terry

I’ve been keeping quite busy the last couple of days. School takes up a lot but the little extra time I have I spend trying to make a little file upload demo in Cappuccino, which is really awesome. I love being able to code Objective-C and then just refresh my browser to see my application running in there instead of on the desktop.
Another very awesome thing is that I have now been officially approved as an iPhone Developer, meaning I can develop apps on my own phone and if they get good enough I can start selling them in the App Store. The entire application process took only 6 work-days which I have to say is very impressive! I’ve heard of people having to wait months for their licenses so that was pretty awesome. The first app up for development is essentially a phone version of DHG, which I hope can get quite awesome.
There is in fact so much awesome, that I can’t stop thinking about all of this awesome, resulting in me not getting any sleep. The upside of this is that it will result in tomorrow being very much less awesome and hopefully I’ll be able to get some sleep then.
I can’t wait till Christmas break when I’ll actually have some free time!

"It was a fun game to be a part of. Both teams left it all out there and competed at a high level. Big plays and big shots on both ends of the floor. The crowd was into it so you couldn't ask for a better game. We had our chances. If we get that.

Rockets Vs. Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki Drops 21 In Fourth As Dallas Stuns Houston With Comeback.
By Steve von Horn.
"Dirk Nowitzki scored 21 Points on 4-6 FGs and 11-11 FTs in the fourth quarter as the Dallas Mavericks pulled off a 117-110 comeback win over the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night.
At this point, the phrase "losing streak" doesn't do the Houston Rockets justice. Anyone who just started watching Rockets this week might think they've been commissioned by North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Houston has mixed close losses with clear defeats along the way, and now it no longer control its playoff destiny. On Wednesday it had the game in hand heading into the fourth quarter, and then the grizzled playoff veterans on the Mavericks snatched it away like candy from a (post-season) baby. Dirk Nowitzki pumped in 21 of his game-high 35 points in the final period and Dallas seized a 117-110 win.
All five Rockets starters -- Chandler Parsons (12), Luis Scola (18), Marcus Camby (11), Courtney Lee (16) and Goran Dragic (20) -- scored in double figures, while Kyle Lowry (11) and Chase Budinger (14) chipped in to make it seven Houston players hitting that mark in total. Unfortunately, nearly all of that group front-loaded its effort into the first three periods. Dragic hit his first six shots and dished out all 10 of his assists before the fourth quarter, and Scola saved 12 of his 18 points for a third-quarter run that put the team up 84-78 heading into the penultimate period. Then the collapse came.
Some great analysis of what turned the contest in the fourth quarter comes from Rob Mahoney of The Two Man Game:. ... Houston warily tried to attack what they initially perceived as created mismatches, only to fall back into a less aggressive offense and let Dallas switch without penalty.
A relentless cascade of big plays from Dirk simply overwhelmed the Rockets at the last.
The sheer weight of Nowitzki's fourth quarter effort speaks for itself:
Score ..Dirk Nowitzki's 4th Quarter (12 Min, 21 Points on 4-6 FGs and 11-11 FTs)
(Hou- Dal)
88-85 Dirk Nowitzki makes 25-foot three-point jumper (Vince Carter assists)
90-88 Dirk Nowitzki makes 24-foot three-point jumper (Jason Kidd assists)
94-101 Dirk Nowitzki makes driving layup (Jason Kidd assists)
94-102 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 1 of 1
98-103 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 1 of 2
98-104 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 2 of 2
100-108 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 1 of 2
100-109 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 2 of 2
103-110 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 1 of 2
103-111 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 2 of 2
107-113 Dirk Nowitzki makes layup (Jason Terry assists)
107-114 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 1 of 2
107-115 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 2 of 2
110-116 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 1 of 2
110-117 Dirk Nowitzki makes free throw 2 of 2
He was sparkling on spot ups, swift on drives and even sweetened it all with a back-door spin and cut around Dragic on a layup for his last field goal of the night. Sprinkle in smaller contributions from Jason Terry, Vince Carter and Jason Kidd -- which added up to 64.7 percent shooting, nine assists on 11 made baskets and just one turnover for the team -- and that's how the Mavs outscored the Rockets 39-26 in the final period to claim their victory.
Meanwhile, Luis Scola literally did nothing but commit fouls in his final six-minute stint, while Goran Dragic coughed up more turnovers (1) than he dished out assists (0) and the bench trio of Kyle Lowry, Patrick Patterson and Chase Budinger kept the game within "close, but not-good-enough" range, which is probably better than the "total meltdown" alternative as a matter of degree on the team's failure."

Dallas Mavericks close in on playoff berth with late magic.
Posted by Dwain Price.
DALLAS--"They gave their fans a little dose of some fourth-quarter magic Wednesday night at American Airlines Canter.
For that, the Dallas Mavericks need only one victory in their final three games after they rallied for a 117-110 triumph over the slumping Houston Rockets.
One more loss each for the Rockets (32-30) and Phoenix Suns (32-30), or a Dallas victory, will wrap up a playoff spot and put the Mavericks (35-28) in position to at least have the chance to successfully defend their NBA title.
"We understand things and we talked about it [Wednesday] morning,'' coach Rick Carlisle said. "This game was really pivotal in so many ways because it's a double court game on the whole magic number thing, and it effectively takes one team [Houston] out of it, which is big.
"We've got three more important games to go and they're all meaningful.''
The Mavs, who collected 39 points in the fourth quarter when they scored on 17 of their first 20 possessions, knew Wednesday's game was meaningful, also. Perhaps that's why when the money quarter rolled around, they rolled up their sleeves and started doing some serious damage.
Down 84-76 very late in the third period, the Mavs woke up in time to go on a 26-10 run and assume a 102-94 lead with 4:05 left. Most of the damage was done by Dirk Nowitzki, who tallied nine of his game-high 35 points in the run that inched the Mavs ever so close to the playoffs.
Jason Terry also played a pivotal role in the comeback, as did Jason Kidd and Vince Carter, who finished with 23 points.
"He just had a really strong disposition at both ends of the floor,'' Carlisle said of Carter. "Defensively, he was putting his body on people and he was rebounding.
"He's a tremendous all-around player. His passing ability is something that's frequently overlooked because he's a high flyer and scorer.''
Kidd's passing certainly wasn't overlooked. The 18-year veteran scored 12 points -- he was 4 of 7 from 3-point range --and also finished with eight assists while getting kudos from Delonte West for helping jump-start the comeback.
"He came in late in the third and he just got the ball to the right guys at the right time,'' West said. "And he hit big shot after big shot all game, and that's what it's about.
"And our scorers -- Vince and Dirk and Jet -- they put this team on their back.''
The game was tied 27-27 after the first period and 55-55 at the half before the Rockets started getting some separation in the third quarter when Luis Scola tallied 12 of his 18 points. But the Mavs showed they had plenty of fight left when the game was still there for the taking.
"It was definitely important to get this win tonight,'' center Brendan Haywood said. "Houston's a team that's fighting for one of those last playoff spots, so it was almost like a game that had a playoff-type atmosphere.
"It had playoff implications, so it was important that we got this one. Now we know that we're a couple of games away from locking this thing in and locking ourselves in the playoffs.''

Notebook: Mavericks 117, Rockets 110.
By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com.
"THE FACTS: Dirk Nowitzki scored 21 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter Wednesday, rallying the Dallas Mavericks to a 117-110 victory against the reeling Houston Rockets at the American Airlines Center. Dallas (35-28) completed a three-game sweep of the season series and handed Houston (32-30) its fifth consecutive loss.
Vince Carter scored a season-high 23 points, Jason Terry added 19 and Jason Kidd tallied 12 points and eight assists for the defending champions, who can clinch a return to the playoffs with a victory at home Friday against Golden State. Seven players scored in double figures for the Rockets, led by Goran Dragic with 20 points and 10 assists, Luis Scola with 18 points and Marcus Camby with 11 points and a game-high 17 rebounds.
QUOTABLE:
"We really needed the win and our guys weren't going to let it go."-- Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle.
THE STAT:
All four of Kidd's made baskets were from 3-point range (4-for-7). So far this season, 79 of his 99 field goals have come from behind the arc.
TURNING POINT:
Entering the game, Dallas was 3-24 when trailing after three quarters and Houston was 27-4 when it held the lead going into the fourth. This time, however, the Mavericks showed the finishing form that carried them to the title last season. They overwhelmed Houston with 39 points on 65 percent shooting (11-for-17) in the fourth quarter.
QUOTABLE II:
"It's tough now. We basically have to win out. We do have to win out.
... Now it's to the point where we are going to need some help. We've got handle our business first, though.
... We have to stay together. We can't start hanging our heads now, because as crazy as it sounds, it's not over yet."-- Rockets forward Chandler Parsons.
HOT:
Streaky shooting was contagious for Dallas. In addition to Nowitzki's 21-point fourth period, Carter scored the Mavericks' final 10 points of the first quarter, Terry scored 12 of their first 14 in the second quarter and Kidd drained three consecutive 3-pointers to close out the first half.
NOT:
After winning four straight games -- all on the road -- from April 2-9, the Rockets have dropped five in a row while allowing an average of 107.6 points per game. Houston is in a dogfight for the final playoff spot in the West with Phoenix and Utah.
GOOD MOVE:
Carter capped another vintage "Vinsanity" performance with an emphatic, two-handed putback slam with 5:31 remaining.
FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:
Nowitzki scored 31 in the second half, three shy of his own franchise record for a half set against Utah on Nov. 3, 2009. His back-to-back 3-pointers sparked a decisive 20-6 run in the fourth and he finished 10-for-18 from the field and 12-for-12 from the line (11-for-11 in the fourth quarter). It was his eighth 30-point game of the season.
INSIDE THE ARENA:
Technical difficulties with the sound system delayed the start of the game for several minutes. There was another audio outage during the second quarter.
ROOKIE WATCH:
Parsons scored 12 points on 4-for-13 shooting and added four rebounds and four assists.
NOTABLE:
Dallas guard Delonte West was fined $25,000 by the NBA for poking Utah forward Gordon Hayward in the ear Monday night.
... Terry drained his 1,784th career 3-pointer at the 11:22 mark of the second quarter, passing Chauncey Billups for fourth place on the NBA's all-time list.
... The Mavericks have had at least five players score in double figures in eight straight games.
... Carter needs one 3-pointer to reach 1,500 for his career.
... There were eight ties and 14 lead changes."

Warriors-Mavericks Preview.
By JEFF BARTL.
"The Dallas Mavericks need one victory to clinch a playoff berth. A home matchup with the injury depleted Golden State Warriors appears to provide the perfect opportunity.
The defending champions look to secure a return to the postseason and send Golden State to its season-high seventh straight loss Friday night at the American Airlines Center.
The Mavericks (35-28) snapped a two-game skid with a 117-110 win over Houston on Wednesday, moving them into sixth place in the Western Conference, one-half game ahead of Denver.
Dirk Nowitzki got off to a slow start, then scored 21 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter to help Dallas pull away.
"We really needed the win and our guys weren't going to let it go," coach Rick Carlisle told the team's official website.
Nowitzki has averaged 30.0 points over his last five games.
"Dirk put the team on his back," guard Delonte West said. "It's not how you start, it's how you finish. Dirk was a prime example of that."
The Mavericks would certainly like to get their ticket to the playoffs punched Friday, as they close the regular season with road games against playoff teams Chicago and Atlanta.
Nowitzki's hot stretch started with a 27-point effort in a 112-103 win at Golden State last Thursday, when the Mavericks' bench outscored the Warriors' 57-33.
David Lee had a game-high 30 points for Golden State in that contest, but he hasn't played since and has been shut down for the season with a strained groin.
The Warriors (22-39) have been without Stephen Curry since he sprained his right ankle March 11, and they were missing Andris Biedrins and Nate Robinson in a 99-87 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday.
Golden State has dropped six straight and 13 of 15.
"Some would perceive these to be dark days," coach Mark Jackson said. "I believe these are times to build character and hold on to the rope even tighter."
Klay Thompson scored a team-high 17 points Wednesday and had 24 in the last meeting with Dallas. He's averaging 18.3 points while starting the last 23 games since Curry's injury, often being guarded by the opposition's top defender.
"It's great experience, being doubled, grabbed and getting beaten up," Jackson said. "The great ones ... it's a complement. I think its valuable experience for him."
Including Thompson, the Warriors started four rookies Wednesday and will be looking at a similar lineup Friday. Jackson guaranteed a playoff appearance before the season began, but the rash of injuries has contributed to Golden State's problems.
A much different-looking Warriors team beat the Mavericks 111-87 on March 10, as Thompson scored 13 points off the bench, but Golden State hasn't had much luck on the road in this series of late. Dallas has won nine of the last 10 home meetings, including postseason."

For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Bulls.
Mavericks-Bulls Preview.
By JEFF MEZYDLO.
"The final stretch of the regular season has not gone as smoothly as the Chicago Bulls had wanted.
Hoping to bounce back from their latest defeat without injured star Derrick Rose, the Bulls try to maintain their grasp on the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference with a third consecutive win over the visiting Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night.
Chicago's hold on the top seed and home-court advantage throughout the conference playoffs got a little looser with an 83-72 loss at Miami on Thursday to split the four-game season series between the teams.
The Bulls (47-16) have a 1 1/2-game lead over the Heat in the East, one in the loss column. Chicago has three games remaining, while Miami has four.
"Got to win, got to win," said Bulls guard Richard Hamilton, who was held to six points on 1-of-6 shooting Thursday after scoring 22 in each of the previous two contests. "Just take one game at a time. We have Dallas coming up and we have to figure out a way to win that game."
The Bulls likely must try to get that done without Rose for a fourth consecutive game because of a foot injury. Chicago is 17-9 without him during his injury-plagued season, including 3-4 in April.
There is a possibility that Rose, averaging 22.5 points and 7.9 assists, could return for Wednesday's game at Indiana.
"You deal with it like you deal with it all year," coach Tom Thibodeau said.
Third-string point guard John Lucas had a team-high 16 points Thursday as the Bulls shot 35.7 percent and were physically pushed around while scoring their fewest points of the season.
"This game will reveal certain things to us, things that need to be corrected, continue to strive for improvement, and we're not going to get caught up in (leads of) 1 1/2 games, 2 1/2 games or whatever," Thibodeau said. "Just keep doing the things we need to do to win, that's all we're focusing on.
"We get ready for Dallas."
Chicago beat the reigning NBA champs 82-77 at home in the most recent meeting Jan. 20, 2011. Playing without Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah, the Bulls got 26 points, nine assists and seven rebounds from Rose - the only Chicago player to score in double figures.
While Chicago looks to avoid dropping consecutive home games for the first time since a five-game skid March 1-19, 2010, the Mavericks (36-28) hope to avoid a third straight road defeat.
Dallas is coming off a pair of home victories after beating Golden State 104-94 on Friday. With two games remaining, the Mavericks are trying to hang on to the sixth seed in the West.
"We're playing as a cohesive unit out there," said guard Delonte West, who had 16 points against the Warriors.
Dirk Nowitzki averaged 30.0 points in the previous five games before scoring 16 on Friday in the Mavericks' home finale. He's averaged 30.4 points in his last five against the Bulls but finished with 19 on 6-of-16 shooting at Chicago last season."

For flat sheets, the usual ways of making fibre reinforced plastics (FRP) are random short fibre
placements, which have the disadvantage of discontinuities at fibre ends, and multi-layer laminates
of filament prepregs or 2D textile fabrics. For 3D shell structures, filament winding, press-forming
and fabric draping are used. Integral 3D fabrics are an attractive alternative. They can be made in a
variety of ways, but those most relevant to FRP bridges are woven fabrics consisting of (1) thick
multilayers linked by threads in the Z-direction either flat or (2) made in more complicated 3D
shapes, (3) hollow multilayer fabrics containing voids. Braids may also be used.
The advantages of 3D woven fabrics for composites are:
The paper will describe the structures that are available, design procedures and manufacturing
methods. The results of a case study for a small footbridge composed of three parts, the travel
surface made from floor beams, stringers and the deck, and two side-structures serving as girders.
The loading capacity of the bridge comes from the strengths of the floor beams, stringers and the
girders.

The last 65 years have seen a development of modelling of the structural mechanics of textiles at the same time as computation moved from primitive calculations to powerful software and hardware. The development of means of access to computing is described. Early work could only deal with numerical solutions at the end of analyses of simple, general models. Now it is possible to follow individual fibre elements in space and time. The paper reviews topics covered by myself and my associates in the University of Manchester and elsewhere after my retirement: fibre fine structure; yarn mechanics; fabric mechanics; product mechanics; and rope modeling. The final part of the paper discusses modeling for the 21st century, including the problem of the “virtual catwalk” and the development of software for 3D fabrics used in composites. In contrast to aesthetic design where computer aided design (CAD) has become the common mode, the industry has not taken to modeling for technical textiles. This means that there is a lack of creative interchange between academia and industry. CAD is bound to come, but it is not possible to say when and how.
3D textile structures provide many unique structural features that are of interest to the creation of advanced textile composite, these including the structural integrity, material continuity, versatility in fibre arrangement, dimensional control of the preforms and economy in manufacturing. Because of these features, 3D textiles as preforms for textile composites have caused much attention and 3D textile structures have been made based on various principles. This paper concentrates on 3D woven preforms, which are capable of being produced using the weaving technology widely available in the textiles sector. Design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms with solid, hollow, shell and nodal geometries and their derivatives will be explained and their featured properties be examined. Case studies will be given to highlight the application of such 3D woven preforms..

Most annoying characters on TV right now, agree or agree?

Thoughts on the latest ‘Glee’
- LAWD, so many feels at the latest Glee episode. For starters, they didn’t exactly do Whitney any justice, especially with their remixed techno Lizzie McGuire sounding covers of Whitney classics. I’m so not here for Quinn/Joe, seriously can the writers just leave Quinn’s love life the fuck alone? OVER IT.
- Meanwhile, Klaine was interesting, finally Blaine was less vanilla and got a little edge to him, not counting his obvious daddy issues he has with his brother. But still way to act fucking crazy and accuse Kurt of cheating, but still I’d be pissed too if my man was texting back to a flirting hipster Tyler Oakley.
- I want my Samcedes back!! Will needs to seriously find another hobby, and adult friends! His entire life is Glee. So sad. And can he stop controlling Emma so much!? ALL THE TEARS at Burt and Kurt.
- Here for Rachel/Santana friendship. Darren Criss looked hot, and the only thing I got from teen Jesus and Sam talking was Chord’s arms.
Thoughts on the latest ‘Smash’
- How long are they going to continue with Rebecca being an insufferable character? We get it! She has new ideas constantly, and gives her input on everything, can they try something different?
- I actually found the Karen & Rebecca friendship interesting, and Karen being a secret lesbian would make her character 100% less bland.
- It was nice to see Dev finally perform, but seriously what crack was Karen on to imagine that Bollywood number!?
- I’ve always been secretly rooting for Ivy, but if they want to make me hate her, then sure pair her with Ellis.
- Eileen finally got some, get it gurl!
- Leo unfortunately came home, that’s all I got from that final scene.

Discussion in 'Conference Realignment Board' started by nelsonmuntz, May 23, 2012.
If we are to accept the OP's premise, then this is the answer plus USF, Navy, ND.
Just to nitpick here, but nobody killed themselves to throw money at Houston, SMU and UCF when they were playing UAB, UTEP, Marshall and others. I'm assuming the big reason they joined this franken-conference in the first place is that they believed they would get more when playing UConn, Rutgers, Cincinnati, Louisville, etc. Same with Boise State.
In a similar vein, nobody was throwing money at TCU in the Mountain West but it sure seems like a lot of people are throwing money at them now as a part of the B12. Obviously it isn't quite the same differential with us as it is with them but the same premise applies.
And it has the added benefit of sticking the BB onlies with this odd conglomeration of schools.
Kinda a crappy thing to do the incoming schools though. (Not that I wouldn't jump at the chance to be in a stable, sensible conference.)
I don't disagree with your statement but I'll add a second part to it. If I learned 2 things the second would be that live sports are the future of television advertising and people are willing to throw incredible amounts of money at them.
Oops. I saw the title to the thread and thought someone was looking ahead to another BCS bowl game or NCAA hoops tournament.
The current ACC deal is for $155MM per year, or $13MM per team per year. Try "the google". ESPN recently announced that the contract was adjusted to $17MM per school per year, but I would be shocked if that deal was signed given the ACC's problems.
I think every one of your conclusions is almost 100% wrong. Texas A&M and Missouri are not in the SEC for football history and tradition. John Calipari will have more Final Fours vacated in the next 3 years than Texas A&M and Missouri have in combined BCS and Final Four appearances in their history.
With the exception of a few years under McPherson and early in Pasqualoni's tenure, Syracuse has been a pillar in mediocrity for 5 decades, occasionally lapsing into bad football during that time. Colorado has sucked since McCartney stopped recruiting gang members from Watts. Utah had a couple of recent BCS appearances and a Final Four, but more importantly, it was located in one of the fastest growing states in the country.
Anyone having MD leaving for anywhere other than the SEC or Big 10 is silly. They'd owe the ACC $20 million, and they haven't got $20.
All that may be left of the ACC in the end is BCU, Duke, Wake and Syracuse.
Virginia, Maryland, UNC and... ND to the Big10.
NC St and VT to the SEC.
Clemson, Miami, G Tech, FSU, Pitt and BYU to the B12.
BE would have to reconsider what the hell to do in such a scenario. Stay with the coast to coast league. Split from the basketball schools? Kick out the new additions and invite the 3 ACC remainders?
Absolutely right; schools that were not a big media draw before will not suddenly become a viewership magnet because they are in a conference with other mostly similar schools.
OK, NBC needs sports programming but they need it less than they need losses. NBC and other networks may occasionally overpay but for the most part they will see what programming can generate as far as advertising and they bid accordingly.
The problem that more college FB programming faces is that there are already many options in the prime viewing times, say noon to 9/10PM on Saturday so NBC having a BE FB game on in that time period means that game will have to draw viewers away from the other more established conferences. Tieing a BE game to their ND game may help but people do channel surf and soon many of the ND viewers will be elsewhere either before or after the ND game.
ConnHuskBask,
I am not going to quote your whole post, but two thoughts:
1) The ACC contract that was SIGNED is for an average of $155/year for 10 years, or $13MM/school/year. ESPN announced that they had upped it to $17MM/school/year with the addition of Syracuse and Pitt, after the ACC agreed to throw a lot of new content into the deal. ESPN is under no obligation to renegotiate anything. There is an ASSUMPTION by some, that ESPN has factored in membership changes into the ACC deal, which is why it came in so light relative to the schools involved.
2) The championships you speak of with Pitt and Syracuse were decades ago. TCU and Utah have some recent success, as does WVU. The Texas A&M national title in football was during the war buildup prior to World War II. I had to look it up because I didn't realize they had ever won anything. You are right, that title is why the SEC took them. Missouri has been historically terrible at football, and they have the most NCAA Tournament appearances without a Final Four. Good work.
A little off-topic but just heard Ed Cunningham over at College Football Live calling for "cooler heads" to prevail to stop the ACC defections and saying that ND and Texas will always be more valuable commodities than the others so if your making less money you should "get over it". Don't know what that has to do with anything but boy did he sound desperate. "The idea that the ACC is dead is ridiculous to me."
After more thought, if the scenario does play out, I'm now inclined to let BCU rot in hades and pay for their crimes and bring UMass into the conference.
Initially, I was hung up on old Big East stuff BCU had done for the conference < 2003 as well as a new Prez and AD to work with . However, thoses days are long gone and BCU is damaged goods and the only positive in taking them back at this juncture would be that we took them back from the acc, which may not be saying a lot it's blown to smithereens as I hope it is. If this conference is going to succeed it must focus on moving forward than going backwards. And bringing BCU back is going backwards. Let them stew in what they did.
The BIG EAST conference without proper representation from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is a conference with a lost identity. UMass, because it's New England and because it's foaming at the mouth to be included on the college athletic map is a better addition than memphis, ucf, smu, houston sdsu and bringing back BCU will ever be. All it needs is the same venue with new leadership that UConn, RU, Cuse and alike have had to elevated their profiles; named the Big East Conference
Bringing the Flagship university of Massachusetts into the conference will undoubtedly elevate high school football in the state and is a better match up for the conference and UConn. High school players will aspire to play in the Big East. Currently, UConn is the only regional Big East option. Now with UMass as an option, it raises the competition bar for talent and forces UConn to step its game up.
In the south where college football has replaced cotton as king, high school championships are played in pro stadiums. Playing games in pro stadiums is big time and a big difference in the minds of kids. For UMass to play its 6-7 home games on the same field as the Patriotss is a big deal.
Perception wise UMass may not have the cache of other programs. But given a Big East invite, the outcomes may be as strong.
Huge upside.
It's a mathetmatical sleight of hand. The word backloaded was used over and over (like the PAc-12 it's a 6% yearly escalator contract) . By my calcs that extra $4 million a year broke down half and half like so. $30 million of that $60 million is in the back end years that pay approx $22 mil, $23 mil and $24 mil each year. That's $30 million higher than a simple $13 mil average in those 3 years. The rest, $2 mil a year, is new money based on rights concessions.
Separate names with a comma.

A round of plain stockinette should not take a full week, but this one did. Hey, I've been busy. I had company, I got a new job, "South Park" was on, the sun was in my eyes, Dolores and Victorine are sewing costumes in the living room and Harry choked on a bugle bead, there are nine hundred unread e-mails in my box...you know, the usual.
As I prepare to begin the edging, it seems appropriate to pause and commit to electronic immortality the lessons I have learned while working the center square and borders.
- Knitting swatches is vital to the success of a lace project.
- Knitting swatches is a waste of time, because swatches fucking lie.
- Do not knit from the center of a center-pull ball of laceweight. It will snarl beyond rescue, and you will attempt to kill the next person you see.
- You can never use too many stitch markers.
- Keep your work-in-progress away from colored liquids, Velcro, curious toddlers, grabby old women, chocolate, spring rain, airport security, zippers, smokers, and the rear deltoid machine at the gym.
- Ted was right. Don't count rows, count pattern repeats. If you count rows, you will stop knitting entirely and stare out the window at all the people walking by who are not knitting lace, and try to imagine a time when you, too, will not be knitting lace, and decide this time will never come, and consider stabbing yourself with both ends of your Addi Turbo.
- The road to Hell is paved with nupps.
- At some point, you will be tempted to just bind off and call it a doily.
- If you set about counting a round of 840 stitches without first clearing the room of friends and family, go ahead and call the ambulance first. It will save time later on.
- A large lace project will teach you that you are much more of an idiot, and far more clever, than you ever suspected.

Lace knitting ending and a new job?
Lace knitting ending and a new job!
Type on this entry should be in red! :)
laceweight + center pull ball = ax murder...
(Details on the new job would be lovely, too.)
Congratulations on completing the center of the shawl, starting a new job, and everything else that's good in your life.
And thanks for the tips. I've yet to undertake lace knitting, but I sure feel more prepared for it now!
Saddly, I've already learned number three the hard way. I fear that project may never be finished.
And do you really think you can casually drop a reference to a new job and not get pestered for all the details?
I don't remember reading about a four-poster bed, let alone a new job ...
WTF, a new job? I knew you were a tease, my boy, but that is just cruel.
Tell, tell tell!!!
(Congratulations on the lace. Now I'm scared to start some, but that's probably just as well).
Yay for you 'Frank' ( i see your visitor called you that..in my mind you are Franklin still :P )
You must feel like you've climbed a lace mountain!
You like opera? have you seen this utube?
It's incredible
As always, i love how your writing is true.
I am sooo glad the lace shawl I'm knitting is really a rectangular stole. There may be more rows, but at least none of them is 900 stitches long!
I, too, am dying to hear about the new job!!
I can't think of anyone more deserving of a new job, with the possible exception of Dubya. Congrats. (Oh, wait, it's all of us who deserve a new job for Dubya.)
"Woo hoo--congratulations!" says she who has never managed to finish a lace project that wasn't a dishcloth.
I swear, I shall never, ever, ever knit lace around curious toddlers or grabby old women. Which latter may be difficult, as I'm well on my way to becoming a grabby old woman. Congrats on ending the center! Is this anything like contemplating a mandala???
And yowsa, poor David; but it sounds like you took good care of him once you got hold of him. [g]
You got a new job?!?? GIVE! *kof* Please? ;)
I assume Dolores broke the old bed (accounting for the new one) and admire your tact in not putting forth the details.
A new job? Tease!!! You know we need to know a at least a little about that.
I seriously didn't know about center pull ball and laceweight, although I doubt that's the problem I have knitting with a cobweb.
Congrats on all the accomplishments and on foiling murder by Addi.
Were the grabby old woman hanging around the rear-deltoid machine at the gym? If so, I'd like to introduce them to some gawking old geezers who hang out at my gym. I swear I'm going to put googly eys on my workout shirts.
Woohoo! New job! Congrats.
Well, I have remembered the cryptic remark about the meeting with the bosses and how you never followed up on it. It has been nagging at me since and I knew at some point you'd make a reference that would clarify the situation. You have. I want to hear all about it.
I have learned some of your points from my daughter, Jen, because I'm too wussy to start a lace project.
Congratulations on your new situation and the new "company" and your entire life. I look forward to meeting you at SM (that's Stitches Midwest, thanks)
Margaret from Tex
What new job?
New job? Thought you'd just sneak that one past us, huh? Like we wouldn't notice?
Congrats on the lace and on the job! I just ordered yarn for two Glencora-like projects today.
What's that? Don't pull from the center of a pull ball? Gee, wish I had said that.
Hey, wait, I did!
How wonderful that you knitted one shawl. It will be a great family heirloom when passed to the next niece or nephew.
NEW JOB?! Where are the details?
We'd love to see the completed shawl--I'm sure it's going to be breathtakingly gorgeous.
Congratulations on completing a bunch of life stages!
--Judy
Oh nice. New job, visitor, near-death-experience-with-a-bugle-bead and you leave us hanging? Thanks.
I'm in the midst of my first real lace experience and would only add that if you're knitting with cobweb-weight yarn, put on glasses whether you wear them or not. You'll need them by the time the project is over (if not by the end of the 3rd row).
Congrats on the lace!
Yonkele! Congrats on the new job! I hope it brings you closer to nirvana.
I'm afraid to ask -- is it in Chicago?
I shall cry.
even with out the pictures, i am SO proud of you...plus i know the pictures are comming soon to a blog near you
marie in florida
OOOO -- so anxious I am to see your gorgeeous lace (before you send it off and with then with baby!) A new job! How exciting!!!
Congratulations! Both on the shawl and the new job! And best of luck with the borders and the new employment.
New job? Congrats!
#3 is painfully true. Not so long ago I threw a skein and project still on needles across the room and swore like a sailor to my husband ("Throw the damn stuff out, it's not worth it!!") Bless him, he sat for the rest of the evening picking out the knots and rewound the ball and told me I wasn't to touch it until my demeanor was a little nicer (the yarn is still in its baggie untouched).
I agree with you on the nupps too. Shoot, I agree with you on all the points.
A new job? Is it promising?
And that bit about no such thing as too many markers also saves you from the one involving counting 840 stitches.
Do not knit from the center of a center-pull ball of laceweight. It will snarl beyond rescue, and you will attempt to kill the next person you see.
This was the very first lesson I learned about lace knitting. :-( Well, right after learning that I couldn't be relied on to count to five consistently....
Sherri
So I can forgive you for not wishing me a happy birthday then, if you done went out and got a new job that isn't soul-sucking and horrible. I'm thrilled for you.
Clever idiots are the best kind. Idiotic clever people, however...
:-)
You did NOT count the rows. Please tell me you did not count the rows. Ouch.
So, when are you starting your next lace project?!
Thanks for the tip about not pulling from the center of the ball with lace-weight yarn...I'm about to start my first lace item (a simple tunic), and I would have done that automatically...
Holla that to the nupps comment. Gee wiz, I mean, they look fantastic, but man are they tiresome.
I bet there's some kind of lace-related koan.
India
Knitting swatches don't lie. They just don't behave the way you think they should. But that's why you work them.
I'm sure there's some huge spiritual lesson in that, somewhere.
New job? Spill it, dude.
I've never understood the whole center pull concept. I knit from the outside so it doesn't collapse on itself halfway-through. I mean, really, what's supposed to support a half-knitted ball of yarn if you've pulled the yarn from the center? You're just asking for a snarl. Knit from the outside, and the ball just gets smaller but doesn't collapse. (I knit for years before I even realized that other people knit from the center.)
LOL!!! Loved the list. Only you could make the pain feel so good! ;-)
Sneak. The new job thing totally slipped past me.
What? The lace is complete and there's no pictures...what's up??
Thanks for the link to nupps, btw, they look like something suitable to focus my OCD on...
Okay, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who picked up on the new job thing. I kept looking at recent posts thinking, "Did I miss something?" Evidentally, I wasn't the only one! Spill, baby!
And while you are at it, I'm job searching too (first big one after the SAHM years), so send some good job vibes this way! :-)
You certainly made me laugh! Every single one of them is true as can be! ask me how I know!
Wow congrats on new job, can't wait to hear more. And this whole list made me laugh. Fair warning for my inevitable eventual descent into lace. RE: counting stitches -- I read the section from the Yarn Harlot's book on not being interrupted when counting stitches and now my husband always says "The dryer's on fire!" when he hears me counting.
Also good to know not to pull lace yarn from the center. For the person who asked why you would ever pull from the center -- for non-lace, where you want the yarn to be fully relaxed, pulling the yarn from the center helps the yarn to further relax as it squooshes into the center. Also it doesn't roll around when you pull more out. Works great for sock yarn.
Tea - keep your lace away from your tea, particularly if you take sugar in it!
My lace has survived sugared tea (only just), velcro, university, camping, grass seeds from camping, my cat and grabby toddlers, teenages and old people, and a centrepull ball.
It's still only halfway there
Um, yeah, new job. Details, please.
Congrats on the new job - and what it is about NYC to Chicago or Chicago to NYC that seems to lure all the air travel gremlins out to play hell with our plans? I mean, in theory it's a painless 2 hr. flight, but it almost never seems to go that way...
For your next lace project, try the new Addi Lace needles -- much pointier, sharper, and more dangerous.
Well done Franklin, I knew you had it in you:)
And what new job? Enquiring minds need to know
Congratulations and bravo on the advice. Please say the new job has something to do with a book.
NEW JOB!! NEW JOB??!! I hope this brings as much mental relief as I suspect it will. And I hope it is a rewarding persuit!
And what a milestone — finishing a lace shawl. Bravo!
Amen to #3! I have often questioned the wisdom of always working from a center pull. Can't stand the resulting yarn barf and expletives.
I love #2 and #10 too. :) The muggles just don't understand our sense of pride and accomplishment in *finishing* a challenging project.
New job! Details, Franklin, details!
Please say it's in Chicago. I'll be terribly disappointed to find out that I'm moving to Chicago but I won't get to meet you.
Linda
Dude! You got a new job? I hope it's a zillion times better. Now dish! (See, the news pulled me out of lurkdom.)
#7... so true! After the swallowtail shawl, I'm looking to trade my lily-of-the-valley pattern for ANYTHING!!!
Great list and HURRAY on the job!!!
I disagree completely with #4, but the rest of the list had me in stitches (no pun intended). Congratulations on the shawl milestone!
P.S. Looking forward to reading the scoop on your new job.
As I begin my 1st lace project I appreciate your honest lessons learned!
Although I think I already knew the truth about swatches, the bastards.
Can't wait to see a pic of your shawl.
OK - regarding the new job, think the 5 Ws: who what where when why?
ALL o' us inkwiring minds need to know. You realize too, do you not, we're perched white-knuckled at our keyboards waiting to see pictures of the lace? It'll inspire some of us to try knitting lace - and the rest to return to the comfort of our warshrags...
Franklin, you're a really smart man and so I think I'll take your expertise to heart and save risking myself to the lace grief.
The rear deltoid machine at the gym? I shudder...
New job: all the gory details, please.
Great list! You are a very wise person -- like one of those yogis sitting on a mountaintop, but with lace. :)
Ahem. A new job?
Have I mentioned how much I love reading your blog? I may have, but in the event I have not, let me just say, I love reading your blog. I love it when you leave your posts up for a day or two. I love to come back and re-read them. "Just bind off and call it a doily" was the total crack-up line for me this time. But it was all the fun leading up to it, and following, that I also truly enjoy. Thanks, thanks, thanks for another wonderful read. MaryB
I thought I was the only one with the nupp issue!
I have one to add to your list: keep you knitting away from large breed puppies. At 13 weeks they are tall enough to reach your lap without leaving the floor.
Which would be why I have gotten exactly 4 rows of the mohair lace done in the last month.
Sigh.
Thanks for the list of lessons learned - really helpful as I'm in the middle of my first shawl project.
So does the new job have anything to do with Stitches Midwest? Not that we're curious or anything. But it would be wonderful if it was fiber related. I'm glad you're free of the JFH.
Yep. Pattern repeats, not rows. Especially when you're working on 500 plus stitches.
Whoa, whoa! Back up the horse! New JOB? Spill.
Oh, Franklin. Raising my needles to you in solidarity...got some lace going on over here, chock full o'nupps. (And hey, where did you sneak the nupps in, anyway? I don't remember them being part of your original plan...)
Knit on, brother.
Yessir - I totally lost it on "The road to hell is paved with nupps"
I want that put on my headstone. Nupps are only on every third entrelac rectangle of the(otherwise quite lovely) Forest Path Stole. I'd cringe as I started each and every one of those rectangles. I guess I finally learned enough to LOOSELY add those stitches on the prior row, but I still did an ecstatic jig when the final nupp was done.
Good luck on the edging.
I have not yet tried a large lace knitting project, but reading your entries is both petrifying and educational. Today I learned about nupps! (thank you for providing the click through - these tiny things mean so much to me!) congrats on the new job!!!
you have too many comments for me to see if someone has already suggested the addi lace turbos for your lace knitting. It makes the nupp-ing SO MUCH MORE pleasant. I hated the nupps. i was cursing Nancy Bush for making such beautiful Estonian lace patterns that I wanted to re-create but was getting hand cramps from dealing with all those effing nupps. Seriously. They make nupps almost enjoyable.
Your lace knitting rules are exactly correct, though I am sure the list itself is a work in progress. Thanks very much for your blog; it is a pleasure to read.
I think I would have gone crazy knitting all that lace.
Absolutely true--but so well said. That comment alone should get you not just a job, but an advance for your next (first?) book.
Congratulations- it must feel soooo good to be done! And it will feel even better to see it used :)
You are a wise man. Nupps are a tool of satan.
I laughed so hard at your list. Thanks for the warning, because I am about to unleash the monster under the bed...that is, the laceweight stash. Mother help us.
"Bind off and call it a doily" just cracked me up!
I always have to stock up on stichmarkers when I knit lace, different colors and I need a chart just to remember what they are there to remind me of.
Pretty effective piece of writing, thanks for the post.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Great Lakes freighters carried less cargo in 2012 compared to 2011.
That's according to the annual report released Friday by Ohio-based Lake Carriers' Association.
U.S.-flag ships working on the Great Lakes carried 89.5 million tons of the dry-bulk cargo last year, which is down 4.6 percent from 2011. The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports ( ) it's also down 1.5 percent from the five-year average of 90.8 million tons.
Iron ore shipments dropped 4.3 percent from 2011 but the total was above the five-year average of 42 million tons.
Coal shipments fell to 17.6 million tons last year, below the five-year average of 22.5 million tons.
The decline has been partly attributed to the phasing out of Canadian coal-fired electrical plants.
Cement and limestone shipments were slightly ahead of the five-year average.

This year marks the 35th Anniversary of the legendary 'Tokyo Tapes'. Recorded on 24 & 27th April 1978, released in late 1978 in Europe. Ever since it has become a true landmark of live Heavy Metal albums. Considered by many as THE greatest live metal album of all times.
For ages there's been rumours about Pro-shot footage on Herman Rarebell vaults.
It was released back in the day on 2 LP, and in Japan it was specially packaged with an amazing insert that can be viewed here:
Also, this year marks the 30th Anniversary of the US Festival 1983. On 29th May Scorpions stole the show and became legends in the USA.
I'd love the band to open their vaults at last !!! it would be GREAT to have those footages at last, and also the missing songs of Tokyo Tapes like 'Catch Your Train', 'Hell cat', that jam, etc. A remix (NOT BRICKWALLED and OVER EQ'D PLEASE) would be wonderful.
Please Scorpions, do something with 'Tokyo Tapes 35th anniversary' and 'US Festival 1983, 30th anniversary' this year !!!!

Allie's not big into leisurely jaunts. All too often, when I take her for a walk, she gets a funny (evil?) glint in her eye and proceeds to grab her leash with her mouth. Occasionally, she simply holds it as we walk along together. More often, though, she pulls in the direction opposite the way we're traveling in an effort to start a game of sidewalk tug-of-war.
Because I consider a tranquil walk with one's dog to be one of life's greatest joys, Allie's efforts to pump up the volume during our walks used to really bug me. I'd get impatient, I'd get angry, I'd try to get her to let go of the leash by giving her the "drop it" cue (which she would ignore) -- all of which seemed to spur her into holding onto the leash, shaking it and otherwise working harder to get me to play with her.
The funny thing is, for the longest time I didn't realize her desire to play was what was prompting her leash-grabbing. She wasn't trying to be obnoxious. She wasn't trying to be difficult. She simply wanted me to play her favorite game with her, and was suggesting that we do so in the only way she knew how. Unfortunately, I was too busy being annoyed with her to listen, much less respond appropriately.
How often do our dogs try to tell us something, only to find that we don't understand what they're trying to communicate--or worse, that we don't even try to understand? How often, conversely, do we shove own agendas down their throats without even realizing that we're doing so? How often do we miss opportunities to really connect with our dogs because we're too busy doing something else? How often do we really pay attention? How often are our relationships with our dogs more like one-way streets in which we set the agenda? How often do we give them a chance to do so?
These days, when Allie plays the leash-grabbing game, I respond very differently from the way I used to. If I'm not in the mood to play, I just keep the leash slack, and refrain from looking at her. When I do that, she understands pretty quickly that tug is not going to happen right now, drops the leash, and we continue on our way. Other times, though, I'll use my special Allie voice (sort of like baby-talk, but not really) and ask her, "Allie, are you feeling evil? Are you The Evil One?" and let her pull the leash a little bit. Sometimes we both stand still while she tugs; other times we continue walking while we play.
In any case, there's no more negativity or impatience from me when Allie asks to play sidewalk tug. That said, I'm glad we've got a durable leather leash.

Love this post. I have to be careful about such requests turning into non-stop attention seeking behaviors, but I do try to say "Yes" to many of Lilly's requests because she so often says "Yes" to mine.
P.S.
Remember clueless man who tried to train his dogs at my dogs' expense? Saw him again today. Managed to get the dogs inside w/o too much fuss, but then I watched him White Knuckle it, one dog in each hand, on their walk. And, I thought ... that doesn't look like fun for either of them.
Yuck. Poop puppies!
It must be frustrating for dogs to try to communicate with humans and have their messages ignored.
I resolve to do better.
Me, too, Jan. I sometimes think that if our dogs could speak English, they'd give us quite a lecture about our lack of communications skills.
And Roxanne, I meant to say "poor" puppies, not "poop" puppies :)
Bailey used to grab the leash also. I wonder if it's a Golden thing?
I don't think she was trying to initiate play, though. My daughter pointed out once she always did it halfway during our circular walk. She did this when we lived in Albuquerque, and then repeated it here. I assumed it was her way of saying, "I know the way from here, let me show you."
Sometimes I'd just let go and lay the leash on her back, and off she'd prance. It gave passersby a laugh.
Maybe it is a Golden thing, Kathy. I'm glad you could let Bailey run on ahead; in our NoVA suburban neighborhood, I wouldn't dare. When we go to a nearby park, though, I let her run ahead on the path -- and we practice our recalls :)
My Labs also do this, usually towards the end of our walks. The oldest will take hold of the leash of the next oldest, and so on. Now that we're down to two dogs, there's not a train of Labs heading to the door.
Gracie also grabs her leash when we go to the vet, as if to say, "Yes, I know the way in, and I know the way out."
Well, maybe it's just a very short train of Labs, Linda ;-)

Hubris and Humility: Christian Perplexity at the Pluralism of Faith
by S Parvez Manzoor
Dead are theories of racial superiority; dying are notions of cultural exclusivism, but alive and well are claims of religious uniqueness. What is superstition to biology and taboo to anthropology is not anathema to the church. The scientist possesses no value-judgment, the academic shuns it but the man of faith lives for his values. To his opponents, he is a norm unto himself, an incarnation of his own supreme value, hubris. Self-worship not self-denial, they charge, is the hallmark of religious faith.
Submission to the call of a higher authority, however, is the essence of faith. No religious consciousness is worthy of its name if it does not humble itself before the Other. In the realm of faith, the Other commands and the self obeys; Other is the Lord and self is the servant. Humility, then, lies at the heart of religion and gives sustenance to the life of faith. Hence, if faith is its own mistress, it also rides an unruly and recalcitrant conscience.
Perhaps no other religious tradition is as plagued by the paradox of humility and hubris as the church of Rome which is (was) both imperial and catholic. And no other contemporary thinker testifies to the resources and constraints of the Catholic intellect and conscience as the Swiss theologian and clergymen, Hans Küng. For, despite his banishment (In 1979, over a row on the question of infallibility, Rome withdrew its license (missio canonica) and denied Küng the right to teach as a Catholic theologian), Hans Küng has pursued without interruption his academic career at the university of Thbingen. He has also continued to behave as ‘a priest of the Ecclesia catholica’ and ‘teach the Christian truth in Catholic breadth and depth’. Nor does Küng have, even after a lapse of 15 years, any compunctions about describing his life’s mission as ‘the teaching of the Catholic doctrine as a Catholic priest.’
A man of immense erudition, energy and humanity, Hans Küng, more than any other German-speaking theologian, has been instrumental in shaping the English-speaking world’s perceptions of the Catholic faith. In fact, Küng’s theological and moral reflections extend far beyond his ecclesiastical concerns. Despite his estrangement from the Church, he has taken upon himself the role of the intellectual spokesman of Catholic Christianity and conducted on this basis a series of very intense and earnest dialogues with all the major challengers to the Catholic doctrine, viz. philosophy, science, ethics, Judaism and other non-Christian faiths. His creativity, vigour and endurance have been truly amazing. He is as prolific as he is profound and original.
The volume, Hans Küng: New Horizon for Faith and Thought, was dedicated to Küng in 1993 when he celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday. It is not a Festschrift in the customary manner, nor does it provide to the uninitiated reader an introduction to his life and thought. On the contrary, it is a very erudite and demanding book which presupposes familiarity not only with Küng’s own works but also with the debate that surrounds them. As a ‘workbook’, it probes, with rigour and profundity, the wider theological, philosophical, ethical and anthropological implications of Küng’s faith and teachings and thus provides the serious student a convenient entry point to the contemporary debate in Christianity. Despite its omission of certain articles and the abbreviation of the complete bibliography that appeared in the original German edition, the present volume does supply the English reader with a more than adequate and relevant list of Hans Küng’s writings.
The structure of the book follows Küng’s own intellectual itinerary and contains the following signposts: ‘Church; Catholicity; The Ecumenical World [the common Christian umma]; Christology and the Doctrine of God [Trinity, Incarnation etc.]; Dialogues with Judaism; World Religions; and Effects [Cross-cultural dialogue].’ The editors liken the plan of the book to ‘seven concentric circles’ where one progressively moves outward from the centre (the church) to Catholicity, to Christian unity, to dialogues with Judaism and other religions, till one reaches the outermost edge, the non-religious world. Notwithstanding the high intellectual calibre of the individual pieces, it goes without saying that much of what the volume contains is not of interest to the Muslim reader. Indeed, some of it is incomprehensible as well! By contrast, the only Muslim contribution, by Abdoljavad Falaturi, is relatively slim and meagre in form (9 pages) but incommensurably richer in substance and meaning.
Besides being a critical survey of the contemporary religious and theological debate in which Hans Küng’s thought serves as the pivot, the book has another, more practical, aim: ‘the rehabilitation of Hans Küng as a Catholic theologian’! It is in this regard that such human sentiments, nay passions, are unabashedly made public as: “Küng’s theology has drawn and still draws on the seed-bed of his own church, in which - much to the sorrow of some of his opponents - he has put down viable roots.” Otherwise, there are petitions to the supreme authority of the Church: “Holy Father!... We appeal to your responsibility and your conscience: make good a wrong that has been done! Do not leave the rehabilitation of Küng to history! Make your personal action a blessing for the church!”. Even to the outsider, however, the following rhetorical question, posed by Heinrich Fries, is not without significance: “Is the Catholic church so narrow that it cannot tolerate a man like Küng, or is it so rich that it can dispense with him?”
Not all the topics treated in this immensely rich and rewarding work, it has been suggested earlier, merit the Muslim reader’s close attention. Quite exceptional, then, is the solitary but sterling contribution by Abdoljavad Falaturi which reflects on the problem of ‘Christian Theology and the Western Understanding of Islam’. To start with, Falaturi’s immediate response to Hans Küng’s recent work, Christianity and World Religions (English edition: Collins, London, 1987; paperback re-issue by SCM Press, London, 1993) which claims to be a ‘dialogue with Islam’ is that ‘it is not a dialogue with Islam but with Islamic scholars’ (Exclusively Western but most notably Josef van Ess). Hans Küng, in other words, has yet to carry out his dialogue with Islam. His forthcoming book on Islam, one feels, should give an indication of whether Küng intends to encounter ‘Islam’ through the mediation of a living Muslim scholar or whether he will continue to rely on his Orientalist mentors.
Falaturi, on his part, does not deliver a critique of Küng’s book, or dwell on its individual faults. Instead, he concentrates on its ambition to act ‘as a model example of both an apt Western understanding of Islam and a well-disposed Christian theological position on it.’ Unfortunately, the basic moral prerequisites of a ‘dialogue of religions and cultures’, namely ‘the attempt to understand conversation partners as they understand themselves’ and, on a religious level, the inner preparedness ‘to concede that the love and mercy of God is also to be found among those of other faiths and is not present only among those who share one’s own beliefs’, are not always present in Western/Christian responses to Islam. Far more pervasive are cultural and emotional factors, the negative attitudes towards each other from the starting point, which render every Christian-Muslim dialogue a truly daunting experience.
Even more problematic and frustrating is the situation on the academic, particularly theological, level. For, Falaturi makes it perfectly clear that ‘in their present form and status the phenomenology of religion and comparative religion are a specifically Western achievement, and the scientific vocabulary developed to this end is not value-neutral. The necessary concepts, propositions and arguments have been derived predominantly from Christian theology and Western spiritual life or have been oriented on new forms of it.’ (His italics. One may further underscore this point by noting that one of the ‘classics’ of phenomenology of religion, Rudolf Otto’s paradigmatic The Idea of the Holy (First published in 1917; English translation published by Oxford University Press, 1923, Re-issue, Pelikan Books, 1959) appears, to the unconditioned Muslim reader at least, as an undisguised apology of the Christian doctrine. Indeed, even later phenomenolgists are not free from the Christian bias. See our review of W.C. Smith’s What is Scripture? in MWBR, XIV:4 (Summer 1994), pp 3-8.)
The main problem of the dialogue, and the logical starting-point of any phenomenological discussion, Falaturi believes, should be the realization that religious phenomena and religious experiences do not belong to easily transferable mental categories. Hence, due recognition must be given to the fact that Christianity and Islam present two different models of faith, each of which has its own significant claim. Falaturi then delineates his own phenomenological portrait of Islam as ‘the firm conviction that the revealed guidance corresponds as a light to that “orientation on God” which God has given on their way to human beings, as the only vehicles of the divine Spirit, by their justly created nature (fitra), is of decisive significance for the Islamic system of faith; here is a consistent correspondence between creation and revelation. So guidance is not something forced on human beings from outside. Rather, within the framework of divine mercy it is a necessity without which human being will not be in a position to attain the highest goal, the presence of God.’ The point, quite simply is that Guidance as God’s mercy is to Islam what divine love and salvation are to Christianity. ‘Neither of them’, he asserts further, ‘can be transferred to the other.’
According to Falaturi, these fundamental phenomenological difference entail that apart from the completely irreconcilable christologies of Islam and Christianity, even other central concepts such as scripture, faith, religion, prophecy etc. take on different meanings. Thus, while scripture in Christian theology largely looses its significance under the shadow of Jesus, in Islam, as a manifestation of God’s mercy and guidance ‘it represents the possibility of being addressed directly by God and thus of experiencing God consciously anew.’ Another point of capital importance in any Christian-Muslim dialogue is the fundamental rejection of the biblical accounts of prophecy on the part of the Qur’an which, in Falaturi’s opinion, ‘should give a historian freed from the pressures of apologetics occasion to revise the ill-considered thesis that the Qur’an is written off by the Bible.’
Consistent with the phenomenological and dialogical sensitivity is Falaturi’s observation that Islamic theology has developed no vocabulary for a scientific assessment of other religions. Regrettably, he notes further, Muslim theologians are not fully cognizant of the otherness of Christian theology, ‘which to the present has spread its wings into all the humanities.’ Nor do they have any inkling of its spiritual power, its scope and its massive involvement with the dynamics and problems of the secular world. Hence, not only with a view to a fruitful dialogue but also in its own interest, even if purely academic, Islamic theology need to enter a new scientific phase and familiarize itself with Christian theology. Few thinking Muslims will, of course, dispute this conclusion.
Even if Hans Küng’s pioneering work Christianity and the World Religions, concludes Falaturi, is not a dialogue in that there is no conversation in it with the living representatives of Islam, it does have an attraction of its own: Islam - seen from outside - is presented in the categories of Western thought and there are reflections on it from the perspective of Christian theology. Thus, ‘despite all the resentment that Muslims may nurse at such an attempt, the achievement and significance of the work remains undisputed.’ The disturbing aspects of the study emanate not so much from the perception of Hans Küng the Catholic theologian as from that of Hans Küng the representative of Western Machtmensch who declares without the least compunction: ‘But let us admit that Islam continues for us primarily alien, politically and economically more threatening than Hinduism or Buddhism, and at any rate a phenomenon which we find it difficult to understand.’ To this Falaturi gives the following, thoughtful yet unambiguous, retort:
‘How can a Hindu, a Buddhist, or in particular a Muslim dialogue partner carry on a serious dialogue when they know from the beginning that in the eyes of the Christian participant they are seen as “threatening” or even very threatening? For what reason is the dialogue now being carried out? To diminish the threat? Is that an aim of the dialogue? And who is threatened and for what reasons? In this way, will not any basis for a dialogue on equal footing be ruled out right from the start?’
It is obvious that in Küng’s dialogue with Islam much more than mere theological sensibility is at stake. The problem of the rapacious ethic of industrial society, and its viability in a truly universal system, also looms large in his vision. He is further distressed by the possibility that Muslim opposition to Western science and technology may create a permanent rift between North and South. That the Islamic commitment also entails active struggle against all forms of oppression and injustice causes him merely parochial worries. Thus, Falaturi is obliged to point out most emphatically that Islam as a religious system does not represent any anti-Western propensity. Rather, the thrust of its revival is directed against the pseudo-values of the permissive modern culture which Küng himself describes as ‘inappropriate both for Islam and Christianity.’ Despite everything, however, both Küng and Falaturi appear to be in agreement that the common challenge for Christian and Islamic theology lies in creating, within the matrix of ‘a new ecumenical paradigm of secularity viewed against a religious background’, a third way between ‘either’ and ‘or’.
There can be no doubt that Abdoljavad Falaturi’s intense reflection on the intellectual and spiritual context of Muslim-Christian dialogue is both sensitive and bold. He has responded to Hans Küng’s initiative at the Christian-Muslim dialogue with energy, creativity and humanity. From now on, every future effort to extend the scope of this dialogue is under obligation to take into account the full import of Falaturi’s vision.
One of the most vigorous challenges to Hans Küng’s theology, unnegotiably committed to upholding the ‘uniqueness’ of Jesus, comes from the members of ‘the pluralistic theology of religions’ group. In their opinion, Küng’s view presents an insurmountable obstacle for the Christian dialogue with other religions. The most audible, and cogent, voice in this critical chorus is that of John Hick, even if such esteemed thinkers as Wilfred Cantwell Smith also belong to the pluralist school. The challenge of the pluralistic theology is best expressed by the metaphor ‘crossing the theological Rubicon’. It should be understood, according to Paul Kittner, as: ‘To cross it means to recognize clearly, unambiguously, the possibility that other religions exercise a role in salvational history that is not only valuable and salvific but perhaps equal to that of Christianity; it is to affirm that there may be other saviours and revealers besides Jesus Christ. It is to admit that if other religions must be fulfilled in Christianity, Christianity must, just as well, find fulfilment in them.’
The Anglican John Hick is even more outspoken in his advocacy of a God-centered rather than a Christ-centered faith: ‘The Idea of the Trinity and the two natures of Christ are in fact incomprehensible to most people. In comparison, a non-traditional Christian faith can be genuinely simple and yet profound. Consider the belief that there is an ultimate Reality which is the source and ground of everything; that this Reality is benign in relation to human life; that the universal presence of this Reality is reflected (‘incarnated’) in human terms in the lives of the world’s great spiritual leaders; and that among these we have found Jesus to be our principal revelation of the Real and our principal guide for living.’ (The Metaphor of God Incarnate, p 163)
The pluralist objection is motivated by ethical considerations and emanates from a utopian vision of a world community of faith(s). From this perspective, the idea that Christianity, or even biblical faiths, have a monopoly on religious truth, proclaims the feminist theologian Rosemary Radford Ruether, ‘is an outrageous and absurd religious chauvinism.’ Other objectors, such as Gregory Baum, have argued that Küng’s stress on the centrality and uniqueness of Jesus, his ideological ‘rhetoric of exclusion’, favours a division of the world into ‘Christians’ and ‘non-Christians’ and that this language affects the way the church thinks and treats ‘outsiders.’ Indeed, it makes the church ‘vulnerable to evil’. Baum also refers to the persecution of the Jews as a classic example of this ‘rhetoric of exclusion.’ Küng has been criticized even on historical grounds in that his assertion about the uniqueness of Jesus cannot be substantiated by the exercise of the historical method.
Kenneth Brewer has summed up the whole pluralist debate in ‘The Uniqueness of Christ and the Challenge of the Pluralist Theology of Religions’ (Kuschel and Häring: pp 198-215). Indeed, he has recapitulated Küng’s basic argument and even tried to defend his exclusivist position. Neither the Küng’s argument, nor Brewer’s defence, however, are sufficiently alert to the philosophical antinomy of ‘history’ and ‘norm’, the clash between historical reflection and the determination of standards of truth and value, which was introduced in the Christian debate by Ernst Troeltsch and which since then has continued to plague Christian reason. Indeed, the Church’s main argument against Küng’s Christology, articulated by Cardinal Höffner, has been precisely this, namely that Küng’s method ‘from below’ and his emphasis upon functional categories reduced Christ’s uniqueness to that of any religious reformer! Further, Küng’s reasons for postulating the uniqueness of Jesus and his comparisons with other founders of religion are so schematic and slanted that these can only be accepted as statements of faith. By no means do they count as ‘facts of history.’ (Needless to say, Küng is outrageously perverse in the case of Islam and envisions the mission of the Prophet as ‘world conquest’ and the establishment of an ‘expansionist state’!)
The unconventional Festschrift dedicated to Hans Küng is thus a conventional example of Christian hubris, just as John Hick’s The Metaphor of God Incarnate is that of its humility. Earlier, Hick had acquired instant notoriety by presenting a collective work, The Myth of God Incarnate (SCM Press, London, 1977), which asserted that the conception of Jesus as God incarnate, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity living a human life, is mythological, and hence, cannot be accepted as literal truth. Though the book did not say anything that the biblical scholars had not already discussed in learned journals, its popular format and combative posture did help generate a lot of controversy. The present volume sums up the earlier debate and presents its argument against literalism with scholarly calm and ecumenical pathos.
The impartial Muslim reviewer may sum the main insight of ‘de-incarnationist’ theology as the, belated, realization that the Jewish expression ‘son of God’ is metaphoric, that it denotes no ontological relationship, no participation by the person so named in the divine nature. Rather, it connotes a moral state. The doctrine of incarnation, then, represents a transformation of the Jewish (monotheistic) moral metaphor into a Greek (polytheistic) metaphysical theory. Moreover, none of what the Church proclaimed of Jesus, according to Hick, would have been acceptable, indeed even comprehensible, to him. In short, Hick wants to give up some of the historical, and historicising, ‘truths’ of the Christian tradition for the recovery of the Transcendent. Lest some Muslims misconstrue Hick’s revisionist theology as a rehabilitation of the Qur’anic criticism of incarnationist Christianity, it is merely proper to point out that his excessive emphasis on religious pluralism, and his Ibn-‘Arabian language of Transcendent Reality, smacks more of existential pantheism than of the Qur’anic transcendentalism. For the Muslim reader, however, Hick’s book is particularly informative, and instructive, of the historical and ideational matrix within which primitive Christianity’s radical departure from Hebrew monotheism took place.
For the Muslim, far more challenging than Christian hubris and far more encouraging than Christian humility is the prospect of a radical ethical discourse on our common humanity. Hans Küng’s pioneering effort at the formulation of a global ethic, no matter how tentative and how problematic, deserves to be lauded and supported by the Muslim. The declaration, presented in Küng’s and Kuschel’s edited volume, A Global Ethic, was formally adopted by ‘the Parliament of World’s Religions’ in September 1993. Of course, to the votaries of political realism it appears as hopelessly utopian and naive document. And yet, though one may squabble about its legality, one may question the legitimacy of the adopting body, one may raise a thousand objections against its individual provisions, one cannot disclaim its need. The goal of a universal Gemeinschaft may be far, and it may even turn out to be a mirage, but the path leading to it has to be trodden. The discourse of Global Ethic may be taken as a humble step on that path and a conscientious movement in that direction.
The motivation for a universal ethic is quite simple. Everyone recognizes that we are already living within the world wide web of a global society (Weltgesellschaft), though as yet there are no signs of a universal community (Weltgemeinschaft). Our reality, which is increasingly shaped by world politics, world technology, world economy and world civilization cannot therefore do without a world ethic. In utopian discourse, the terminology itself causes problems: Global Ethic (not ‘ethics’ as it refers to the system or the ‘science’ of morals) represents the English counterpart to the German ‘Weltethos’ and the French ‘éthique planétaire’) and conveys the idea of universal norms of conduct in a global society. However, according to its proponents, a global ethic means neither a global ideology, nor a single global religion that transcends all existing religions, nor a syncratic amalgam of all religious traditions. Nor does a global ethic, assures Hans Küng, seek to replace the high ethics of the individual religions with an ethical minimalism. Prior to the presentation of his draft, Küng also realized that the declaration of a global ethic must neither be a duplicate of the United Nations’ ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights’, nor a casuistic moral sermon, nor a philosophical treatise, nor a religious proclamation, nor indeed a political manifesto.
In substance, the Declaration makes ‘a fundamental demand that every human being must be treated humanely’ and affirms ‘commitment to a culture of non-violence’, ‘commitment to a culture of solidarity and a just economic order’, ‘commitment to a culture of toleration and a life of truthfulness’, and ‘commitment to a culture of equal rights and partnership between men and women.’ It avoids programmes of social and political action but accepts the fundamentally political category of citizenship when it remonstrates that ‘no person should ever be considered or treated as a second-class citizen’! It certainly lives up to its promise of being concise, intelligible and inspiring. Significantly, no dissent was ever expressed concerning its desirability and need, just as its opening statement that ‘Every human being must be treated humanely’ met with universal approval. For all its shortcomings, it represents a significant declaration of the ethical intent of our age. A sober Muslim critique of its contents may come later, an active Muslim involvement has to be immediate.
Hans Küng also situates this quest for a global ethic within the social and cultural context of ‘potmodernity’ and its key themes: ‘polycentrism, war and peace, critique of civilization, the women’s movement, the ecumenical movement’ etc. His own kulturkritik thus highlights the following issues:
- Science, but not wisdom to prevent the misuse of scientific research.
- Technology, but no spiritual energy to bring the unforeseeable risks of a highly-efficient macrotechnology under control.
- Industry, but no ecology which might fight against the constantly expanding economy.
- Democracy, but no morality which could work against the massive interests of various individuals and groups in power.
To an outsider, however, much of this criticism appears gratuitous, especially so when one realizes that Hans Küng has no policies to recommend but that he is content with the annunciation of a nondescript ethic as a ‘solution’ to the above mentioned malaise! What evidence is there to suggest, however, that the world becomes a better place when men of cloak, or turban, take the helm?
It is in this spirit that the Muslim sensitivity may finally be given vent. The Muslim is not opposed to utopian schemes, nor is he averse to the formulation of any global ethic. He may endorse all these and yet be discontent. It is because his moral conscience demands more than a world ethic; it longs for world-order. For, to have an ethic is also to get involved - willy-nilly - with politics and with the questions of power and responsibility. Who has power over technology and hence bears the responsibility of letting it play havoc with our lives? Who owns the industry that destroys our habitat? Who preaches democracy but practices no morality? These are the questions which the Muslim would like to interject into the discourse of world ethic.
There is no doubt that in working for a common humanity, in dreaming about a universal Gemeinschaft, in dealing with both the hubris and humility of Christianity, the Muslim will find Hans Küng a formidable and charitable partner.

I knew this picture was going to be a scrapper. King and Slayden sitting around the campfire in Montana. They looked so stinkin’ cute in their Carhart jackets. Slayden thinks King (aka Lunchbox) is the shizznit. Slayden is a smart kid, I kinda think King is the shizznit too!
I am pretty proud of myself on this page . . . broke out the burlap to for added texture.
I am quite certain this is the best picture that King and I took in 2010.
1 comment:
I love both of the pages! The burlap really makes the first page pop. Good job.

Share This out for weddings, funerals and court appearances. We know that most of you would rather wear a Yankees jersey than be forced into a sport coat on the weekend, but hear us out on this one.
Done right, a jacket can be paired with a wide array of casual clothing, and the rest of your outfit can determine how ‘dressed-up’ or ‘dressed-down’ you are overall. It should also be comfortable. If it’s not, you’re in the wrong jacket.
Blazers are highly functional. It’s not summer yet. Instead of grabbing an outdoor jacket and then being stuck wearing it in the bar all night or being forced to carry it around and hang it on odd objects (because no one seems to have coat racks anymore) why not don a sport coat instead? It’ll keep the spring chill off your back and take you from a walk in Patterson Park to a table at Annabelle Lee in style. Plus you get half a dozen extra pockets. Who doesn’t want that?.
A jacket will open doors for you. Remember the last time you were walking up Charles Street and you really really had to pee and all you heard was “Sorry. The restroom is for customers only.” Well, a blazer might have gotten you in there. It can also result in a round on the house, airline or hotel upgrades, and certain persons keeping mum when liberties are taken. If you want to be money, you’ve got to look money.
Wearing a jacket will keep you out of trouble. Know how you’re prone to yell at people in traffic, commit random larcenies and tell Red Sox fans to go screw? Well, you remember yourself a little better in a blazer. Dressing like a man tends to encourage acting like a man. Funny how that works.
It’s a rule. Of course, we’ll all be a bit rakish from time to time, no matter how finely cut the clothes. As the outstanding blog 1001 Rules For My Unborn Son recently quoted “Dissolute behavior in a coat and tie is always more amply forgiven.” Next time you (un)knowingly make a pass at her while her husband is across the bar, make sure you’re wearing a hell of a nice jacket.
To clarify: we know the terms ‘sport coat’ and ‘blazer’ are not interchangeable, although for the purposes of this post they are. If you need further guidance Esquire’s fashion editor Nick Sullivan will sort out the issue for you. There are also a wide range of opinions online about what jackets work where and for whom.

So one of the many many cool things of being a part of the Covenant Health Biggest Winner Team is that one of our coaches is Joe Mitchell, a former NBC Biggest Loser contestant. It was really neat talking with him last night about life on the ranch, and how they really go about losing all that weight so fast. I don't think he told us anything he wouldn't mind sharing. I got two big takeaways from Joe last night. The first biggest takeaway I got was the insight that during there time on the ranch, the contestants are moving, basically, all day. Literally from the time he got up in the morning, to sometimes as late as midnight, they were either walking, running, hiking, or in the gym (when they weren't eating or in the bathroom of course). So they burn something crazy like 8000 calories per day! With a caloric intake of roughly 1500 calories for him, so you can see why they lose big amounts of weight each week. Those types of numbers really isn't realistic for most normal people with jobs and lives and such. But what it does show me is what we as humans and what are bodies are really capable of, given the right circumstances.
I really wanted to join Joe this morning at Fort Sanders for a 6:00 am spin class. Not because I like spin classes, in fact, I have only taken one and I basically hated it. It made my rear end hurt in a way that I hope to never experience again. But I know if I can do that spin class on those 3 days per week, thats 1000 extra calories that I burned. Can I get up at 5:30 am? Yes. Did I want to? No. So it goes back to the mental battle.
And I will leave this post with the other big takeaway. The Biggest Loser is on it's 14th season starting Sunday, so at this point there is a bit of an Alumni of past contestants. Most everybody loses weight while they are on the show, whether they stay on the ranch or get sent home, and see results. What I think is interesting is what happens after. 1 year later, 2 years later, 5 years later. It is a mixed bag. Some people do well and keep it off, others struggle. Joe shared the reason that most people struggle is that they view weight loss as a Starting point, and and Ending point. "Once I get to where I am going, I can relax and start living like I used to again." For those of you who have known me for some time, you know I fit into that catagory, but that is info for a whole other post altogether.
This is a journey, but a unique one in that there really isn't a destination. There are always goals, new challenges, new ways to push yourself and surprise yourself and do things that you have previously said you would not or could not ever do. I hope my struggles and successes help inspire others to find their own new and exciting challenges.

Great post, Ken! Joe is an inspiration to all of us - and you are, too!
Great post! The mental challenge is most often the hardest! Keep up the good work and surround yourself w/ people who will help hold you accountable!

Actually Aveo won. The Avalanche driver was taken by Mercy Flight (Usually indicating life-threatening injury) and the driver and passenger of Aveo taken by Mercy EMS with non-threatening injuries.
Three people injured, two needing helicopter transport, in accident on West Main Street, Batavia
Submitted by Howard Owens on November 11, 2012 - 5:37pm
Two people were taken to regional hospitals by Mercy Flight after an accident at 2:40 p.m. on West Main Street at the turn-in for Valu Plaza.
Both people, the driver of one car and his passenger, had non-life-threatening injuries. The driver was taken ECMC and the passenger to Strong Memorial Hospital.
A third person, the driver of a red Chevy Avalanche involved in the crash, was taken to Strong by Mercy EMS.
Reportedly, the driver of a blue Chevy Aveo was making a left-hand turn from the westbound lane into Valu Plaza. He allegedly pulled in front of the red Avalanche.
City and Town of Batavia fire departments responded and Sheriff's deputies are investigating the accident.

John, I think you need new glasses. The blue Aveo is FUBAR and the Avalanche might also be FUBAR, but it sure looks a whole lot better than the Aveo.
OMG, this was an accident that resulted in some serious injuries and all you two morons can do is argue over which vehicle won?
Seriously?
Ray, it's an observation. Whether it's verbalized or not, I'm pretty sure everyone evaluates many aspects of an accident when they see it. I'm pretty sure I said that I hope everyone pulls through okay.
My observation was actually for my own benefit, but I said what I was thinking so everyone could see it. I'll never drive an Aveo, that's for sure. Was I wrong for saying that or should I only comment on what's important to you? Just wondering...
We could talk about the collation between prius and aveo to liberal drivers. Maybe?
Howard, not sure where any info came from, but to set the record straight, the driver and passenger in the Aveo were both airlifted to ECMC. I was informed the driver of the Avalanche was taken to Strong via ground ambulance.
The driver and passenger in the Aveo, are in fairly good shape considering how bad the crash was.
Some broken bones, some surgury, and some rehab, and both should be allright in a couple of months.
The passenger in the Aveo was suppossed to be taken to Strong, but somehow ended up going to ECMC, despite the fact the medics were told to go to strong, as the patient has ties to that hospital, and recieves out-patient treatment at Strong.
Aveo meets Avalanche...Avalanche wins. I'm sticking with my Silverado 2500HD. Hopefully everyone pulls through okay.

I know it's 'in vogue' to call for the head of the hitting coach when things are going badly. I'm hardly the first and if things keep going like this for the Twins (6 runs in 4 games) more and more people will jump on that bandwagon. The fact of the matter is that in each of the past two season, the Twins offense has gotten off to a very slow start and sometimes a change a scenery is needed, even if the old scenery isn't necessarily the problem.
Last year, the circumstances were different, but the outcome was the same. In their first 29 games of 2011, the Twins managed only one game in which the offense scored more than 5 runs. Injuries were to blame more than anything else for the slow start in 2011, but this year the Twins entered and emerged from Spring Training with a fully capable lineup that had been playing well leading up to the beginning of the season.
Their struggles so far this year are no mystery when you look at the data. As a team they seem unable to hit a ball that doesn't hit the ground before it hits a glove. In fact, of all the balls the Twins have put in play so far this season, 67.7% of them have been groundballs which, far and away, leads the Majors. Their GB/FB ratio is 3.35/1 -- almost DOUBLE that of any other team (the next closest is the Giants at 1.87/1 GB/FB ratio). The propensity to hit groundballs has led to an understandably low BABIP (.184) which pretty much explains why the Twins have been unable to score runs. To put it a different way - the Twins have scored 6 runs in 4 games and 3 of those runs have come as a result of HRs hit by Josh Willingham. If not for that, the Twins would have been shutout twice in the first 4 games. [all stats courtesy of fangraphs.com]
Joe Vavra's had a good run. He was hired following the 2005 season and in 2006, the Twins scored over 800 runs and won 96 games. After a down year in 2007, the Twins again reached the 800+ runs mark in both 2008 and 2009 and almost reached that mark in 2010 scoring 781 runs. Last year, well, we all know what happened last year - the team only scored 619 runs on it's way to one of the worst years in franchise history.
I'm only half-heartedly calling for a change. I know it's only 4 games and I also know that there are 158 games left this season. The Twins offense could (and probably will) turn it around at any point. I'm saying that if this offensive futility continues, then there needs to be some changes made -- and in this case I think it should start with the hitting coach.

Entourage fans rejoice! On Wednesday night’s Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Jeremy Piven (Ari Gold) confirmed that there is going to be an Entourage movie.
Piven told Fallon, “They’ve commissioned the movie… It should happen” I have only one thing to say – Boom!
Don’t believe me, here it is from the man himself:
Jeremy Piven talks “Entourage” movie on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon”
There’s no further information about filming dates, release date or storylines, but from the Entourage series finale we know that Ari Gold has been offered a job of a lifetime. Will he risk his marriage and take it? I think we all know the answer to that one! Bring it on
That’s Entertainment!

Before I met Eric, I wasn’t much of a gin fan. Like most booze-related stories, this was due to a night of excessive consumption back in my college days. There was plenty of mixing, I’m sure… but the big drink from that night was gin. And it didn’t end well. For a while, I couldn’t even stand the smell of it. The scent of juniper berry gave me an instant hangover.
When Eric and I got together, I quickly learned that I needed to get over my aversion to it. In the summer, his family drinks gin and tonics nightly as they watch the sunset over the lake at the Cape house. So, I caved. It didn’t take long for me to fall in love all over again.
I have had the opportunity to sample quite a few different gins over these last few years, both locally produced and from all over the world. There are a number that I am fond of, but the gin that I am head over heels for is Watershed Gin in Columbus Ohio. As stated in the description on their website, juniper notes are layered with hints of citrus and this creates one of the most delicate gins I have ever tasted. If you are at all a gin fan, make friends with someone in Ohio and have them ship you a bottle.
Now that I’ve hyped up this fabulous spirit, let me tell you about this cocktail here, which was created by the folks at The Inn At Honey Run (located in Holmes County), which is where I stayed with a few other food bloggers when we toured Ohio’s Amish Country earlier this year. While the inn originally prepared The Tarragon with Watershed Vodka, I requested Watershed Gin and, I have to say, I think I liked it better this way.
These are irresistibly delicious and after your first one, I can promise you’ll be refilling your cocktail shaker. The tarragon simple syrup adds an additional component that brings the flavors in the gin together.
If you can’t get a bottle of Watershed Gin or Vodka, the simple syrup would be great with any other vodka or gin (heck, it even goes well with tequila). Happy weekend everyone! Cheers!
The Tarragon Cocktail
created at The Inn at Honey Run
Ingredients
1/2 oz. Simple Syrup (infused with fresh tarragon… see directions below for the simple syrup)
2 oz. Watershed Vodka or Gin
1 oz. Fresh Squeezed Lime Juice
Directions
Pour ingredients into cocktail shaker filled with ice.
Strain into martini glass.
Garnish with thin lime slice.
For an added touch, also garnish with candied tarragon leaves.
Tarragon Simple Syrup
Ingredients
1 cup water
1 cup granulated sugar
3 tablespoons tarragon leaves, chopped
Directions
Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small sauce pan. Add the tarragon leaves. Simmer until the sugar has dissolved. Take off heat and let the mixture sit for an additional 10 minutes before straining. Strain the tarragon leaves out of the simple syrup. Let the syrup cool completely before using.
Can be stored in a jar in the refrigerator for up to a month.

let nextNumber n = if n%2L = 0L then n/2L else 3L*n+1L let findSequenceLength n = let mutable count = 1L let mutable current = n while current > 1L do current <- nextNumber current count <- count + 1L count let longestSeq = [1L..999999L] |> Seq.maxBy findSequenceLength
Having played around with several other approaches, I finally settled down on this solution though I had to use mutable variables in a while loop which is somewhat dissatisfying but it performs quite a bit better than the more functional approach.
As you probably know already, in F# everything is immutable by default and to make a mutable variable you have to mark the variable with the mutable keyword. To assign a value to a mutable variable you need to use the <- operator.
Anyways, the above code is fairly simple, with the findSequenceLength function doing the bulk of the work and returns the number of elements in a sequence using a while loop. It can be equally be written using a more functional (but slower) approach but building the sequence with Seq.unfold and counting the length of the sequence
// the sequence returned by Seq.unfold does not include 1, so for completeness sake, add 1 to the length let findSequenceLength n = Seq.length(Seq.unfold (fun x -> if x = 1L then None else Some(x, nextNumber x)) n) + 1
let p14 =
let collatz n =
let rec loop n i =
match n with
|n when n = 1I -> i
|n when n%2I = 0I -> loop (n/2I) (i+1I)
|n -> loop (3I*n+1I) (i+1I)
loop n 1I
[1I..1000000I]|> Seq.maxBy collatz
i think max.By is a great funciton

Thanks for all of the efforts
Thanks for all of the efforts on this website. My mother really likes going through investigation and it's really simple to grasp why. Most of us hear all about the dynamic method you make sensible solutions via your website and in addition boost contribution from the others on this subject matter plus our favorite child is actually learning a lot of things. Take pleasure in the rest of the new year. Your performing a wonderful job.
"Your"?
Your performing a wonderful job.
Most entertaining! But, sadly, you're illiterate. And your ignorance are only to be succeeded and exceded by the ignorance of your " favorite child " .
Please keep it up!
But for you and yours, to paraphrase Twain, the rest of us could not succeed! !
God bless you.
Why send these guys home?
They are only going to get back on the battlefield and plan more attacks against the west. This is insane. At least before you send them back, debug them with some flea medication so they do not spread diseases to the people of Qatar. Sending these terrorists back is a huge mistake.
They will return to the battle field and they will do battle again. It just does not make any sense. We need to take all their belongings and sell them in storage auctions to pay back all the room and board we gave them during their luxurious stay at camp gitmo. I am sure they all weigh about 50lbs more than when they arrived there. Sending them home is plain idiotic.
Why send these guys home?
Answer: They are either relatted to President Obama or have the
same goals in common of destroying the United States.
or maybe the Obama administration are all on drugs.
what the dictator is thinking...
I would inject them with some fatal disease thius assuring their participation in future killing of US soldiers null...
The whole idea of negotiating with Taliban and releasing dangerous criminals that took so much effort, money and human sucrifice to capture isn;t just insane I consider it treasonous....
OMG
Barak Hussein Bin Laden is doing the same thing his namesake (Hussein)did. That is-in his last days, knowing his regime was crumbling, he released all the criminals and looney bins from their prisons.
Stay tuned for more, especially with this justice dept.
Why are they sending these guys home.
Maybe he's just trying to make room for him and all his friends and family when they are tried, convicted and imprisoned for High T reason.
Dems running from the "Good War".
After telling us that we needed to be concentrating on the "good war" in afghanistan- instead of Iraq-. Iooks like the administration can't wait to capitulate to the Taliban
These terrorists won't spend the night in Qatar. They'll be off to Pakistan on the next doonda boat.
We're having Rogan Josh for dinner!
America's Neville Chamberlain
Obama is America's Neville Chamberlain and the military's bed wetter-in-chief.
Could not have said better. He is a muslin mole, set to destroy the USA. The people gave him a chance, let's not give him four more years to complete his mission.
I live and work for the last 15 years outside of the US because I see the end coming.
It hurts.
there is more suprises coming...
Looks like Obama may well be finally revealing Who he really is.....the release of those killers in just a beginning...
Weakening our country, muslimatization of our country, disappering personal freedoms, making the decisions without congression approval or in spite of it - all are very dangerous signs....especially since the media is doing all in it's power to cover up , to lie , to attack the critics and opponents ...race blame game had been taken to unbelievable proportions....
This just shows how naive
This just shows how naive this administration is. The Taliban is not to be trusted. War is a dirty game, yet Obama believes we can 'talk' them into living in peace and respect of other views. The Taliban will lie through their rotted teeth to get free from GITMO. We cuddled them and gave into their every demand. We have sacrificed our best and bravest, then called them criminals for pissing on dead enemy bodys.
Wake up America!!!! We are not living in a fantasy world, we live in the real world with bad people who will kill us or behead us at their earliest opportunity, then piss on our bodies.
Levin, McCain and Obama: Master Bridge Salesmen
" But he said the possible transfer was not a significant concession to the Taliban, provided the prisoners remain in custody. "If that's what [the Taliban] are getting, it's not much of a gain [for them], going from one prison to another."
MORONS.
I have a better idea - ship half of Congress and most of the WH back to "Pockeestan", as Ø calls it. I am sure Ø can get them superb accommodations from when he visited as a student and started planing his career with the ISI and Rashid Khalidi.
Maybe Panetta can get McCain and Levin seats at the execution of the Pakistani MD who will soon be killed by the "Taleebahn" / ISI for helping us get OBL, now that his name was released BY THE ØBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
Obama and the Dems (surface
Obama and the Dems (surface at least) are the idiots. McCain and Chambliss were the ones saying this was stupid and we shouldn't release them. McCain said he doesn't think Qatar will hold them in prison and neither do the Taliban, otherwise why would they be negotiating for this exchange? Unfortunately, he also said there's nothing much Congress can do to stop the Administration from making the transfer.
What is sad, is that Americans do not grasp that there are only two conditions in the world according to the Koran. Islam and non-Islam. If you are not Muslim, you are at war with Islam. Plain and simple. There is no compromise with Islam. To capitulate constantly is indeed a show of weakness that the Muslims will use to their advantage. Iran has already said they will destroy Israel and the United States.
This just shows how naive our country truly is...it is indeed a sad state of affairs.
There is the operative phrase. Rope A Dope. I keep saying that you just can't make this stuff up! But there they go again.
This just sickens me. These
This just sickens me. These guy's should have been put to death for their crimes against America, now the Obamanation is going to let them go! Let's see, commit an act of terrorism, kill several people, spend less than 10 years in prison, go home a hero to your people. Thank's Obama I have no words to express the way I feel about you and your policies.
Terrorists first Americans
Terrorists first Americans seconds. Love that pos democrat in office.

'..Taliban reconciliation
'..Taliban reconciliation efforts' - What the..?
Michigan residents, are you aware your 'representation' wants to make nice with a peoples who have a 'religious police' which publicly beats, kills women and children, is partnered with Al Qaeda, employs suicide bombers, destroys other than Islam places of worship, at most times with people in said place of worship, knowingly and with pride keep their people/ country living as dolts in stone-age like conditions, has thee most strict Sharia Laws thought possible? Ad infinitum..
And Levin wants to offer an olive branch to these POS?
Heck Levin's an American, supposedly and is wanting to recognize a terrorist organization as an equal?
The dude sounds like an enemy of the state..
...we also make Qatar take Reid, Feinstein, Levin, and Kerry into custody too? Put all twelve of them in one dark, dank cell together. Maybe even toss Pelosi in for good measure. Let's see what they think about the Taliban THEN!
From being there in Afghanistan, I have seen known Taliban released immediatly (within 1 day) after attackingAfghan civilians and soldiers and ISAF soldiers by local Afghan officials. If you think President Obama's orders releasing GITMO prisioners is horrific, the quagmire/corruption of the Afghan government and restrictions placed on ISAF under ROEs is the true horror. The members being released from GITMO have been out of the fight so long their usefulness on the battlefield is marginal.
usefulness on the battlefield
If a person can strap a bomb on their body, at least once, I wouldn't call that marginal.
I don't have a problem releasing them as long as we hang them first, video the process, let the corpses get smelly for a few days, pin a flash drive with video of the hanging to their eyeballs, and drop them into the "presidential" compound of Pockistan. We're going to have to kill these dirtbags in a most wholesale way sooner or later. The sooner the better for everyone. Mark my words.
Good idea...better yet....
Why not arm them as they leave so we can track their activities once freed...better yet...let's free them in different American cities with plenty of ammunition to show them just how much we trust them....Better yet...
we can put them in witness protection programs throughout the country give them new identies, Jewish names would be a nice touch and if by chance they do kill again we can have Haley Barbour commute their sentences so they know we're a forgiving christian society...
A statement is what Obama is after?! Hitler made a statement, even signed it, that he wouldn't attack Britain. The Taliban are, at the very least, as bad as Hitler, as untrustworthy, and as ruthless. They will be thrilled at the ignorance and naivity of the American president - IF - that is what is making this decision, but I don't believe so. He is just helping his muslim brothers (bortherhood) and the expense of lives everywhere else. Anyone who thinks these murders won't be in the field shorthly after exchanged hasn't been following radical islam.
While Retarded McCain is briefed on continuing unAmerican activities by the Obama Muslim regime, Americans continue to sleep, watching this illegal muslim destroys America. I wonder how long it will be for the American Stream to march on Washington to get this illegal dictator out of office...As this muslim continues to destroy America, I thought only blacks were the dumbest group of people on this earth...That is a fact, and there may be a few exceptions, but not many...The world sits back as this SOB, and rightfully stated, his mother was a Bitch, going from black man to black man, continues to destroy this great country...I do understand affirmative action, as mentally blacks cant (in most instances) compete on the same level, and must be given an opportunity to achieve some success in this world, However, this total useless idiot who was taught to read an idiot board, who makes his own laws which are unconstitutional, while the news media, along with the corrupt congress sits back and watches, needs to be tried for treason...It is really important, while and not for long...Free Speech should be screamed from every corner of the US, until this muslim Obama is defeated, and imprisoned for his criminal background...
Please re-read the article.
Please re-read the article. McCain does not agree with this transfer. If only the ultra-conservatives would have just voted for McCain instead of sitting it out we wouldn't have Obama in office. Now they are going to do the same thing with Mitt Romney because people like Rush Limbaugh say he's not conservative enough. Whether he's conservative enough or not, he's a thousand times better than Obama, so please, I beg you, vote for him if he gets the Republican nomination!
Well, Edwin, I just actually
Well, Edwin, I just actually read your entire post and now I don't want you to vote at all. You're a racist idiot!
Remember the Lockerbie bomber? The same thing will happen here.
I suggest that as these idiots impose on every doctor in Amerika, they present "Outcome based data" on this plan before being allowed to release anyone.
OR
personal responsibility: any of the released violate conditions of transfer or parole, the senators put their money where their mouths are and serve the rest of the time OR pay from their vast personal fortunes made off their meager government salaries for the recovery effort, OR if the released kills another human the Senator be held for contributing to the murder.
get real you bozos
There once was a terrorist thug,
Locked up in Gitmo safe and snug,
Instead of the noose,
Barack turned him loose,
Our soldiers again he will plug.
Why wouldn't He release them?
Why would obama not release his muslim brethren? You can tell what kind of person he is by the church and preacher he went to for 20 years, all his Anti-American policies, and antics, his Anti-White stance, his race baiting, his condemnation of Israel and pro stance for hamas and hezbolah...this is to be expected from the muslim-in-chief.
Obama is Public Enemy #1 - He is a Marxist
And we have had how many GIs die so this fool can do this to look good in the eyes of the Left, the world's Socialists and the Enemies of America? Obama must be Impeached now so that we can limit the damage he is doing to America and her

I’m living two blocks away from this library—and I don’t know why I was so elated about this—but I’m in my mesh jogging shorts in the elevator and I saw that my book “Swamplandia!” was their book club selection.

Apparently, someone has taken the Harry Styles and Taylor Swift break-up a bit hard. The UK music magazine NME has nominated Mr. Styles worthy of wearing the “Villain of the Year” crown.
Luckily, Harry isn’t the only one, and faces stiff competition from Prime Minister David Cameron, Skrillex, Azealia Banks, and Psy, reported Perez Hilton .
As if that wasn’t hard enough, Harry, along with the rest of One Direction, has been nominated for NME’s Worst Band, along with Muse, Mumford & Sons, Alt-J, Ed Sheeran, and Justin Bieber.
But this should probably be no surprise for the band as they were nominated for worst band last year as well and even took home the title, reports SugarScape .
Of course, 1D fans are outraged! Entertainmentwise says Super fan @michaelwood tweeted, “That One Direction are up for Worst band at the NME awards says more about the lamentable state of the NME than it does One Direction.”
The ceremony will occur February 7th. Will you be watching or boycotting?

NDC Organiser is a joker …says NPP parliamentary candidate
From Isaac Akwetey-Okunor, Koforidua
The opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) Parliamentary Candidate (PC) for New Juaben South Constituency in the Eastern Region, Dr. Mark Assibey-Yeboah has described the Eastern Regional Organizer of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) Mr. Bismark Tawiah Boateng as a joker.
According to the NDC stalwart, the ruling party would arrest the “ghost” that has hounded the party in the area for some timen now as the country goes to the polls in December. The NDC Regional Organizer claimed the impressive performance of the party in the entire region and the constituency in particular would lead the party to victory in the December elections.
Making the prediction during a zonal rally of the party in Koforidua last Tuesday to introduce the Parliamentary Candidate of the party, Dr. Kwaku Owusu Acheapong to the constituents, Mr. Tawiah Boateng said not only would the party win the parliamentary seat but would get at least 50 percent of the presidential votes in the region.
Mr. Tawiah Boateng hinted that, the NPP did not do anything to improve the lots of the people in the region in the eight years of their governance and that the NDC has demonstrated its commitment towards the development of the people in the region.
Responding to these claims in an interview with the Chronicle, the NPP candidate said the NDC organizer was day dreaming and called on him to wake up from his dream.
Despite admitting that he would not be complacent with his chances of winning the elections with a wider margin since elections cannot be predicted, he was still confident that NPP would retain the seat in the December elections. According to Dr. Assibey-Yeboah the NDC has not done anything for the people in the region which could woo them to turn their back to the NPP. He appealed to members of the party not to relent on the massive development record of the NPP but rather go out to campaign for the party towards victory.

Still think we won the Cold War? Of course you do…you are brainwashed. The US is having an economic crisis, but Russia isn’t? Why is that?
Russia’s Muslim terror proxies in Iran have been draining the American economy and Military since 9/11 (War against Capitalism). The sheep don’t believe anything unless a blond from Fox News is reporting it.
According to the list, compiled by analysts of WealthInsight, there are 64 billionaires in Moscow. The Russian capital thus comes second after New York City, which is a home to as many as 70 billionaires.

Devastated Savings and Home Values Drive Americans to Retire Abroad
Living abroad is a life-long dream of many and retirees and soon to be retirees; with mild climates and a lower cost of living, Central America’s easy access seems like an ideal place.
Exact numbers of people already in retirement overseas is difficult to find. Approximately 350,000 American retirees currently receive Social Security benefits abroad, according to the Social Security Administration’s annual report.
According to industry publication, Travel Market Report, approximately 3.3 million American baby boomers are planning to retire abroad.
Costa Rica has historically been a retirement haven for expats and has become one of the top destinations in Central America for Baby Boomers looking for a quality, healthy, convenient place for their retirement.
Costa Rica is famous for its natural beauty, laid back healthy lifestyle, fast and easier access from North America, it has all the key points retirees are looking for such as convenient hospitals and clinics, lower cost of living, little to no tax issues, political instability, personal safety, and climate.
Of the 10,000+ Baby Boomers retiring every day for the next 19 years (Pew report), one of their most pressing financial concerns is whether they will have enough money to pay for medical and long-term care expenses.
In a nutshell, Baby Boomers are looking for somewhere they can make their savings last and enjoy an active lifestyle, while staying healthy.
Most potential expats looking to retire in Costa Rica come first on vacation to get a firsthand look at what this country has to offer. The rental market is attractive for potential buyers exploring the country, for example, rent in San Jose can be over 50% less than most equivalent places in the USA.
Retirees looking to make their dollars go further are finding plenty of opportunity in Costa Rica’s real estate buyers market and discovering a new and exciting lifestyle in Central America.

A couple of months back, I won a jacket from Return to Sender’s blog! What are the chances right? Finally, after finding my camera charger and getting my camera charged, I needed to snap away!
Now, it has been HOT as Hades in Southern Cali (I have moved home!) and I had a fashion event (the really cool LA fashion blogger community- Fashion Two Point Oh!) to go to last night that was more lax than anything else, so I opted for my New CarmaKoma jacket and my Svoboda jeggings!
The jacket was quite roomy, lightweight, but held no punches on the funky and fierce factor!
I must give a big hug and kiss to my lil sister who shot my pics as I came in from the night’s festivities! Thank you sissy poo! Also, please forgive the lack of accessories, I could not find my fun pieces to play with!
What do you think? Want my jacket? You can snap up the Sagrada Jacket ON SALE! over at CarmaKoma!

Interview: Mike Allred Pt. 1
Categories: Interviews still had any doubts on the matter.
The book also helped to galvanize Allred, who began work the character’s latest staring role, Madman Atomic Comics, now on its seventh issue, which finds the artist rejuvenated and daring as ever.
We sat down with Allred to talk about how the new anthology helped the artist rediscover his old friend.
What was it like finally getting to hold the Gargantua in your hands, looking over the history of this character?
Definitely a milestone. First of all, it’s kind of an eye-opener to realize that I’ve done that amount of work [laughs], that we’ve amassed this collection that’s large enough to be used as a lethal weapon. It was also a great benefit in launching me forward and progressing my development, because I was almost forced to objectively revisit my progress, and I was able to look at moments where I was happy with the direction I was going in, and others where I was maybe treading water or regressing. So I saw my work with fresh eyes, and by doing so, I was able to really reassess what I wanted to do, and for that reason it kind of gave me a whole new lungful of air. I was really gratified and excited that this could come to exist, but also it reignited my enthusiasm for what I had in front of me, and where I wanted to go.
That second wind that the book gave you—was it really a personal thing, or was it specific to the Madman character?
That’s a good question. I always blur that line, so I’m not really sure. I put a lot of myself into all of the characters, and also people I know—friends, family members, character traits, quirks, experiences all kind of go through this filter that is my own mutant brain and kind of filters out on paper. Sometimes I’ll have a hard time looking at things objectively, at a distance—collecting Gargantua helped with that. Also, since I hadn’t done Madman for quite a while, as far as on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, when I’m in and doing it, it’s hard to maintain any kind of objectivity.
I have certain disciplines with my plots and notes and outlines that get lasered into a script and a series of scripts in a story arch and then attacking it with the best style I can—with what I want it to look like. I think, overall, I have a pretty consistent style, but I also try to do something a little different with each project, so X-Force looks a little different—even X-Statix, I tried to give it its own flavor. Even now with Madman Atomic Comics, there’s probably been one major artistic experiment with each issue. I’m also very conscious of trying to keep it settled, so it retains a certain consistency, so all of these things are consciously or subconsciously floating around inside of me, so then to differentiate from what’s personal and what’s character-driven—I don’t really think about it that much. I don’t even know how to answer that question [laughs].
You say that there’s a lot of you in these characters—I assume that goes double for Frank Einstein [Madman]—when you go back and read all of these arcs, do you ever find parts of you that you didn’t realize were there, when you were writing them?
Oh, absolutely. And that’s one of the things I’m most excited about, as far as where I am now. There are little elements that were just kind of laid out or seeded in passing, and looking back, I get excited. “Wow, I never took that to its full potential. I can do that now.” With the first story arc in Madman Atomic Comics, I realized that there was this main subplot that I had just left dangling, and that was this idea of Frank Einstein being one of The Four, with his great cosmic destiny. So this first story arc was completing that, tying that up. So, what I learned was that I didn’t really want to leave things dangling for so long.
What I wanted to do more of, which I had done with previous Madman arcs was to do a self-contained story and then move on to another one, which was really my original intent after the first series. Madman Adventures was going to be a series of self-contained adventures. That was a thing I realized I wanted to reconnect with. I want to do very genre-specific story ideas, as well. The first arc with the new series had this central theme that tied in with the whole cosmic space adventure idea. So now I’ve got film noir ideas and westerns.
Very genre-specific.
Yeah. But they are an initial inspiration, but that comes through what is a Madman adventure story. I’m not really forcing it, or making a point of it, but the inspiration is there, and if you’re aware that these things are what I’m excited about, you may recognize that. Otherwise, I’m hoping that it will be a little more subtle than that. But I really want that feel for everything that happens in here. And being that this is the one place where I can do anything I want, I want to take advantage of that, and looking back at what I’ve done over the past fifteen years with this character, I can see where I loved doing certain things and where I wished I’d pushed things a little further and where I forced things.
I’m trying to be my own most severe critic, but at the same time, after I’ve written it on the script, that’s where I just let go, and the joy of it comes through. Each part of the process becomes more enjoyable for me. With writing, I get excited to lock down an idea, but once they’re locked down, more enthusiasm comes in, because I’ve got that foundation there, and I can really relax more or let loose more with the artwork, and then it’s another series of locking things down, whether it’s the layout or the penciling or the inking or the tones at the end, and then I just sit back and Laura [Allred, Madman colorist and Mike’s wife] just punches those colors in, and “wow!” And then the book comes out and it’s really thrilling.
One thing that’s happened is, each time a book comes out, there’d be this tense anxiety, because something would always go wrong. The plates would be off or the colors wouldn’t be working as well. Especially when we first started working with computers. When we first started, Laura would watercolor these graylines, that would then get printed on this horrible paper with the registration off. We’d be excited—it’s our first color book—an then we get it back and it’s just crushing. And then we working with Bernie Mireault, where he’d do these animation-style cell colors and they came back looking beautiful, and how do we work toward that? And he, of course, being the colorist, had a different reaction, but we hadn’t seen the colors. We weren’t able to go online and see proofs, so now here we are, closer and closer to where what we see on the monitor is almost exactly what we see in print. So that’s one of the most exciting things in this progression. Once we let go of it, it’s almost exactly what we were hoping it would be, when it sees print.
Where there any moments in retrospect that didn’t seem like Madman stories? Where perhaps you had to force the character in there?
Not really. But sometimes I was focusing maybe more on a plot or a gimmick than his potential as a character, like his relationship with Dr. Flem had become strained. Frank Einstein—I see him as a child developing, and now he’s kind of like a high school graduate. And Flem being the last father figure in his life—I think at every point, a son has to stand up to his father, whether it’s as a sign of respect or rebellion, depending on what the relationship is.
Frank is now emotionally realizing that Flem has never really seen him as person, but more as a guinea pig—someone that he can take advantage of, and utilize in his experiments. So Frank is trying to come to this place where he can stand up to Flem and demand this respect or stand up to him like a father, and say, “hey, dad, I’m a man now. You need to treat me like one.” Before, where it would be plot-driven, now I’m able to integrate more of the characters into the plot. So that’s one thing I recognize from the past, but fortunately, I lot of people already assumed that that kind of deep characterization was already on the page. Hopefully it was there, but I’m seeing that it wasn’t there as much as I would have liked it to have been.
One story that I’m pleased about is when people reacted when they thought that his girlfriend, Joe, was killed. I wanted it to have impact, because I know what I want to do with this, and I know where this is going, and it’s ultimately going to lead to something really fun and joyful and a big payoff, but initially, there were some real angry people out there. I thought that I had laid enough of a path where they would know that this wasn’t just some blatant…
Way to sell books…
Exactly. It wasn’t like the death of Superman, a very cynical way to sell comic books. No one with half a brain their head that was aware of comic books really thought that Superman was dead.
Or that he’d stay dead.
Yeah, so it was just laughable when you saw mainstream media just go insane with this story. All of these people got taken advantage of, thinking that they were buying historical documents. But that wasn’t my approach. “This is going to be a collector’s item, the death of Joe.” No one really reacted that way, but what I didn’t expect was that people would really feel something. What’s really gratifying are the the people that reacted on the forums or wrote letters. That kind of involvement is really where I want to be with what I’m doing, where you really enjoy what’s on the page in front of you. Where you get excited about where you’re going, and where you’ve been.

The Clippers had some sort of sham public relations stunt Wednesday, giving fans the chance have an exciting bus ride around town with a few of the players. DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin were among the players involved in the event, and a camera filming the whole thing happened to capture Jordan and Griffin acting like a giddy couple of high school girls gossiping when they found out who will be giving them alley-oops this season. (I guess they forgot that their coach was still Vinny Del Negro and their owner was still Donald Sterling.)
At one point Jordan asks the person he’s talking to on the phone, “Who’d we give up?” Well, DeAndre, maybe you should ask Eric Gordon, who was also there part of the Clippers event. Yep. Awkward, indeed.

The Oneonta Charter Review Commission appreciated the opportunity to present the first full draft of the proposed Oneonta City Charter to the mayor and Common Council on June 7, and to a League of Women Voters forum on June 21.
This first draft is the next step in a process stretching back more than a year, during which the commission has:
"¢ interviewed former mayors, council members and department heads;"¢ compared the present charter with how city government actually works;"¢ held several public hearings;"¢ studied charters of over a dozen other cities similar to Oneonta in New York state;"¢ invited mayors, city managers and council members to Oneonta to learn from them; and
"¢ spent several months arriving at this draft.
As the process continues, as the commission will hold numerous briefings and public meetings with citizens and officials to gain further input and suggestions and to make modifications. The final draft will not be completed until September, and then will be put before voters in November. We welcome comments and questions from both city officials and residents.
As expected, most interest has centered on our proposal to provide a city manager for Oneonta. The commission feels strongly that, under the present charter, the Common Council is seriously overburdened having both to set policy for city government and to supervise its administration, and effective administration of an $18 million government is too much for a part-time mayor.
The best solution is a city manager, a full-time top administrator who will head up a new leadership team of city departmental directors, and who will be hired by the Common Council and report to the council.
Having a city manager will strengthen the Common Council by freeing it from the micromanagement of running the city on a day-to-day basis, enabling council members to focus on making policy. The council will have more time to think about how to solve our biggest problems and about what we want Oneonta to look like in the future. Most former mayors and many present and former council members agree with this recommendation.
The proposed charter retains a strong part-time mayor who presides over the Common Council. The mayor will remain the one elected official in the city who represents all the citizens of Oneonta.
Everyone from cities with a city manager stressed two points: one, clear and continuous communication by the city manager with the mayor and Common Council is vital; and two, if the council finds the city manager not complying with its wishes, it may fire the manager. Checks and balances are built into the draft charter, with the council ultimately in charge.
Other questions that have been raised include:
"¢ How would the city budget be prepared?
The mayor and council will set budget parameters, but the actual preparation will start with the departments under the direction of the director of finance (the present chamberlain), a process supervised by the city manager. The final budget will be decided, as now, by the mayor and council.
"¢ How would city employees be hired and fired?
The city manager will have these powers, which are not clearly stated in the present charter. The present and former mayors and many council members agree the city manager should have those responsibilities. Our recommendation is based on the need to simplify and clarify city employees' complex supervisory lines. City employees' legal job protections will not change.
"¢ Would the city manager be too strong, diminishing the role of department heads?
Oneonta is fortunate to be served by dedicated, capable department heads and employees. However, the challenge every city faces is to have all departments operating in smooth coordination with one another within the framework of city-wide policy and priorities set by the mayor and Common Council. The addition of a city manager will enhance the role of department heads by providing them expert and professional leadership, support and supervision — important functions that cannot be expected from a part-time mayor and Common Council.
The Charter Commission looks forward eagerly to more meetings with city officials, employees and citizens to gain further input and improve the present draft. Several public meetings on the draft charter will be held in coming weeks, focusing on the city's wards. That schedule will be announced soon. The public is invited to any or all of these meetings.
The next Charter Commission meeting, open to the public, will be 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, July 6, in the Council Chamber of City Hall at 258 Main St.
Copies of the draft charter are available from the City Clerk's office in City Hall and at Huntington Memorial Library. The draft may be viewed and downloaded online at. Questions and comments may be telephoned to 431-1351.
This commentary was submitted by Paul Scheele on behalf of the Oneonta Charter Review Commission. The commission is chaired by Dave Rissberger. Other members are Scheele, John Dudek, Martha Forgiano, Karen Geasey, Tom Kelly, Steve Londner, Larry Malone, Sarah Patterson, Kathryn Stuligross and Laurie Zimniewicz. Kathy Wolverton, city personnel director, serves as non-voting liaison to the commission.

Was Chicago Doctor Serial Killer London’s Jack The Ripper? Descendant Of American Murderer Investigates Links Between The Notorious Criminals – Daily Mail
One descendant of H.H. Holmes, the notorious Chicago man known as America’s first serial killer, now suggests his ancestor could actually have also been the London serial killer Jack the Ripper.
Jeff Mudgett, the great-great-great-grandson of the killer, has submitted handwriting samples from both Holmes and Jack the Ripper for review and handwriting experts have confirmed the likelihood they could stem from the same hand.
Now Mudgett is on a quest to see if the American, believed to have killed 200 victims before he was caught in 1894, had made any documented visits to London around the same time with the killing wave swept through London.
………………
Serial killer: H.H. Holmes confessed to killing 27 people before he was caught in 1894, but many believe he was responsible for the deaths of 200
Scene of crime: The Murder Castle, circa 1893, was designed by Holmes to have secret passage ways and body chutes to transport bodies
Herman Webster Mudgett, known as H.H. Holmes, was a wealthy and well-educated doctor in Chicago, where he moved in 1884 from his native New Hampshire.
He eventually became owner of a drugstore and opened a hotel in Englewood, a suburb of the Windy City.
But the 60-room boarding house was a murder trap – having been constructed to allow the proprietor easy access to his victims.
Dubbed ‘the murder castle’ he designed the structure with windowless rooms equipped with gas lines
and body chutes so he could transport his sedated or already dead victims to the basement of the hotel.
Hidden: A diagram that appeared in the Chicago Tribune showed the secret passage ways inside of the ‘Murder Castle’ where Holmes could easily move his victims to the basement
Striking: Jeff Mudgett enlisted handwriting experts to compare the handwriting of H.H. Holmes and Jack the Ripper. The experts say they likely came from the same hand
Some victims were locked in their bedrooms, that were soundproof and fixed with gas lines, so they would be asphyxiated.
Others were kept in a soundproof bank vault, where they would be kept and ultimately would suffocate.
Once the victims died, hidden body chutes would allow Holmes to drop their sedated or dead bodies to the basement of the hotel, where he would dissect the corpses – selling the skeletons to medical schools.
………………
Deadly: Jack the Ripper (portrayed in the 2001 film From Hell) is believed to have killed five prostitutes in London in 1888
Holmes was finally caught and admitted to killing 27 people, though some suspect he was to blame for 200 deaths.
He was hanged in May 1896.
He had been married to three different women and had an unknown number of children.
Jeff Mudgett learned of his terrifying heritage when his grandmother decided to investigate their lineage as part of a growing tend among families wishing to find out more about their family tree.
‘It left him questioning everything he thought he knew about himself and his family. The new information forever changed him, propelling him down a new path in search of the truth,’ according to an interview he gave to Ancestry.com.
He began looking into the heinous crimes of his ancestor and the inquiry took a turn, when he began to notice similarities in Mudgett’s modus operandi and that of Jack the Ripper.
………………
Jeff Mudgett learned of his family history at the age of 40
‘Jeff per cent match.’
Jack the Ripper was the title given to the unidentified killer who preyed upon the poor and immigrant communities of London in 1888, killing five.
It’s believed that this killer targeted female prostitutes, whose throats were slashed before the perpetrator mutilated their internal organs.
The abdominal mutilation caused many to believe the killer was surgically trained.
The identity of the murderer has remained unknown but he has arguably become the world’s most famous killers, even a century after his deadly spree.

Nathan Bransford is a pretty cool literary agent (even tho he isn't interested in my book at this time). As he mentioned recently, the publishing industry is in a contraction mode, in the midst of overall growth.
Simultaneous contraction and growth? How could that be? My explanation: there is more than one publishing industry - there's the big old dinosaur publishing houses, and the smaller, indie/self-pub companies (like Lulu, or Peachpit Press - also cool, also not interested at this time). Guess which one I'm more interested in, philosophically and practically.
As Nathan writes, ."
I understand the math behind blockbusters - JK Rowling is richer than the queen (and her publisher probably didn't do too bad either). But chasing after that rare blockbuster doesn't make much sense to me, as a corporate strategy. It's the whole "all your eggs in one basket" scenario. Far wiser, it seems to me, to tap in to that long tail and have a bunch of writers (ala netflix, amazon, etc), selling more (in aggregate) than the blockbuster writer ever could. And this interweb thing is making it faster, cheaper and easier to do most of the traditional tasks done by big publishing houses. My prediction - the indie guys win in the end.
And by the way, Nathan, I'm selling tens of copies, not two's of copies...

When it comes to Mother’s Day, it’s all about gifts from the heart. I was challenged by Walmart, as a part of the Walmart Moms, to share some of my Mother’s Day gift ideas. So with the giftcard provided I headed to my local Walmart to see what kind of gifts I could put together to create my own gift basket for Mom.
When shopping for Mom on Mother’s Day, I’m of course on the hunt for …[ Read More → ]

How does the saying go? April showers brings May flowers? We’ve definitely seen a lot of showers lately. Being stuck indoors on a rainy Spring day isn’t very fun, but I know the garden loves and needs the rain. Whenever the sun is out, my family and I love to be outside. We also enjoying planting gardens and watching them grow.

Between gardening and spring cleaning, I’ve been keeping pretty busy lately. I was recently asked by Walmart as part of the Walmart Moms to try out a fairly new product called the O-Cedar O-Duster Robotic Floor Cleaner. I’ve heard of the product before through a couple of advertisements I’ve seen on TV and was wondering how it worked and what it did. So when they sent a sample unit, I was eager to give it a …

It seems to be a recurring theme on Freakonomics. This new NBER working paper by economists Scott E. Carrell and Bruce Sacerdote deals with the idea of educational incentives. They found that even those incentives that are offered to students late in their senior year of high school, can impact college outcomes, but not if it’s only money given and the impact is not the same for all students , as you already can discover in the abstract (you can download the paper here):.

Just a friendly reminder that I want to own one of these. It’s been a little while since we talked about it. And I only bring it back up now because I’m keeping the dream alive. This puppy could cost you up to $3,000 from Design Within Reach. I am DIABOLICALLY opposed to that sum of money. But the other night I was cruising down Lincoln through Venice at warp speeds when I passed a storefront that had one of every imaginable color out on the sidewalk. I have to get back over there on a Saturday to see what the asking price is there.
Design completely out of anyone’s Reach!
I went into one the other night, and left mad… Upset.

Recently I overheard a elderly couple in their last moments together at the airport with their daughter. They had announced the departure. Standing near the security gate, they hugged and the father said, 'I love you, and I wish you enough.'
The daughter replied,'Dad, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you and Mon enough, too.' They kissed and the daughter left.
The Couple walked over to the window where I was seated. Standing there I could see they wanted and needed to cry.
I tried not to intrude on his privacy, but they welcomed me in by asking, 'Did you ever say good-bye to someone knowing it would be forever?' 'Yes, I have,' I replied. 'Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever good-bye?' 'We are old, and she lives so far away. We have challenges ahead and the reality is - the next trip back will be for one of our funerals,' he said.
'When you were saying good-bye, I heard you say, 'I wish you enough..' May I ask what that means?' The elderly man began to smile. 'That's a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone...' He paused a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail, and he smiled even more. 'When couple again!!!

To continue my proclamation of amor for my favorite food group, let’s play a little game of name that tune.
I love carbs, carbs, carbs, carbs
Carbs, I do adore
Sound familiar? No? Okay, maybe it’s not a real song. Maybe I just replaced the word carbs for girls in Jay-Z’s “Girls, Girls Girls.” But it’s catchy, no? Perhaps it’s time for a food-themed remix, jigga.
So you’re probably wondering: ¿por que are we still talking about carbs?
I don’t doubt that I effectively communicated the fact that I love my carbs on Friday. However, while most of you embraced my carby adoration, I did receive one anonymous carb-condemning comment.
It went as follows:
Wow you really eat alot of carbs. Ever heard of “everything in moderation”? I find it interesting that your studying nutrition yet promoting such a reckless dietary approach. Your clients are gonna be obese.
Lovely, no?
I usually let negative anonymous comments fall by the wayside—and I won’t bother addressing the grammatical mishaps (oh, wait…)—but I do feel obliged to come to the defense of my beloved carbs.
Dear Anonymous Carb/Me-Hater,
Yes, I eat a lot of carbs. (Some may even go so far as to call me carbzilla.) And, yes, I’ve heard that whole “everything in moderation” spiel. (In fact, it’s sort of the backbone of my food philosophy.) But who says high-carb equates to a “reckless dietary approach?” Sure, there are a lot of nutritional experts who preach low-carb, high-protein diets. But, for every R.D. telling you to put down that piece of bread, there’s another telling you to open up wide, chew that carby goodness and get skinny. My point is that there is no one right dietary approach. We’re all different. And we all have different dietary needs. My body happens to feel its healthiest when I give it lots of carbs. Yours may not (in which case, I send my condolences).
Carbingly yours,
Sarah a.k.a. Carbzilla
Don’t believe me on the high-carb thing? Let’s take a gander at what I studied en escuela this weekend.
Well, what do you know? I’m not alone on this whole “carbs can do the body good” thing.
Can you imagine how excited I was to open my handout folder and find this at the top of the pile? Yes, the first order of business at escuela was studying the history, progression and validity of high carb diets. (This made me wonder if IIN has ESP/reads my blog?) Needless to say, I was fascinated and jotted down every word mi profesor said regarding the benefits of getting our carb on.
I also used this carbspiration as an excuse to wander down to Whole Foods during my lunch break and pick up some new carb goodies.
(Yea, I shop at Whole Foods with a Trader Joe’s bag. Blasphemy.)
I can’t wait to experiment with these—especially the millet!
Among other topics like protein, calorie requirements and the macrobiotic diet, we also learned about the principles behind The South Beach Diet. (This further fed my suspicion that my school has ESP/reads my blog, as I just mentioned The South Beach Diet on Friday.) Our guest lecturer was Dr. Arthur Agatston, the author of The South Beach Diet. Despite having a not-so-fun personal foray into South Beach dieting, it was fascinating to learn about how and why he developed the diet. For the record, even Dr. Agatston addressed the benefits of carbs. Just saying…
Since all this carb talk is only further perpetuating my carbzilla reputation, I will now switch gears to another (newly) beloved c-food: cottage cheese.
Since we last spoke, I’ve been through three containers of cottage cheese. In defense of cottage cheese/me, I really wanted to try out so many of your cottage cheese recommendations. All in the name of experimentation, mis amigas.
Let’s get to the cottage cheese creations.
En el bol: 1/2 cup oats cooked in 1 cup almond milk with 1/3 cup pumpkin, 1/3 cup TJ’s high fiber cereal (random) and 1/3 cup cottage cheese stirred in at the end. Dressed in maple syrup, pumpkin pie spice and whipped crema.
I’m not sure what inspired this crazy concoction—I was mostly just craving a ridiculously creamy bowl of oats—but I’m glad I went with it. I usually just cook my oats in water, but the almond milk, plus the cottage cheese addition at the end, created the perfect creamy consistency.
One more point for cottage cheese being the greatest thing ever.
More pumpkiny cottage cheese oats were had.
This time, eggs were added. And, OHMYGOD, make this now.
The mezcla: 1/2 cup oats, 3/4 cup water, 1/2 cup egg whites. 1/2 cup cottage cheese and 1/2 cup pumpkin stirred in at the end.
Okay, the abundantly eggy (almost custard-like) oats mixed with creamy cottage cheese and pumpkin gloriousness? I’m pretty sure my taste buds discovered new heights of ecstasy.
Onto some cottage cheese snack recommendations.
Almost all of you mentioned the cottage cheese + preserves combo, so I knew I needed to go there.
Increible. In this concoction, I used put the raspberry preserves atop 2% whipped cottage cheese, per another recommendation.
I liked the whipped version—but I have to say, I really missed the little chunks/curds/whatever other gross term can be used to describe the consistency of cottage cheese.
Worry not, I got my curd fix in my next snack experiment.
1/2 cup applesauce + 1/2 cup cottage cheese.
Definitely one of the most brilliant cottage cheese suggestions thrown my way. I’ve eaten this combo at least once a day since trying it—mostly because it sort of reminds me of cheesecake.
I also did a bit of savory cottage cheese investigation.
Another suCCess.
Lastly, we have the least photogenic—but possibly the most delicious—of my experiments in cottage cheesedom.
Cottage Cheese and Hummus Stuffed Portobello
1 Portobello cap brushed with EVOO + sea salt on both sides. Baked at 400° for 5 minutes. Removed from oven and smeared with 2 tbsp. roasted red pepper hummus. Topped with 1/2 cup cottage cheese mix with 1 diced roasted red pepper. Returned to the oven to broil for 3 minutes.
Broiled brilliance. I was pretty skeptical of how cottage cheese would taste post-broilage, but the crispy cottage cheese layer that formed was amazing.
The only fail was the fact that—due to aforementioned skepticism—I only made one. Muy triste.
Preguntas: I didn’t go into too much detail about escuela because I wasn’t sure how much you want to know. Do you want to hear more on what I’m learning? Or more about the experience as a whole? Oh, and, since you gave my such amazing cottage cheese recommendations last time, do you have any more that I must try? I’d be happy to oblige
.
Hope you’re having a bueno you-kn0w-what día, mis foodies!
Amor,
Sarah
What brand do you find the whipped cottage cheese in? I hate the curds/chunks but would love the whipped!
oh snap girl! LOVE yo CREATIONS!! isnt eggs and CC the BEST things since PB to put into oats?! soo freaking DELISH!! love it!!
i am dying to try whipped! i cant find it!
ahh sorry about the carb HATAAAA. nobody ever died from eating a lot of healthy carbs!
love youuu!
i JUST rolled my eyes and yelled, “GET OVER THE CARB THING” at one of my co-workers who looked at my plain sweet potato and sighed, “oh i wish i could have a sweet potato. too many carbs…”
I want to hear all about school
You NEEEEEEEED to try my cottage cheese/raisin/Thousand Island/red onion combo. I know it sounds hideous, but it is so.freaking.amazing. I just wrote cottage cheese on my hand so I remember to buy some. Granola + CC + banana = next week’s breakfasts.
We don’t get whipped cottage cheese here
Though we do get some crazy flavours- tomato basil, shrimp, chilli, etc.
Love this post! Carbs are not the enemy, just like fat isn’t the enemy. Some veggies have the same carb value as a bagel. It’s all portion size!
Good for you for standing up to that rude anon comment!!
Have you tried red quinoa, it is awesome!!
Seriously, some people are just carb-phobic (thank you Atkins). Apples, bananas, all carbs, no? Jeez. Carbs are my friend, all day every day.
Sadly cottage cheese is forboden in my diet
but yeah it goes with everything if you can eat it. One of my top 3 comfort foods growing up was bowtie pasta with cottage cheese. Holy amazing.
That anonymous commenter may suck it.
Glad you liked the Cottage Cheesecake
way to put the anonymous carb-hater in his/her place
and yes! i’d love to hear more about escuala! and i think i need to go restock pumpkin so i can make those amazing pumpkin cottage cheese oats–yummm!
It sounds like you are loving learning about all of that great info! I am happy to see someone who is absorbing everything they are paying to learn! That is rare…
ha, great post – I love carsbs as well!
Omg what a silly thing to say…carbs=my life…having fought an ED i feel that comments like that are why so many girls in society are too scared to pick up a piece of bread and eat the darn thing. Thank you for addressing this and showing ppl that its not about fitting into what society thinks is right but doing whats right for your body!
Great post!
Keep it going sarah!
-Lena
I swear you can mix cottage cheese with anything and its awesome. IIN sounds sooooo interesting, I would love to hear more about what you’re learning. It seems like the type of place I would enjoy learning at.
I am so happy you commented on my blog. It lead me to yours, and it is absolutely terrific!
I love your background…i love writing…i have university science degrees though and stuck in a career that i hate …but so much debt i am seriously “stuck” there…i love writing…i just actually need to do it more…currently spend more time reading
what a great blog !
omg so glad you stood up for ourself- its not like carbs are ALL you eat- wtf… idont know why he/she would make such a rude comment?? i love your eats! so delicious
xoxo
shelley
I was cheering and fist pumping throughout this whole post. From your defense of carbs to you cottage cheese concoctions…I just love you.
Carbs and I are best friends. I’m pretty close with fats and protein, too, but carbs and I just have a connection. Ignore the haters and keep on chowing!
Hey! I’m happy to have found your blog too
I’m also a carb-lovin’ nutrition student. When will people learn that no macronutrient is “bad??”
A life without bread, oatmeal, sweet potatoes? Craziness!
I’ve tried Millet once before and it was good! But those little grains get EVERYwhere
um so seriously anon has some unresolved issues with carbs. I want to shove that millet in their boca.
on that note, i’m going to go eat peanut butter and *gasp* TOAST. oh yes I di-idddd.
Psssh, dude I say eat whatever you want. I love carbs, and completely agree that different foods work for people in different ways, and we all process food in different ways. Enjoy your carby-goodness!
Go ahead and get your carb on, girl! Good carbs = energy moron anon! I have one can of pumpkin left in my pantry, and thanks to that first bowl of oatmeal I’m pretty sure I will be breaking it out for breakfast tomorrow. My cottage cheese fix today was had with half a banana, Stevia, and cinnamon. Perfecto!
Hmmm, maybe I should rethink my dislike of cottage cheese?!
i would like to continue to hear about cottage cheese and carbs. because they are amaze.
seriously if you whip cottage cheese and pumpkin in a blender it makes amazingness. a-may-zing-aling-ness.
by the way your shroom caps are genius. just sayin
Ohh anonymous commenters are so annoying sometimes. I really think that diets are personal..some people do better with a higher carb intake. Obviously anonymous is nutrition ignorant.
Thanks for visiting my blog and for the sweet comment!
Oh my goodness I’m loving all the cottage cheese creations! I can’t get enough of that stuff, I’m definitely trying these combos!
And I would love to hear more about what you’re learning in school/how you feel about it!
defend carbs. I love oats, bread, more bread, cereal…carbs are friends. they provide fuel to workout! haha and Im so nt creeped out u caught that Auntie flow comment in my post lol… i jst hope she doesnt ruin my weekend day drinking adventures….
ahhhh come to chicago ASAP and por favor.
xooxox
lolomon
You’re giving me so many good snack ideas here, I LOVE cottage cheese!
Love this post. Carbs in general are not bad, but there are certain carbs that are healthier than others – you obviously eat an abundance of whole grain, healthy carbs so I’m not sure what the anon reader was thinking.
i have a whole carton of cottage cheese looking for inspiration! i’m gonna try your broiling method…
food looks amazing and the anons. girl. I get some doosies. WAY worse than that. Trust me. Between the vegan raw thing (ie. vegan police) and the fact that im in a sports bra doing yoga poses, you can imagine some of the choice words i get. Shrug em off, i know easier said than done, but you’re fabulous and we know it. xoxo
You’ve got to love how the catty commenters are always annoymous! If you want to discuss something at least have the guts to admit who you are.
I am totally in defence of carbs, mostly because the average Westerner eats waaaaay too much protein anyway and also carbs are the yummy!
Good on you for defending carbs! But… and I hope you don’t take this the wrong way… I sometimes find that I really don’t understand as much as 20% of your posts because of all the Spanish in them. I’m assuming you are from Spanish-speaking descent, so please don’t think I’m being racist or anything! I have nothing against that
I’m just saying – some words are very easy to assume a meaning from like escuela obviously = school. And most people know ones like para mi, mi casa, etc. But other times I just have no idea what you’re talking about, lol! It frustrates me to not understand what you’re saying because I’m interested in your posts – obviously haha. Please PLEASE don’t take this as a hater comment. It’s just… an opinion? Constructive criticism, maybe? Ugh, sorry. I sound like a b!tchface! I’ll stop now.
I get really frustrated when I hear people trash-talking carbs, too. I try to stick up for them, lol.
And cottage cheese is the only food that I’v been seeing all over that still grosses me out, but I want to like…and I think your successes with it may have me convinced to try it!
I for one want to hear ALL about your school and what you are learning! That way I can live vicariously through your experience, because it sounds amazing and you’ll be learning so much! So yes, share, share, share! Mmm your hummus veggie baked creations always look so good.
I would like to point out that the anonymous carb hater used the incorrect form of “your”. It should be “you’re”. Maybe if the person had some more carbs (which are the brains primary fuel) then she or he wouldn’t have made such a grievous error!
Whoa, that sounded a little harsh. Apologies!
Yay for carbs (and fats!)!
OMG. Whoever left that comment…..ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!?!??!?!??!?!!?!? Wow, I’m agro(vated). Fa sho. You are probably one of my favorite bloggers because you ACTUALLY eat! You have such a healthy outlook on livin’, eatin’ and doin’ yo thang–and because of that you’re one of the most gorg, fit and fierce gals out there! You know what works for you….and damn, you don’t even eat THAT much carb. Que ridiculoso!
Onto the food…
So I’m trying that CC + apple sauce combo asap!! Cheesecake you say? I’m in. And that baked creation–pure genius right thurr.
YOU BETTER TRY THE CC MESS SOON!!!! Looove you!
Xoxo, lil’ J
yum i love cottage cheese to i am definitely trying that omelette…what i have learned about carbs( as a girl who ate meat for an entire year and nothing but meat) is that those who view carbs as “bad” arent going to change and those who view them as “good” arent going to change. different info from different sources…when the reality is genes and heredity have the biggest impact on how your body handles carbs. there is not fight in the fact that “dietary carbs are not needed by the body”
good lookin foods you got i think i need to read the previous carb post though!
People are so rude. I can’t imagine having so much free time that I could go around reading blogs and leaving nasty comments…ANY WHO
Lots of deliciousness on here! Quinoa is such a yummy grain- you can do tons with it- I need to do more experimenting.
Your oats bowl with cottage cheese looks SO good…I just wish I liked cottage cheese.
I would love to hear more about what you’re learning in school!!
That cottage cheese omelet looks incredible! Cottage cheese and pineapple is fantastic, but my fave is cottage cheese and FF French dressing. I eat it pretty much every day. (I buy 4 large tubs of CC every week BTW, as long as it’s low fat I feel totally okay about eating it.) Ooh and girl, I am with you on the carbs. My work girlfriends call me ‘carb whore’.
holy moly cottage cheese…and i’m not talking about the kind on my ass. these concoctions are unique, brilliant and FABULOUS! i don’t believe for one minute you are uninspired
okay, so i have professed this before, but i am mucho scared of sweet cottage cheese. please convince me it will be okay. i need it.

CHICAGO (thefutoncritic.com) -- The latest development news, culled from recent wire reports:
THE BIG ISLAND (A.K.A. UNTITLED PETER ELKOFF PROJECT) (FOX) - Peter Elkoff's ("Mr. Beautiful") drama project at FOX has been given the go ahead to produce a pilot. The drama, which tracks a group of twentysomething employees who work at a luxury hotel on Hawaii's Big Island, has been in development since February of last year (read the story) at which time music video director Dave Myers was attached to helm the pilot. It's not clear if Myers is still attached to the 20th Century Fox Television project, however Kevin Falls ("The West Wing") has come on board to executive produce along with Elkoff.
BOSTON PUBLIC (FOX) - In a follow-up to our earlier story about the series being placed on hiatus (read the story), sources close to the show have indicated production will halt after the 15th episode wraps shooting this week. Despite being widely believed to have a full season order of 22 episodes for its fourth season, "Boston" apparently was only picked up for 13 episodes this season and extended for an additional two last month. FOX was reportedly considering ordering even more episodes however plans to bring on a new female lead to revamp the series never came through. Networks reps nevertheless are insisting the show hasn't been canceled and remains in contention for FOX's fall 2004 schedule. Should it be axed however, FOX is said to be open to ordering a 16th episode to wrap-up the series.
THE CATCH (A.K.A. UNTITLED J.J. ABRAMS PROJECT) (ABC) - J.J. Abrams' bounty hunter drama has been given the green light to produce a pilot. The project, which stars Greg Grunberg ("Alias"), is expected to be considered for midseason 2005 as the prolific producer will focus on "Lost" (see the story below) first before moving on to "The Catch."
THE D.A. (ABC) - Felicity Huffman ("Sports Night") has signed on to appear in a multi-episode arc on the midseason drama. No additional details were available.
EDEN (NBC, New!) - Mark Burnett ("The Apprentice," "Survivor") is once again trying to get into the scripted game as the producer has landed a script commitment from NBC for a new series about young people on a summer study cruise who end up shipwrecked on a remote island. Burnett has teamed with writer Douglas Day Stewart ("An Officer and a Gentleman") on the project, which will be co-produced by Brunett's production company and NBC Studios should it go forward. NBC has committed to a pilot script, a backup script and a series bible for the series as well as a substantial penalty should it not go to pilot. While the original scope of the series is for a limited run of 13 episodes, the project could evolve into an ongoing weekly soap. Burnett, Stewart and Conrad Riggs will executive produce.
THE GOODBYE GIRL (TNT) - A somewhat lackluster 3.5 million viewers (1.6 million among viewers 18-49) tuned into the cable channel's premiere of its "Goodbye Girl" remake on Friday. The telefilm however delivered 6.2 million total viewers overall (5.5 million viewers in 18-49) over the course of its three-day play on the network (Friday, Saturday and Sunday this past weekend).
HARRY GREEN AND EUGENE (A.K.A. JOE GREEN AND EUGENE) (ABC) - The Alphabet's dramedy from the team behind FOX's short-lived "Keen Eddie" - actor Mark Valley, writer Joel Wyman, director Simon West, executive producer Warren Littlefield and Paramount Network Television - has been given the go ahead to produce a pilot. Valley stars in the dramedy as Harry Green, a Los Angeles private investigator whose life is complicated when his inept brother Eugene comes to town. As previously reported West will direct the pilot from a script by Wyman with the duo executive producing along with Warren Littlefield and Jib Polhemus. The Littlefield Co. and Frequency Films are also behind the Paramount-produced project.
I WANT TO MARRY RYAN BANKS (ABC Family) - Just 1.8 million viewers tuned into the telefilm's premiere on Sunday, off 36% from the network's last original - December's "Picking Up and Dropping Off," which scored 2.8 million viewers.
KAT PLUS ONE (UNTITLED MAGGIE FRIEDMAN PROJECT) (ABC) - The Alphabet has given a production green light to produce a pilot for the drama, which comes from writer Maggie Friedman ("Dawson's Creek") and "Everwood" executive producers Greg Berlanti and Mickey Liddell. The project revolves around a New York publicist who must suddenly raise a 6-year-old boy when her sister and brother-in-law die. Berlanti and Liddell's Warner Bros. Television-based Berlanti-Liddell Productions is behind the pilot.
THE L WORD (Showtime) - 936,000 total viewers watched the two-episode opener to the much-hyped lesbian drama, which averaged a 0.5 national rating among adults 18-49. While far from spectacular, both scores are on par with "Queer as Folk's" third-season opener (1.1 million) and the premiere of the controversial telefilm "The Reagans" (1.2 million).
LIFE OF LUXURY (ABC) - ABC has committed to four additional installments of the Robin Leach-hosted special, which premiered to a strong 9.3 million viewers this past December. Two of the new "Luxury" specials are expected to roll out this spring with the other two coming in the fall. Andy Friendly Productions is behind the project, which will add a contemporary co-host to serve alongside Leach for the new installments.
LOST (ABC, New!) - J.J. Abrams ("Alias") and Damon Lindelof ("Crossing Jordan") are set to team for a new drama at the Alphabet which follows a group of people stuck on a Pacific island and are forced to build a new society after surviving a plane crash. The project is actually a revamped take on "Nowhere," a drama from executive producer Aaron Spelling and writer Jeff Lieber, which ultimately did not go forward. ABC has ordered a pilot and six additional scripts for the new project, which comes from Touchstone Television, with Abrams and Lindelof executive producing. The producers plan to shoot the pilot, as well as the series should it go forward, on location.
LUCKY US (FOX, New!) - 20th Century Fox Television and Original Television are behind a new comedy at FOX about a mismatched couple who wind up permanently linked after their blind date results in an unexpected pregnancy. Holly Hester ("Sabrina, the Teenage Witch") will write and executive produce the project, which has been given a pilot commitment, along with Original's Marty Adelstein, Neal Moritz and Dawn Parouse.
MY BEST FRIEND IS A BIG FAT SLUT (Oxygen, New!) - The cable channel has pacted with Carsey-Werner-Mandabach ("That '70s Show," "Whoopi," "The Tracy Morgan Show") for the network's first original scripted series, a half-hour comedy about a pair of Minnesota twentysomethings who move to L.A. in search of the Hollywood life. Writer Claudia Lonow ("Less Than Perfect") created the series, which is being targeted for an April premiere date. Bree Turner ("Bring It On Again"), Joy Gohring ("Not Another Teen Movie"), Kevin Christy ("Love Don't Cost a Thing"), Brent King ("Without a Trace") and Nicole Hiltz ("Cold Case") have all been cast in the comedy, CWM's first original series for cable.
RELATED BY FAMILY (FOX) - Amy Yasbeck ("Wings") has joined the cast of the comedy pilot, which comes from writer/producer Victor Fresco ("Andy Richter Controls the Universe") and Paramount Network Television. Yasbeck will play the mother in the comedy, which focuses on two very different teenagers forced to live under the same roof when their parents remarry.
UNTITLED EILEEN HEISLER/DEANN HELINE PROJECT (NBC, New!) - The Peacock has ordered a pilot from writer/producers DeAnn Heline and Eileen Heisler ("Three Sisters") for a new comedy about a romance between an unlikely couple. No additional details were released about the project, which will be produced by NBC Studios.
UNTITLED SHELDON TURNER PROJECT (FOX, New!) - Feature writer Sheldon Turner ("The Longest Yard") has landed a blind script commitment from 20th Century Fox Television to develop a new drama series for the network and studio. Turner spent the past development season on an untitled drama set in the world of gunrunning at 20th from feature director John Woo's Lion Rock Productions.
UNTITLED VICTORIA GOTTI PROJECT (A&E, New!) - Star magazine gossip columnist, and daughter of the late mob boss John Gotti, Victoria Gotti is set to be the focus of a new reality series about her personal life and career as a tabloid journalist. Production is already underway on the untitled pilot, which could air as soon as this summer should it be picked up to series. The project is expected to track her transition to editor-in-chief of Red Carpet, a new magazine from Star publisher American Media.

Filed under: desserts, healthy stuff, low fat, product review
I really really wish autumn would get here and stay here already. Here in middle Tennessee, we're experiencing cold-ish nights and 80-something degree days. Ick. Because I recently started school again, I decided it was time to invest in the grand daddy of all crockpots--the programmable kind with automatic warm setting when your dish is finished. This baby even has a meat probe that will turn the appliance to warm once the meat's internal temp reaches the desired heat. AND I caught a sale at Kohl's, so it wasn't nearly as expensive as I was thinking it was going to...

Have you ever gone to the grocery store, and they have these portobello mushrooms all wrapped up and prettily stuffed with mozzarella and spinach? I see them all the time, and I always think to myself, "I could do that." But I never do. This past week, though, I did. I could not think of anything for dinner. I didn't really have any instant cravings for anything, so I grabbed my own portobellos, and I brought them home because I had the cheese and baby spinach at home. As usual, something else struck me as I was making these, and I...

Recipe Review: Paula Deen’s Gorilla Bread
Filed under: breakfast ideas, desserts, fancy made easy, recipe reviews
My husband saw this recipe this past weekend, and he insisted on making it. His mom usually makes monkey bread for Christmas morning, and it is a serious favorite. Gorilla bread is apparently monkey bread on steroids...meaning the sweet biscuit bites are filled with cream cheese and cinnamon sugar. I'm gonna go ahead and tell you that it is a 5 out of 5, a 10 out of 10, and 100%! I was going to take off points for the high calorie content, but these little nuggets of deliciousness are just too good. And I just can't make myself care because...,...

So school started back at the beginning of August. But I was there at the tale end of July for teacher meetings and stuff. And I have been trying to get a chance to post the entire time! Things have gotten crazy around here. I haven't even had time to read my friends' blogs and the other usual daily blogs I read. So I guess I should recap what's been going on and tell you what some future posts are going to be about. 'Cause I've had a reawakening in the kitchen. What's been happenin': had a great 4th of July...
Honey Lime Shrimp Kabobs
Filed under: easy dinners, fancy made easy, healthy stuff, you have got to try this!
You know when you have a big project and you tell yourself you will not do anything else until it is finished? That is what I feel like these days. A 264 page publication is set to come out in August, and I need to get it done. But I do have to cook. And last night I had a creative moment in the form of this marinade. We bought some great shrimp at Publix, and the evening had cooled off enough to use the grill. Unfortunately, our propane tank lost its juice. But that's okay because these kabobs can...
Pam’s Broccoli Salad
Filed under: salad, you have got to try this!
Recently, my mom visited our old home town (the one they moved away from after Katrina because it would never be the same anymore). She stayed with my cousin Pam. I always did enjoy going to her house for Thanksgivings and Christmases because I am an only child, but I love LOVE big family gatherings. Pam has two great kids who I used to babysit when I was in high school. I can't believe one has graduated high school, and the other is a senior this year! While visiting, Pam made this broccoli salad. When m0m told me about it, I...
Mama’s Summer Peach Pie
Filed under: desserts, fancy made easy, Truly Southern Recipes, you have got to try this!
Sometimes I could just hit myself. I made a peach pie yesterday, ate a slice before it set in the refrigerator, and only THEN realized that my blogger friends might like this! I am smack dab in the middle of finishing the yearbook, and I think I am delirious. If you've ever worked on a yearbook, you understand the nightmares involved in publishing 268 pages of (mostly) student work. I say "mostly" because I simply have to do some of it because folks disappear in the summer. But it's cool. I don't mind it...too much. Which is why this pie is...
Mojito Love
Filed under: beverage recipes, recipe reviews
I have loved mojitos for as long as I can remember. I have always tried to make them by some recipe I found online or in a cocktail book, but it just was not good. We have SOOO much mint that grew back this year, so I really felt the pressure more than ever to make a good mojito. It didn't help my cravings when we were at the beach one day, and my sister-in-law mentioned how a cabana boy would make our little (almost) private beach perfect. Because it so nearly is perfect already. No high rise condos, no...

I haven't posted in a while because, frankly, there has been nothing to post! Since we returned from vacation, we have done just about nothing everyday. I must admit it has been very nice though. The guys have finished the downstairs bathroom remodel, and they will finish the upstairs this week. It is looking great! I can't wait to post pics. We were without our shower for a whole week though, so things were getting a little smelly around here! We took sponge baths and washed our hair in the kitchen sink. This weekend my sister and the kids are coming!!! I am soooooooo excited! I am putting her to work; she is going to help me pick out a shower curtain and rugs to match our "searching blue" Sherwin Williams paint. I think I like this one the best - from Kohls.
Thursday we take Cleo to a new dog care place called Dogtopia. It is really awesome ... and clean! Seriously, there was no dog smell at all! We just walked in unannounced and got a tour and loved it. They don't have kennel runs. It is indoor (w/ac) group play with other dogs the same size. The dogs are always supervised - and played with - by the workers. They have toys, slides, beds, and all kinds of stuff for them to play with/on. Also, they have a "dogcam" where we can view Cleo's playroom for any computer! I like that alot. We never like going anywhere over night unless we can take Cleo because we don't like the kennels around here, and neither does Cleo. But this place is great! They evaluate her on Thursday to get to know her (just that alone says something about the quality!), and then we are going to bring her in for a half day a few times to see how she likes it. We will probably do that at least once or twice a month, so when we do need to leave her, she will be used to it.
So that's what's going on in our lives... so interesting! LOL
Did I tell you my parents gave us a Wii for an early Xmas gift?!!!!!!! It has been a lot of fun. Roy has been playing his beloved Zelda on it while he can - summer school starts for him on the 13th. He knows he won't have time for fun then. Actually, he won't have time for fun until next May! I am praying this semester will be easier than the last. Only seeing your husband at his desk every night with books and a computer takes its toll. This summer has been great to just hang out with each other and be together.
Okay, so you know I am off the pill with hopes of getting pregnant in Aug/Sept, right? Well, I guess I have been really moody w/o those extra hormones - at least that's what Roy tells me. The other day he said I needed to start taking them again!!!! It was quite funny (though I didn't think so in the moment; I was frustrated w/him for about the third time in two days). I started thinking about it, and I am indeed moody. So I have been trying to work on that. I remember almost 12 years ago when I got on the pill that I was really moody for about 2mths. I thought it was becaue I was in college and planning my wedding at the same time, but I think the change in hormones affected it too. I guess now the reverse has the same affect! Poor Roy! Maybe it's good preparation for when I do get pregnant!
I start teaching summer school next week. I am excited to see my students; I really miss them. I spent five hours Monday night making one week's worth of lesson plans, schedules, and assignments, and it really got me excited (you have to be a teacher to understand that one, I guess.) Yesterday I was going to go to school, but we realized we had a flat tire! Roy put on the spare, and we got the tire changed. Thankfully I had purchased the warranty when we bought all the tires, so it cost us nothing, but I made up for that by spending $20 at Target while they were fixing the tire!
Jewelry making is going well still. I have posted several new pieces on the "sets" page, and I now have a "Shades of wood" section on the "earrings" page.. When my sister comes, we are going to have a jewelry making frenzy when the kids go to bed! I can't wait!
So that's what's going on in our lives... so interesting! LOL

Wow! SO impressed with the dogtopia place. So cool! Also, I really like the second necklace. Gorgeous. You are so creative! :) Glad you're looking forward to school! Oh, and the moodiness...yeah...it's worse with the pregnancy hormones. They are insane and change suddenly and drastically. Some days are fine and others are like WHAMMO! Seriously! This time has been the worst for me by far, and maybe it's because I'm feeling overwhelmed or whatever, but I really cried ALL DAY on Sunday because I'm stressing about being a good enough mom for 3 so yound. Cary was really sweet about it and surprised me with ice cream. It's been rough though... but then I'll have weeks and weeks that are awesome, so I guess hormones can swing you both ways. I just prefer the up side. ;)
Thanks so much, Deb! It really does mean the world to me!!
Hey there! So excited for you guys!!!(You being off the pill and everything.) I remember how excited I was just doing that part. Can't wait to see the blog that says we're pregnant!! Hormones, they are a funny thing. So impressed with your jewelry making! I'll have to keep you in mind when I need something unique!! Glad we found your blog!

Kirkwood Community College presents the final concerts in the Fall Performing Arts series, Dec. 7 Part I of Handel’s “Messiah.” Three Kirkwood faculty members and seven Kirkwood students will be showcased as soloists. A small professional orchestra of Kirkwood faculty members and area musicians will assist the Chorale’s 45 voices. While not belonging to Part I of “Messiah,” the evening’s performance will end with what has become a somewhat customary finish, the “Hallelujah Chorus,” from the end of Part II.
Saturday evening the Kirkwood Concert Band will perform selections in a wide variety of both European and American styles. Under the direction of Beth Zamzow, the concert opens with the “Star Spangled Banner,” then continues with pieces spanning musical eras from the baroque to the 20th century.
The night takes the audience into the holiday spirit with tunes “The Holly and the Ivy” and “Fum, Fum, Fum.” The concert concludes in true American style with “The Free Lance March,” by renowned American march composer John Philip Sousa..

It’s a nice perk if you can get it. And Gov. Terry Branstad doesn’t think Iowa legislators should get it much longer.
We’re talking full coverage of state health insurance premiums, which lawmakers now receive.
But the governor would like them to pay 20 percent of their premiums, just as he and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds started doing voluntarily last summer, and we think that would be a nice gesture to taxpayers.
Having state workers chip in on their health insurance premiums has become a point of contention with Branstad. He reiterated it again recently.
“We think it makes sense for the Legislature and others to do the same thing,” Branstad said of those paying part of their premiums. “I think it’s time they lead instead of follow.”
Cynics among us might argue there’s been darn little leadership out of lawmakers. But we won’t go that far. Plenty of work gets done under the golden dome; it just seems like major issues such as property tax relief, the gas tax increase and a few others always seem to stall and thus get the headlines.
We actually think we get a decent bang for our tax buck out of Des Moines. Now, we’d like to see some of those lawmakers’ bucks going to something many private-sector Iowans must contend with — health insurance premiums that grow every year.
Some may see a drawback in taking away this benefit. Maybe some highly qualified candidates wouldn’t want to run, for example.
We can’t imagine that stopping legislators we’re familiar with. They aren’t doing it to get rich (they are paid $25,000 annually with leadership posts paying more) but rather are sincerely interested in serving their constituents. Some would even call it being driven to serve.
Yet, reaction to Branstad’s call is mixed.
House Speaker Kraig Paulsen, R-Hiawatha, said he would support legislative branch officials and employees paying 20 percent of their health insurance premiums, saying “contributing to our health care is the right thing to do.” He noted House Republicans have supported the concept in the past and said the matter may be taken up by the Legislative Council between sessions of the Legislature.
On the other hand, Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal, D-Council Bluffs, said he doubted the Senate would consider the idea.
“We have always treated ourselves consistently with how we treated other state employees,” he said.
That’s regrettable, and we almost might think there’s some partisanship at work.
But whatever. We think it’s time for lawmakers to take a giant step forward into reality where, according to Branstad, Iowa is one of just six states not requiring all state workers to pay a share of their health insurance premiums. Federal employees, he noted, pay 25 percent and, of course, most private-sector workers share the costs with their employers.
The governor doesn’t believe Iowa will long be able to hold on to the “1970s-style plan where the employer pays everything.”
And we have to believe that he’s right in saying the public sides with him on this issue.
No offense to legislators. We just believe it’s fair for them to help cover the cost of their insurance, just like most other Iowans are doing. The next session would be a good time to start.

CONTRAVERSY!
A New Name, A New Track!!
Jasper and I decided that mymycrew would not fit any more for us, since we want to become professional djs and producers. It's just not grown-up enough and moreover mymycrew did not really have a meaning....
ContrAVersy does have a meaning: jasper is sort of introvert and then you have me who is extrovert. Contra= different, so this is where the idea came from. We are different in that perspective. but when you look at the way Jasper or I look at live and in manners we both think one should act we agree all the way. That's why we are such a good team.

Wilberforce and goofing off
One evidence of without an attempt to show him in the midst of his loving family and friends. His had always been a curiously disorganized household. Robert Southey, the poet, tells of a visit to Keswick in 1818. ‘Wilbeforce has been here with all his household, and such a household! The principle of the family seems to be that, provided the servants have faith, good works are not to be expected from them, and the utter disorder which prevails in consequence is truly farcical. . . . I have seen nothing in such pell mell topsy turvy chaotic confusion as Wilberforce’s apartments. His wife sits in the midst of it like patience on a monument, and he frisks about as if every vein in his body were filled with quicksilver; but with all, there is such a constant hilarity in every look and motion, such a sweetness in all his tones, such a benignity in all his thoughts, words and actions, that . . . you can feel nothing but love and admiration for a creature of so happy and blessed a nature.’”
Patrick Cormack, Wilberforce: The Nation’s Conscience (Basingstoke, 1983), pages 108-109.

The appearance of this anthology assessing the significance of Martyn Lloyd-Jones (hereafter MLJ) is to be warmly welcomed, not because the outlines of the life of this venerable preacher (1899-1981) have previously gone unexplored (indeed the impressive introduction evaluates four previous attempts), but because this is the first attempt to assess the man's career in a way properly characterized as multi-perspectival.
Eleven contributors, many of them distinguished researchers in their own right, met at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, in December 2010 to assess the career and influence of MLJ, longtime minister of Westminster Chapel, London. At the distance of thirty years from the eminent preacher's death, there is both advantage and disadvantage in making fresh assessment. As for the former, there has been much settling of the dust of the controversies in which MLJ found himself embroiled after 1960; the passage of time can have made the needed work of reassessment only easier. But as to the latter, the passage of thirty years means that a whole fresh generation of evangelicals has reached mid-life with little or no knowledge of MLJ. This means that the contributors to the anthology have their work cut out for them in reestablishing the significance of this evangelical leader.
Among the weighty questions taken up in the 2010 conference were those of MLJ's place in the twentieth-century resurgence of Calvinism (ch. 1). D.W. Bebbington concludes that MLJ was propelled by a Reformed resurgence already underway in the 1930s. We are helped by David Ceri Jones to see that MLJ's being Welsh by birth and earlier pastoral experience, yet positioned in the heart of London from 1939 onward, cast him as something of an 'outsider' standing near the center of English Christianity (ch. 2). The skillful writing of Ian Randall (ch. 3) depicts MLJ-who had been enamored with the eighteenth-century evangelical revival-consumed with preaching and praying for national revival in the somber 1950s, a time of national retrenchment. MLJ was not the only evangelical leader sounding the trumpet this way; yet he with others did not live to see his aspirations fulfilled.
The fourth chapter, by William Kay, is particularly striking. It addresses both the question of MLJ's relations with various expressions of Pentecostalism, with which he shared a belief in a second work of grace in the believer (while disagreeing over what that work entailed), and the corollary of how the conservative Reformed constituency that had looked to MLJ for leadership fractured over their leader's ambivalence on such questions. This chapter, taken in combination with that of Bebbington (above) requires that readers reassess the conventional wisdom that MLJ was nothing if not the great Calvinist standard-bearer of his time. MLJ's affinity with Pentecostalism was, to a considerable degree, an expression of his dismay with what he took to be conservative Calvinist rigidity.
Two persons closely associated with one expression of the MLJ legacy, the London Theological Seminary (founded in 1977), explore the preacher's ideas about theological education and about twentieth-century theology in general. Though MLJ had trained and worked as a medical doctor of considerable distinction, his own ideas about theological education were highly ambivalent. Theologically self-trained, he seemed to harbor an aversion to the formal academic study of theology (at least on the university model) out of fear that the secularization underway in public universities was undermining theological education conducted in conjunction with them. He initially supported and eventually withdrew his support from the London Bible College (founded in1946), now London School of Theology, and from 1977 threw his weight behind the new, less-pretentious school. Philip Eveson, long-time principal of London Theological Seminary, explores MLJ's sometimes-conflicted views on this subject. One finds that MLJ would have been willing to be nominated to be the principal of a Welsh theological college in 1938! Robert Strivens, current principal of London Theological Seminary, on the other hand, demonstrates MLJ's quite extensive personal reading of the works of Karl Barth. There is complexity here that resists easy categorization.
Coeditor Andrew Atherstone offers the single best account known to this reviewer of the public confrontation of 1966 involving MLJ with the equally prominent John Stott (ch. 10). The context was that of a surging ecumenical movement, with evangelical congregations and ministers within doctrinally comprehensive denominations feeling quite unprovided for as union talks proceeded apace. MLJ, having accepted the invitation of the umbrella-like Evangelical Alliance to address that current bewildering situation, took the opportunity to advocate the coming together of Britain's evangelicals who were now scattered across and within various denominations. Atherstone, while allowing that the MLJ appeal was lacking in clarity, considerably advances our understanding of this key episode by his explaining that Anglican evangelicals were seceding from their denomination in considerable numbers at this time, quite apart from the sentiments of MLJ. The intervention of John Stott, immediately on the heels of the MLJ address (an intervention for which Stott later apologized) was, on this explanation, his attempt to staunch an exodus already underway (as well as what might yet be encouraged by MLJ's exhortation).
Of similar sterling quality is the eleventh chapter, provided by Puritan scholar John Coffey, regarding MLJ's love of church history and especially Puritan history. This is not the esoteric inquiry one might imagine. MLJ was, after all, as responsible as any evangelical in the period since 1950 for the marshaling of the opinions of the sixteenth-century Reformers and the Puritans of the subsequent century on contemporary theological and ecclesiastical questions. Coffey's concern is to observe that MLJ's use of history was not characterized by any particular rigor. While MLJ left evidence of having digested some twentieth-century analyses of his favorite epochs of church history, the overwhelming impression gained is that MLJ's appeals to history were too harnessed to his polemical concerns. Coffey also observes that the Puritan publishing program, so energetically advanced by the Banner of Truth (of which MLJ was a principal backer) was, in effect, a program that put into circulation the "canon" of Puritans favored by MLJ.
Taken all in all, this excellent volume is a demonstration of how much the study of church history gains when it is "re-complexified." Virtually every contributor to the anthology communicates deep respect for the memory and leadership of MLJ and shows that such reverence is compatible with serious efforts to untangle and reinterpret the contested legacy of a great Christian leader. If there is a caveat to be raised, it would simply be that the volume devotes no segment to exploring the legacy of MLJ outside the UK. When one considers that MLJ discovered the writings of B.B. Warfield in Toronto, was first observed by the man he would succeed in London (G. Campbell Morgan) while preaching in Philadelphia, came to the attention of post-war evangelicals outside the UK by a preaching series at Wheaton, delivered his lectures on homiletics (later published as Preaching and Preachers) in Philadelphia, and whose ministry was emulated by the erection of "Westminster Chapels" in cities all over North America, we can acknowledge that the influence of this Christian leader was far wider even than this excellent volume suggests.

What lies across the Water- Why History, International Law and American Values matter in the case of the Cuban five
The following text is my presentation at the panel organized by Wayne Smith about the book "What lies across the Water", at the Center for International Policy, April 18, Washington DC.
I want to thank Dr. Wayne Smith and the Center for International Policy (CIP) for the invitation to discuss the book “What lies across the Water”. As a Cuban-American who thinks constantly about the difficult relations between Cuba and the United States, it is an honor to be part of the effort of the CIP to improve the knowledge about the complex history of these links and the need to approach them with creativity and goodwill.
Whatever you might think about the Cuban Five, if you want to know how their case fits into the history of relations between Cuba and the United States, you must read this book. The author Stephen Kimber presents a well written short narrative about how the Cuban five ended up in US prisons. The book reads more as reportage for the general public than as an academic report. The author has studied the long history of conflict between Cuba and the United States and the use of terror as a political weapon by Cuban right wing groups in Florida.
Terrorist on the Dais at University of Miami's ICCAS
This morning, a congressional staffer forwarded the latest "Cuba Facts" received from the University of Miami's Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies (ICCAS). The Institute regularly produces briefing papers and shares them with interested colleagues in the academic and policy community, and, of course, with staff on Capitol Hill. The Institute isn't afraid to take a policy position when it comes to Cuba and U.S. sanctions, or - in this blogger's opinion - to sacrifice an honest representation of the facts in order to convey a particular point of view. (And, let's not forget that until this year, the University of Miami's ICCAS received millions in taxpayer-funded support from USAID.)
But the latest Cuba Facts memo isn't what interests me. I'm more stunned by the quaint little event the Institute hosted last week to celebrate the "50th Anniversary of the Guerilla Struggle Against Totalitarianism." But what does it meant to honor the "guerrilla struggle" anyway? Perhaps taking a look at the honorees might give us a clue?
Twitter, Terrorism and Tightropes Over Cuba
Where’s a good ombudsman when you need one? Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve received comments from readers on two very sensitive topics that remind me just how hard it is to find middle ground when it comes to Cuba.
Two days ago, a contributor for THN passed on what seemed - to him - plausible news. A group of Cuban bloggers, especially prominent abroad for their criticism of their government and prolific use of social media, were unable to send their 140 character messages to Twitter. One of them, the much-admired and maligned Yoani Sanchez, made instant headlines for publicly wondering if the Cuban government had blocked their access. After all, her blog is blocked in Cuba, so maybe it wasn’t a leap too far?
“Bloquearon la publicacion desde moviles cubanos a twitter. Parece que pusieron el filtro aqui dentro.1 amigo publica por mi este tweet”
Sanchez then went on to wonder – via friends to whom she dictated her tweets – whether Twitter had been the one to block access. That too had (an even more) plausible precedent. In May 2009, to avoid getting in trouble with U.S. authorities, Microsoft blocked access to its instant messaging software for countries subject to U.S. sanctions, including Cuba. And that, observed Sarah Stephens of the Center for Democracy in the Americas, was, ironically, just weeks after the Obama administration announced it would issue new regulations to increase telecommunications access for the Cuban people.
As it turned out, nobody was censoring anybody. Tomas Bilbao, who originally posted Sanchez' s concerns, did some investigating. And, as he reported here yesterday, Twitter simply made a change to how customers must dial in. That broke the Twitter link to which Yoani Sanchez and others in Cuban had become accustomed. Bilbao admitted that he jumped the gun without all the facts in hand, and I hope that Sanchez will do the same. If she doesn’t, she’ll only prove her critics right, who accuse her of being more interested in building the momentum her creativity and criticism have won her, than in building a constructive dialogue. And that’s where the real damage is done. Unfortunately, both sides are too quick to judge, take names and call the press.

Christine Todd Whitman is “delighted” that some Republicans are abandoning Grover Norquist.
She’s tough on Republicans who bashed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for praising President Obama.
In a wide-ranging interview with The Hill, the former two-term governor who later led the Environmental Protection Agency from 2001-2003 reflected on her party and busy post-politics career.
“The things I have always loved about government and politics is it is hard to get bored because you can be all over the place, all sorts of different areas, and I like going up the learning curve,” Whitman said in late November. “That’s what keeps me going.”
Whitman wears many hats today — she’s active on energy, security and healthcare policy, and much more.
She is president of the Whitman Strategy Group, which helps companies and groups navigate environmental rules and boost sustainability — and not just in the U.S. Whitman advised on a major sustainable-city project in Korea.
Whitman also travels around the U.S. as co-chairwoman of the Clean and Safe Energy (CASE) Coalition, which seeks to build public support for construction of new nuclear power plants.
A few more of Whitman’s many affiliations: She is on the boards of the American Security Project, the Corporate Eco Forum, the Aspen Institute’s Health Stewardship Project, the Council on Foreign Relations and companies including Texas Instruments Inc.
It’s not all work, however. Whitman is happy she gets to spend time with her five grandchildren.
“The balance in life is nice,” she said.
Balance is something that for years Whitman has called missing in the GOP.
Her 2005 book, It’s My Party Too, lamented a party controlled by “extreme conservatives” on reproductive rights, the environment, gun control, taxes and more.
The book’s subtitle: “The Battle for the Heart of the GOP and the Future of America.”
For years, it’s a battle Whitman and other centrists have fought from a defensive stance.
Republican centrists are increasingly rare in Congress amid the Tea Party ascendancy, the GOP-controlled House that has sought to dismantle environmental protections and, until recently, the party has shown a steadfast resistance to higher tax revenues in fiscal policy showdowns.
But Whitman, who is now in her mid-60s, sees signs of a turning tide.
“I am delighted to see now that, for instance, you have some of the leaders here saying, ‘Forget the pledge,’ ” Whitman said, referring to no-tax-increases pledge maintained by anti-tax crusader Norquist that most Republican lawmakers have signed.
Whitman is quick to point out her tax-cutting record as New Jersey governor and says federal spending is “out of control.” But she says tax revenues must be in the mix, too, in fiscal policy talks.
“I think it is a very good sign. People are finally saying, ‘We are going to have to negotiate,’ ” she said of some Republicans’ recent willingness to break the pledge. “It is pretty tough to negotiate when you are not willing to give up anything, when you can’t talk about what clearly needs to be part of the discussion.
“It does not mean you embrace taxes as the way to solve the problem. It just means you allow yourself some room for discussion of closing loopholes and that sort of thing,” Whitman said.
More broadly, Whitman said Romney’s loss among women, Latinos and African-Americans and young voters shows a party that needs to change.
“Unless you are living in a different world, you don’t see much of a future for the Republican Party. You cannot rely on 60-plus-year-old white men. It is not enough to win a general election,” she said.
Whitman sees disconnect between public sentiment and the political establishment, arguing that there’s dissatisfaction with both parties right now among a public hungry for discussion and leadership.
Whitman finds evidence of this disconnect in her home state. She took notice when Christie drew attacks from GOP insiders for praising Obama’s handling of Hurricane Sandy — which devastated the New Jersey coast — just days before the election.
“You had … the pundits here [in Washington, D.C.] and the talking heads within the party damning him. But the people in New Jersey, and the people you talk to around the country, they said, ‘That’s what we need,’ ” Whitman said.
“They didn’t see this as a repudiation of the Republican Party. They saw it as an executive doing what they elected him to do, which was govern the state and try and get it through a crisis,” she said.
While she isn’t claiming victory, Whitman sees a party ready to move back in her direction.
“There are some people who will never, ever accept moderation,” Whitman said, but adds that increasing numbers of Republicans are “starting to make the moves that give themselves the ability to reach consensus.”
Whitman is now calling for a more centrist GOP as a private citizen, but she also has battled in closer quarters.
She was to the left of the George W. Bush White House during her 2001-2003 stint as EPA administrator, notably backing limits on carbon dioxide, only to see Bush walk back his pledge on the matter.
On Capitol Hill in recent years, Republicans have blocked proposals for greenhouse gas limits and are seeking to scuttle EPA climate regulations.
But Whitman says the public is ready for more action on climate change. “If you get out of Washington, in the real world out there, people get it,”.

Supermodel Rose Huntington-Whiteley looks beyond fabulous in her white sexy white cut-out Max Mara dress. The open back detail sends chills down my spine!
She completed her look with nude and metallic Sergio Rossi heels.
I am not crazy about her hair either. I just feel it needed to be a little more polished.
I am just delighted that her weave looks half way decent.

Milocrorze: A Love Story by Yoshimasa Ishibashi
There dwells a lov’d one,
But cruel is she!
She left lonely forever
The kings of the sea.
the distance between worlds
He tries not to think. When he thinks, he remembers, and he doesn’t want to remember. He wonders if she does the same thing. He knows she doesn’t. He thinks that things are getting better now. He has always wished for her absence, and now he has it and things are just fine. He’s fine. He wishes she could see just how fine he is, how relieved at the fact that she’s gone. He wonders, though, why he has to keep telling himself that every day. Maybe, but no. Everything is all right. He’s okay.
___
“Are you okay?” she asked, looking at him curiously. There was a strange intense expression on her face as she studied him. It made him uncomfortable.
“I’m always okay,” he replied lightly.
“Really?” she raised an eyebrow at him skeptically. “Then how come I get this feeling like you’re pissed off or something? You look like, I don’t know, like you’re upset with me, I think.”
“I don’t have any reason to be upset with you,” he told her.
She still looked doubtful, but she nodded. “Okay. So we’re fine?”
“Of course.” He wouldn’t meet her eyes, though.
Finally, she looked away from him. “Okay.”
___
He likes to pretend that he never knew her, that she never existed at all. So he turns a deaf ear when other people talk about her. He feels glad when he hears them say things about her that aren’t exactly flattering. He wants to tell them that he completely agrees, that she’s an insane bitch and they’re all better off without her in their lives. But he has noticed to his annoyance that whenever someone talks about her, no matter how hard he tries to ignore it, he listens anyway. He wants to know how she’s doing, wherever she’s gone. He wants her to be okay.
___
“What the hell did I ever do to you?” She was so furious that he could see she was practically shaking with the effort to keep some semblance of calm. “Why does it seem like you’re trying to deliberately piss me off?”
He knew it would push her over the edge, but he chose to say the words anyway. “So, it’s working?”
For the first time that he could remember, she was rendered speechless. He walked away knowing that he had won their battle. It served her right for thinking that she could manipulate him into doing what she wanted.
After that encounter, she was the one who tried to reach out to him, the one who tried to act like they were friends. It always gave him a perverse sense of pleasure whenever he could show her that he didn’t want her to be his friend. She pretended that it wasn’t a big deal to her, but he knew that it hurt her every time he ignored her. He was glad that he could hurt her.
___
He doesn’t ever want to see her again. He wants her to be completely gone. So he’s not exactly sure why he keeps looking into the faces of people he passes by on the street, half expecting that maybe it would be her. But, of course, it’s never her. And of course he’s glad. Now he just has to keep repeating that to himself until he begins to believe that it’s true. It has to be true. He doesn’t want to think about what it could possibly mean if it isn’t true.
___
“You ever think about parallel universes?” she asked him once.
He was a bit taken aback by the question. Just a few seconds ago, they were talking about cartoons, and then this abrupt change in their conversation happened. He found it amusing. She was so unpredictable sometimes. “What about parallel universes?” he replied to humor her. He wanted to hear what she was going to say next.
“Well, people say that there are many universes that exist at the same time in the same space, but like on different wavelengths or different dimensions. So, for example,” she suddenly took his hand and placed it palm to palm against hers. He was startled by the unexpected contact, but he allowed it. In fact, he had this curious feeling that he wanted their hands to stay linked like that for a long time, maybe forever. She looked into his eyes then. “So, we could actually live in different universes and hold out our hands like this, and we would never even know that we were together because of the distance between our worlds.”
“That would be weird,” he said, “that we would be so close together without even knowing it.”
She smiled. “You know what’s even weirder?” Her voice had dropped to a whisper, like she was telling him a secret.
“What?” All he could see were her eyes.
“Though we live in different worlds, our worlds exist in the same space. So the distance between worlds,” her hand closed around his hand, “is really no distance, at all.”
___
He sees her one day across the street. For a moment, they just stare at each other. Then she turns away and disappears into the crowd. She never once looks back at him. He turns away, too. They never see each other again.

We made some home made finger paint today and had great fun with our little group of Mums and tots with babies as young as 6 months getting involved in the action! It’s totally edible (though not that delicious!) and completely non-toxic, and the best part is it was so easy to make and will last!
This is the recipe ( I googled a few, found the common denominator and went from there):
* 2 cups of corn flour (corn starch in the US I think)
* 1 cup of cold water
* 4.5 cups of boiling water
* Liquid food colouring
Method:
Mix the cornflour with the cold water and stir together. Pour in the boiling water and stir between each cup. It goes really strange (you are basically mixing a hot oobleck goop) but keep stirring and it literally seems to “melt” into a wonderful, custard-like consistency. We then separated it into individual jam jars before adding colouring, but you can do it however you like and this is the stage to add colour.
Edited to add:
Some people have found that the paint remains liquid and doesn’t thicken up as it should. I have no idea why this should be, but I have two possible solutions, based on the fabulous commenters below!
1. Try simply adding up to 1 more cup of cornflour/ cornstarch and see if that helps to thicken it.
2. Try mixing the paint in a pan on a medium heat instead of just in a bowl, as that will help to bring it together.
It’s always frustrating posting recipes that work brilliantly when you try them yourself, but for some reason don’t work for everyone! I can only assume it’s down to slight change in ingredients used and perhaps how the directions are followed. Do try it as it is LOVELY stuff! Thanks
C helped me to spoon this into the jars and she absolutely LOVED every minute of the whole process!
I added a squeeze of colouring to each jar and then between us we mixed them up.
During mixing they looked fabulous!
And the finished paints look like a little work of art Almost too good to paint with…but not quite.
All lined up and ready for action. I put in some thick paint brushes for the toddlers but expected babies to use their fingers. They seemed to understand that perfectly
Baby Boy is 6 months and this was his first little painting. We weren’t sure how impressed he was!
Kiddies getting stuck in and a couple more crawling on the floor, waiting for their turns!
That’s more like it baby Boy, get those fingers in and give it a good squish!
J having a whale of a time!
Big boy N knows how to paint properly!
Someone got a tad possessive of all “her” paints. “Dey Mines!”
And then we introduced edible finger paint number 2! Chocolate and strawberry Angel Delight pudding mixes (although these were actually a Sainsbury’s Basics range for 7p each!) We just mixed the powder with milk and whisked it until lovely and thick, then put it on the table for them to touch and add to their paintings. There was no added food colouring, but lovely brown, chocolatey messiness everywhere nonetheless
Baby J was very interested in the chocolate pudding goo! Who can blame him?!
It’s important to use ALL of the senses when exploring! Yum yum!
And C did a little bit of mark-making with a fork through the lovely, thick, gloopy mess.
Little Pop found the brush very tasty and had her fair share of pudding paint too.
This activity is good for:
* involving all ages of children
* creativty and expression
* using fingers and tools to do mark-making
* exploring the senses and discovering new textures
* knowledge and understanding of the world: following a recipe, mixing and stirring, combining materials and mixing colours
* gross and fine motor skills (mixing the colours into the paint was hard work!)
We have another home made paint recipe to share tomorrow! Enjoy messy, creative, fun!
Great messy fun! Love the fact that u dont need to worry about it going in their mouths too.Adele x
Love it! A great (outdoor?) birthday party activity idea!
What is cornflour to you? Is it ground corn, which we in the states call corn meal? Or corn starch? I think you mean corn starch, which is a little different. Is it a very powdery white substance with a gritty feel?
The recipe I’m reading calls for corn starch and that would produce the consistency, look, and feeling described in this activity. Corn starch has a powdery thick feeling not gritty.
Hi Anon! I think it is corn starch although on Googling it it seems they are slightly different. But both work as a thickening agent so I’m guessing the starch will work in exactly the same way. Our corn flour has the exact appearance of ordinary flour. Hope it works and I’m sure it will!
How fun! I have been looking for something to do with my 2 year old while my 4 year old is at school! Thanks for the idea!
What great fun! I will definitely give it a go! Love all the pics too! Kerri
Anonymous, cornflour is cornmeal in the US.
Anna, those paints look delicious! What lovely bright colours and I can see from the photos what a fab consistency they were. How great for the babies to get stuck in with the older kids. Katy is often muscling in on Max’s play, and she isn’t always welcome! This is a nice idea for encouraging Max to include his sis.
Nooooo, cornmeal is polenta! Cornflour is the same as cornstarch.
Hope you make some Sarah! It’s great for messy play
The words vary a lot by region. In Australia the cornflour sold in supermarkets can be made of wheat or corn. When it is made of corn it is the equivalent of what US recipes call corn starch.
Usually you have to look at the ingredients to know if it is wheat or corn based cornflour. I think this might go some way to explaining why the recipe works for some and not others, they may actually be using a different product. I think the wheat cornflour needs a bit more heating before it thickens up.
I did love doing this activity it was great fun. However, how long do you feel you should stay on this activity for the only reason I ask is because my daughter appears to have a short concentration span is this normal for one year olds? your daughter looked like she would be happy doing this all day.
Hi Bella! Thanks for your comment and I’m glad she enjoyed it. `i would say that a 1-2 year old has a very short attention span and probably will only want to do things for 5-10 minutes at the most. But they tend to like to come back to the same activity and repeat it over and over. As adults we find this frustrating but it’s how they learn! My girl is 2 and a half and is more interested in some things than others. She could probably paint/ stick/ play with play dough for well over half an hour, but that’s only a recent development and she tends to flit between things to try them out.
Exactly what I needed for my 7 m/o nephew, thanks!Found via
Oh my oh my!! How fun!!! Looks just perfect for the little ones! Clever idea!
Maggy(thanks for linking up to Kids Get Crafty)
oh we can go through the finger paint. How fun that I can make some new paint with stuff I have in my cabinets. Thanks for the recipe!
Yummy! ha ha… what a Fab idea!
I’d love to have you share at my For the Kids Friday Link Party! I’m sure you’ll find some fun ideas while you are there! Come join the fun!
What a GREAT idea! I have been letting my 17 month old paint lately and he ALWAYS wants to eat it – I will be trying this out today! Thanks for the wonderful idea!!
I just can’t get over the pics. To cute!
Thanks so much for sharing this at For the Kids Friday at Sun Scholars!

How long will this last?
Hello “Anon” I think out of the fridge no more than a couple of days. In the fridge maybe a week at a guess? I think ours was best the day we made it, and it was best at being a sensory play material rather than long-lasting paint. Lots of fun though!
Cute Idea! I repinned it on pintrest.
I love this! all those cute chubby hands in the squishy paint is too cute! I am going to do this with my 2 year old soon!
hello! thanks for the post. i’d need some follow-up, finally could you store it in the fridge? and for how long?
sorry, i didn’t make it through with the comments.. now i see, you already answered to the same question
No problem at all! Ours didn’t keep very long in the end. Maybe only a day or two? Use it up with lots of messy play!
wow great idea thank you my grandchildren will love this and very welcome as half term is coming up … happy crafting and love sandy xx
Great idea, do you think the food colouring stains? i’m thinking in the bath or on the kitchen floor… thx
I love this idea. I really want to try finger painting with my 13 month old and this recipe sounds great. Any as ConsciousMama asked, does it stain? He doesn’t really have any “grungy” clothes so I’m a little worried about the food colouring dying his clothes? Has anyone found out if it stains yet?
I tried making this, following the directions exactly, but for some reason the consistency was pure liquid…I tried adding more corn starch, but that didn’t help. Suggestions? Thanks so much!
Hi Lauren, that is really weird! You did use hot water right? It should thicken just like it would if you added the cornflour to stock to thicken it for gravy or to a stew to thicken it.
Mine was the same, just zap it in the microwave for 30-40 secs and give it a good stir before it becomes a big lump!
We tried this today with our mothers group of 8 month olds. It was a moderate success, but still a little too advanced. My little boy did enjoy eating it and throwing it however! )
Lauren – mine was liquid until about 2 mins of stirring and then it turned thick and custard like all of a sudden. I thought I had stuffed up but then it turned.
The food colouring did stain – skin, clothing everything! – but we thought this would be the case and had all the bubs in disposable nappies and naked – it is summer here in Australia!
Storage: I made it last night and stored in the fridge overnight. It went solid overnight but all I needed to do was add a little more boiling water and give it a good stir and it went back again. It wasn’t as good as the fresh stuff however. I would advise making this the same day as you need it and not storing it.
Lauren I’m sorry to hear that! I don’t know what to say as ours was so waxy and custard-like. If anything I’d have thought people may find it to thick, not too thin Perhaps follow Stephanie’s (great!) advice and try stirring it for longer? It feels like you are mixing up goop, but with hot water. AS your stir it begins to get more and more thick. Were you using a flour like substance ? Corn starch? Over here it is Corn flour but in the US it;s cornstarch? Sorry not to help more!
I used a cup less boiling water and a cup more corn starch (or there about) and it was perfect. I know it’s no longer edible, but to color it I used the ends of my tubes of crayola finger paint. I had just a little left of each color. No staining and way cheaper!! Great idea.
Brilliant and well done for making it work!
Thank you for this! Mine turned out a bit on te runny side, so I just shook a bit more cornflour into it, it got thicker as it cooled too. I made a stencil with a dozen little Christmas trees on it, coloured the paint a darkish green, and stirred in some gold edible lustre dust to give it a sheen… Paint smeared over the stencil onto card underneath, and my baby girlhas made her first Christmas cards! Thank you for showing me that messy is doable with a baby!
that sounds SO wonderful!!
My solution to a runny mixture was to cook it on the stove for a few minutes, just like custard
perfect solution!

Thanks for the great post!I made this just now. It was briljant! Allthough it was less silky than yours. I used a cup more corn flour and it was perfect! Our 12 month old was particularly keen on eating it.. So we ended up with a blueish, cyanotic lipped boy;)
Oops!! But glad it worked out well!
Mr 1 loved this goopy paint. We only used one cup cornflour, one cup cold water, then just added boiling water and whisked until it seemed a good consistency. We used food colouring for some colours, cocoa for brown, and a few drops of non-toxic acrylic paint for others. Looked like a ridiculous amount for one boy, but he used it all up smearing on paper, cardboard, himself…… Very cheap entertainment.
So glad it worked out for you and very good ideas for the other colourings!
This is a really great idea!
We’ll have to try this recipe next. We just posted about fingerpainting with banana pudding. My little ones loved it! us out! I linked your website on our blog since we tried out one of your finger paint recipes! Thank you for the fun idea -lifeasawife
thank you!
I did some yoghurt finger paiting and linked to this post as I mentioned your recipe, thanks
Thanks Elsie!
I just tried this and it’s pure liquid I followed the instructions exactly and even used less water…darn!!
darn it indeed!! so frustrating. Sorry. Did you cook it for longer to see if it would come together?
I started making this by following the exact recipe but by the 2nd cup of boiling water it was pure liquid so I stopped the water, added more corn starch and some flour until thicker and then let it cool in the fridge for a couple hours. Then added more flour to thicken. Still wasn’t custardy all the way through but was thick enough to paint and my 7month old LOVED the feel of the cool mushy paint. She cried when I tried to end the activity so I let her paint her high chair tray for awhile too. It all washed off (no stains) and she had a blast!! Thanks for posting this recipe!! Loved seeing your pictures too!
Glad you were able to adapt it to make it work! This is the one recipe that people have had to do that with the most. I think cornstarch/ cornflour is partly to blame! (but wish i could work out why!)
yeah this stuff leaves stains on everything it want come off!!!
Oh no! Very sorry to hear it. Too much colouring? That didn’t happen to us at all, so sorry!
This may be my all time favorite paint to use with the kids. Super easy to make. It’s edible (and non-toxic). A great tactile experience. By far the easiest paint project to clean up on the boys and everything else. The boys played with this stuff forever. Will be making this a lot!
I didn’t read through all of the comments so this may have been asked already. Does the food dye not stain their hands?
What a fabulous website with great ideas. Going to try this one today!
We made edible finger paint using plain yogurt for our 14-month old. Worked really well:
I never thought of involving babies to paint! I think I will add some food coloring to my 6 mo. old’s rice cereal and let her go to town!!!
Can you all share what type of paper you used with the paints? I am so excited to try this with my 9 mo old, who LOVES touching everything!

Hi, I just tried this awesome ricipe out with my 1yr old daughter. She spent most of the time with her fingers in her mouth and was able to explore the wonderful world of colour without me worrying about poisonous substances Thank you!
Oh, I have answered the staining and cleaning up issues – She was wearing a disposable nappy (as mentioned above) And I used an old inflatable pool sans water as the painting area. Clean up was a breeze!
I’ve made this twice now. The first time it worked perfectly. The second time it didn’t. I don’t know if it made the difference or not, but when I made it this time I mixed the cornstarch into the cold water instead of the water into the cornstarch. I just cooked it for a bit on the stove and it thickened after a few minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!
I’ve made this before and my son loved it, but I was just wondering how long the paints last in closed jars before they start growing stuff?
I wondered how to store it too?!?
I sealed the jars & put it in the pantry & within a week it absolutely stank I was so disappointed! The batch made more than I needed, so the uncoloured batch I had kept in the fridge, & that’s find weeks later!
I’ve just made this and the recipe worked a treat! Although, instead of stirring lots I left it for a few minutes then started stirring and it became gloopy and custard-like. Love the recipe, thank you so much! We’re going to have fund tomorrow
wow this looks fab, and it does actually look tasty even if its not, lol
Corn flour and corn starch are not the same. Corn flour is milled from the whole kernel, while cornstarch is obtained from the endosperm portion of the kernel. Corn starch is just that – starch. It is chemically separated from the protein and other components of corn flour.
The confusion stems in that they can SOMETIMES be used interchangeably, such as in soups and stews as a thickening agent. However, for bread baking and deep frying, you cannot substitute corn starch for corn flour.
Corn flour is available in the US, but it is typically located with the other specialty grains. My local grocery store carries it in Bob’s Red Mill brand.
That being said, when I decided to attempt this “recipe,” I didn’t have any corn flour handy. However, as I am located in the southwest US, I did have masa harina, a flour made from lime soaked corn, which is most commonly used to make tortillas. So, I decided to try using it instead. While I cannot comment on substituting corn starch or US corn flour, I can attest that the masa harina worked.
My 12 month old daughter wasn’t initially impressed by this project, but, with a little encouragement, she quickly became thrilled. I’ve already made it three times this week! It seems to entertain her in about 30 minute bursts.
Thank you for providing such a great “recipe” I’ve tried multiple versions of edible finger paint and have found this version to be the best yet. The finished product had a nice, slightly thick, consistency. I have since recommended it to all of my friends with children who still taste everything.
I almost forgot to mention…it did stain her skin in a few spots, but it was easily removed with a little soap and some unappreciated scrubbing.
Good luck to everyone else!
I made this for my 14 month daughter as her first experience with paint. She had a great time. Thank you
If it helps anyone, a cup in the UK is actually slightly less than a cup in the US. That may have affected how some of the batches turned out for people. ) Thank you for posting. I’m trying it with my 7 month old today!
I made this today for my 18 month old twins and they loved it. I cooked it in the microwave for a couple of minutes after I’d put the hot water in – no different to making custard really!! Think I might add some glitter next time too I’ve linked you up in my blog post about it too, if that’s ok!
My kids loved this!! Although mine was very watery :S but it was still fun gloop! My 5 month old and 2 1/2 yr old loved it!! ( especially sliding with his feet ) thank you!!
Did this with my 10 month old today and had a blast!
the consistency of mine was great, even better after I cooked it for a couple of minutes. My 4.5yo sensory seeker and 2.5yo had a ball! I gave them an assortment of edible sprinkles to throw in, along with chopped up apples, sultana’s and dried paw paw. My 2yo thought this was fantastic and everything went straight in the mouth. The older one knew best, despite me telling him this was special paint he could eat, he said ‘I’m worried mummy, you shouldn’t eat paint!’ Will definitely do this again! I used the food colouring sparingly and only had a little staining on their hands, sure it will be gone after bath time
What an amazingly simple yet awesome idea!! I just made a whole batch and they turned out GREAT. I’m waiting for the little one to wake up so I can try this out! I think I might add a bit of flavoring to the dyes next time! (vanilla, orange zest etc!). Thanks for sharing!
Note to anyone making this – put it in the fridge! I left mine out and opened it 4 days later and boy did it stink!!
Saw this on Pinterest and tried it out. It didn’t work that well. I think my water was not hot enough. After i put it on the stove and stired it, it was getting better. And I had to add tons of food colouring. I think I am going to try it again Anyway, if it doesn’t work again I will put it on the stove again. Doesn’t matter
I tried this today with my 7mo and it was fabulous. I did use corn starch instead of corn flour (they are similar, but definitely not the same thing), so mine turned out a little more translucent. Next time I might try adding a little flour or more dye to turn out deeper colours. After reading all the comments I went straight to mixing it on medium heat on the stove, which worked beautifully. I don’t know how the original instructions with the boiling water would have turned out, but I definitely had success on the stove. The mixture gelled together in less than 2 minutes, though I had to stir it constantly.
Thanks, Anna, for this wonderful site! I have 1 baby so far (only a small bit older than Baby Bean), so I can’t use everything on here yet, but I love all the ideas. Things that I can’t try yet I’m filing away in my brain for later!!! I’m ALL about sensory play for my 7mo right now. I want him to play in the dirt, splash in water, taste everything that’s non-toxic, and generally explore the world as much as possible! I am having so much fun already, introducing the world to him and letting him make discoveries. And he’s young – I know there is so much more ahead of us!
I did this last night and it never thickened. I live in the US and think that you might have meant oz instead of cups? Because I added 2 additional cups of corn starch to the mixture and it still didn’t thicken. It got to a milky consistency so I had the kids use it anyway and it stained them from head to toe lol. It was a mess!
I haven’t tried this yet, but I wonder if it is the different size of UK “cups” vs. US “cups” is causing the inconsistent results. My husband is Australian and they have their own size “cups” as well. I have had many many many recipes turn out poorly because the ratio of dry to liquid isn’t the same. I’m going to try making paint this afternoon and see how it goes!
Last time I checked babies 6 months old shouldn’t have corn starch and why you would want them to have food coloring which is linked to cancer starting out, is beyond my level of comprehension….Parents, if you are using food dyes go all natural, regular food dyes are not good for babies or toddlers.
Last time I checked the article was not suggesting that you feed this to your baby as food. Get a grip. The obvious interpretation of the activity and resources prepared here is that, although this is not food, if it gets in your baby’s mouth it isn’t going to harm them. Small quantities of corn starch or food colourings are unlikely to do any lasting harm when used on an occasional basis. Also, you are clearly guilty of a typical America-centric assumption here, perhaps being aware that there is a world outside the US is beyond your comprehension too (I’m assuming by your spelling and your choice of CBS as your news source that you are probably from the US). The food dyes referred to in your linked article have been phased out in the UK (and Europe in general) where this blog is written. In fact, it even says as much in the article. Perhaps parents such as yourselves in the US need to be as proactive at getting companies to change their products as we have been in the UK (). It is quite possible to pick up natural food colourings off the shelf in UK supermarkets unlike in the USA () (I live in Texas, currently, so am well aware of how hard they are to come by here). Granted, there is still some chemical sounding stuff in those natural ones, but at a drop or two in a whole batch of paint that they are going to get a small fraction of in their mouth on maybe a day or two a month, let’s keep it in perspective!
Thank you for that excellent comment anon! Thank you x
Corn (because it’s a starchy carb) is kind of an empty calorie food and not a huge nutritional value for baby therefore some people opt not to give their baby cornstarch until after 12 months but as early as 10 months. It can cause gas/diarrhea and can be hard to digest. Having said that, some infant formulas have derivitives of cornstarch such as corn syrup. Further to that, jarred baby food will sometimes have cornstarch especially if it’s a gravy type mix. I’ve recently started giving my 11 mth old creamed corn (homemade) and she seems to have no problem with it. On the dye side of things, try something for red such as beet juice/beet powder (straight from the beet or the water), blue and purple from dark berries, carrots for orange, saffron for yellow and those are just a few suggestions. A quick google search will help with that.
Oh my gosh what a great recipe! Thank you so much for sharing this. I am going to try this out with my two little ones. I know they are going to have so much fun!
Here in the UK the majority of our food colourings ARE natural.
The finger paint is not a food. It is a paint that if it gets into babies mouth then baby will be okay. Therefore it is not necessary for it to be highly calorific or nutritional as that is not it’s primary function.
Thank you very much for that measured and intelligent response!
Hello, I love the paint, anything I have ever tried simply turns to liquid, or just doesn’t have the right consistency. I credited your page on my blog today, for making the edible paint. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. niftythriftymom.1.blogspot.com
Thank you!
I made this today and added a small amount of vanilla essence into it and added some food colouring, not much, but it came out really vibrant!
Ooo what a lovely idea to add the essence! Thanks!
I love the idea of this. I’m always worried about what’s in regular finger paints. This takes all of that worry away. I’m eager to try these with my charges this week.
I have been looking for finger paints to do with my daugther who is just 10 months she loves messy play now I am happy in knowlege that I can now make safe paint for her and we can now make christmas cards togethers for her grandparents
Hey I think this is a great idea..
Just wondering would it work on canvas?
Another way of making edible finger paint is usung vanilla pudding or plain, or vanilla yogurt. And mixing in food color.
Worked great for me, and my 1 year old preferred to use a brush (she’s a bit princessy like that – didn’t want to get her hands dirty, but was happy to have it everywhere if she used a brush) – how do you store the leftover paint and for how long?
I’ve just made this and it was incredibly easy! Really looking forward to letting my 16 month old get stuck in.
Great activity. Just a warning to be careful with the mix if letting little ones gets in and help make it, as it can get pretty hot… I know that is an obvious point- but I’m all for protecting the little ones, and we all forgot common sense at times. My tip for this recipe is to stir it a lot! When you think it is perfect, stir some more! We kept stirring and stirring, and ours eventually became a very similar texture to the paints we used to use at school! We used HEAPS of colour- we got some great brights, but yes beware of staining. My little one has gone down for her afternoon nap a little more yellow than usual (sort of like a Simpsons character). Thanks for this post… I have it earmarked this task for a group activity for one of my Speech Pathology language development groups. I can imagine it will be a hit!
Oh one more thing…. old baby custard glass jars (the heinz branded ones in Australia) are a perfect size for paint pots…. and I feel all green for reusing someonthing
Just done this with my 6 month old, she loved it! It kept her attention for half an hour, which for her is an achievement! The recipe worked great for us, we did need to put in the microwave for a minute, but it came together brilliantly after that. Will be doing it again with big brother later – thanks for the idea!
Can this be stored room temp? Or does it need stored in the fridge? Thanks!
Great so when you give it to the kids they will eat it and love it. But when they go to school and they see paint and they eat it they r going to die. Teaching kids bad things. I don’t allow this happening.
By the time children are school age they are able to understand about what they can and cannot eat. The whole point of this is that babies too young to understand they can’t eat paint can join in.
Wow! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe! Just a quick question: how long do I need to fridge it after adding colouring?
Just shared this idea: it is so clever!
I wish all preschool teachers took the time to make such a child friendly paint and to raise awareness about the many chemicals that are present in many things that are labelled “non-toxic”.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!
just a thought, powdered coloring would give a more vibrant color
Cute idea.when I was a kid we used pudding as finger paint.
Just made this recipe for my kids and they are painting right now! I used cornstarch and it turned out slightly lumpy but it adds to the texture experience Mixing the cornstarch with the cold water until smooth before adding the hot water would fix this problem but I let my 3 year old mix up that part… I didn’t have much food coloring in my cupboard so I used things like coffee grounds, curry powder, paprika, dill, etc… to make the colors. Worked great and added some scent and extra texture
I am going to make this for my daughter’s b-day party. Just thought that I would share what I read on FOOD.com:
. Substitutions: cornmeal pulverized in a food processor.”
I’m sure any whole foods or health foods store would carry it.Thanks for the fun looking recipe!
Tried this. Got soup. Transferred to pot, added more cornstarch and cooked. Ended up with lumpy soup. Very disappointing.
can i store this for later use? how long does it last? Fridge or room temp?
I tried mixing the cornstarch in cold water first, and then instead of adding boiling water, I just added 4 and a half cups of cold water, mixed it again and microwaved it. Super consistency!
I just made this for the first time today for our mums and babies (ages from 6 months to 3 years) and we LOVED it! Thank you so so much for this great recipe. I’m never buying store-made paint again! I loved the consistency of it. I only put in 3.5 cups of boiling water as it seemed enough. The colours turned out beautifully too. It was great that we could hang them up to dry without the paint dripping on to the floor because it’s nice and thick. Will DEFINITELY be making this on a regular basis!
By the way, I’ve linked up to you on my blog, hope that’s ok. Have a look at our homemade paint results.

Flavor-making eggheads might enjoy – before catching themselves and wincing at – comparisons of literary classics and cultish TV shows. I usually do, and I don’t even make flavors. But not all of us at TJP refrain from cultural mélange-ing. Collectively, we revel in coaxing hidden spiritual truths into the light – no matter where they’ve been hiding.
My own doubts battle with the fear that, well, I’ve made a huge mistake. And all because of Helen Rittelmeyer and her blog over at First Things… or actually because of one particular blog post where she masterfully compared Arrested Development to the Russian novel to end all Russian novels - The Brothers Karamazov… O. M. G.
***
First, consider the three great brothers of literature – Ivan, Dmitri, and Alyosha Fyodorovich Karamazov:
Brothers K by spoonybards at
Now, consider three brothers of Orange County: Michael, GOB, and Buster (‘Georgeovich’?) Bluth:
And now let’s compare. The first of each set, Ivan and Michael, is intelligent and plagued by a sense of duty to God and family. The second, Dmitri and GOB, are impulsive, greedy, yet blissfully naïve. How can you hate them? The third, Alyosha and Buster, are young, lovable, and saintly in their devotion to God or family. Or Lucille 2.
***
Parallels abound. TBK holds the storied dialogue of the Grand Inquisitor, confronting Jesus about the problem of evil in the world. Why free will, he asks, if God allows it to be misused? In response, Jesus kisses the elderly inquisitor – right on the lips. Alyosha gets up and does the same to his doubting brother Ivan. Awkward, or endearing?
One wonders if that chapter wasn’t behind this scene between GOB and Michael?
GOB: “Taste the happy, Michael!”
Michael: “Tastes kind of like sad.”
Michael Bluth stays true to what he knows to be good, even when his brain tells him to cut and run. Like Ivan Fyodorovich, he’s rarely sure it’s worth the effort to do good – but he does it anyway.
I’ve one more comparison worth throwing into the mix: both Arrested Development and Brothers K are acquired tastes. I’ve coached friends to stick with AD for at least three episodes before they get the humor. And I’ve ditched TBK after reading thirty dread pages more than once. But hard-won treats are worth it, which explains why both keep popping up, with promises of an AD movie (praise the Lord!) and fourth season (praise all His works!).
***
You may still be doubting. I can respect that.
But consider this: AD’s creator Mitch Hurwitz has a degree in theology and English from Georgetown. No tricks – and no illusions.

Yesterday, the Daily Telegraph reported that the UK’s creative industries generate £36 billion per year for the economy and employ 1.5 million people. The Chancellor, George Osborne, called them “massively important”. So why does no-one take comedy seriously?
The English Arts Council will not give grants to comedians staging shows at the Edinburgh Fringe, because they do not consider comedy to be an art.
But, last year, the University of East Anglia (UEA) got a £300,000 grant for a three-year study into “the nature of creativity within the British television comedy industry by exploring the working practices of industry professionals, and the industrial, institutional and policy contexts that shape and inform what they do.”
The study is called Make Me Laugh. It started in January 2012 and ends in December 2014. The ‘Principal Investigator’ is Dr Brett Mills. He is Head of the UEA’s School of Film, Television and Media Studies and I chatted to him a couple of days ago.
“We’re working with loads of writers, producers and commissioners,” he told me, “following comedy projects from initial idea through to broadcast or, as is often the case, non-broadcast and abandonment and resignation and unhappiness. We’re trying to look at what makes creativity – however you define that – happen and what are the things that get in its way.”
“You’ve done previous studies of comedy,” I said. “Isn’t this just a way to get another £300,000?”
“The first project was about £4,000,” laughed Brett. “and I just interviewed people, but interviewing individuals doesn’t give you a sense of relationships and networks, the development of a project and how things change over time. One other problem was that, when I asked people how decisions were made, the answer I tended to get was Gut instinct and, to a researcher, that’s utterly useless. The aim of this project is to try to unpick that.”
“Have you read Adventures in the Screen Trade by William Goldman?” I asked.
“Very deliberately no,” said Brett.
“Why?”
“Because,” explained Brett, “it’s one of those books everyone says you have to read – and because there is a split in academic terms between Film Studies and Television Studies. The set of approaches you would use in Film Studies would use that book. The set of approaches you would use in Television Studies would be totally different in academic terms.”
“Mmmm,” I said, “You know the often misunderstood quote about Nobody knows anything...?”
“Yeah,” said Brett wearily.
“…which” I continued, “basically means that creativity is an art not a science. Aren’t you trying to make it a science?”
“A gut instinct, in a way,” said Brett, “is just an internalised set of things you have learned. In most industries, you develop a gut instinct.”
“So is creating and commissioning TV shows a science or an art?” I asked.
“Well, it’s a bit of both,” Brett replied. “And, if we get into the area of whether something is ‘good’ or not, are we talking about critically acclaimed or watched by a lot of people or loved by a lot of people? Or about having a legacy and being watched 10 or 15 years later? It depends what you’re measuring.”
“Anyone who makes something VERY popular,” I suggested, “is immediately attacked as being ‘trite’ and ‘low-brow’ and ‘bland’.”
“Well” said Brett, “I don’t think anyone we’ve spoken to is embarrassed about making something popular.”
“Can your research,” I asked, “explain why Mrs Brown’s Boys is loved by audiences but hated by a lot of so-called cognoscenti in the media and the comedy industry?”
“No,” said Brett, “because that’s a different project I’d love to do, which is talking to audiences. This current project is about the process by which things come into existence. Miranda would be fascinating because there is a gender division: women love it.”
“Women of all ages?” I asked.
“Yes,” said Brett, “and, this is purely anecdotal, but it’s a kind of family thing where the women sit down to watch it and the dad leaves the room because he can’t stand it.”
“Is there statistical evidence that more women like it than men?” I asked.
“It’s probably very likely,” said Brett, “because – although these are statistics from seven or eight years ago – the vast majority of mainstream sitcoms on television are always watched by more women than men. Men Behaving Badly was watched by more women than men.”
“Doesn’t studying comedy academically make watching comedy less interesting?” I asked.
“No” said Brett, “people who read recipes like food; it doesn’t mean they start hating food. In fact, in some ways, you start appreciating it more. Even the stuff that doesn’t make me laugh I can still find fascinating.
“I grew up in the 1980s with The Young Ones on TV and the Alternative Comedy people doing their stuff and Malcolm Hardee doing his stuff.
“I’m very anti this idea that the aim of academic research is about cultural hierarchies and we should only look at the best: that we should construct a ‘canon of good work’.
“That’s one of the interesting things about the department I’m in at the moment: most people are interested in the popular, the mainstream. We don’t see our job as deciding what is good culture and what is crap culture.”
“I suspect,” I said, “that the audiences who originally went to see Shakespeare’s plays went to see them as Brian Rix farces or blood-soaked splatter tragedies.”
“Exactly,” said Brett. “Most of the creators of stuff that’s held up as ‘art’ now – Shakespeare, Dickens – were unbelievably popular in their own day. It was mainstream culture. Dickens wrote serial fiction. It’s not as if he had an artistic vision. He was thinking: Oh, that character’s popular, I’ll write more of him in the next episode.
“The idea that you retrospectively construct these people as artistic visionaries and so on… No… Shakespeare was writing for an audience. He was a populist.
“Exploring popular culture is an interesting battle, because our field – Media Studies – often gets criticised as a Mickey Mouse subject, not ‘proper’. And, by looking at popular culture, you actually feed into that prejudice… I have a colleague who does research on reality television and people do just go Oh! That’s a stupid subject! But No. We’re having to have that fight and we will man the barricades.
“This current Make Me Laugh project very definitely connects to that.
“Lots of film directors and novelists whose work is seen by far fewer people are interviewed and profiled and their views are kept for posterity. And yet you have people creating popular mainstream culture consumed by millions and millions of people and they’re going to disappear into history. Nobody’s interviewing them. Nobody’s exploring their working practices whereas any old Croatian art house film director has probably been interviewed by Sight & Sound twenty times and had five books written about him.
“I sometimes ask my students: Give me a list of film directors and they can rattle off a hundred. Then I say: Tell me a television director. And the only ones they can tell me are film directors who’ve done television. They’ll say Oh, Quentin Tarantino directed an episode of CSI didn’t he?
“They’ll know Miranda Hart herself. But the producer of Miranda? The director? No. They don’t even know their names.
“These people are creating a whole range of culture, but nobody’s heard of them. To me, that’s a real outrage. And it’s backed-up by the fact that, when you contact people, wanting to interview them, their first response is: Why would you want to talk to me?
“I tell them: If you were an art house film director, you wouldn’t ask that question. You’re writing a comedy that’s watched by ten million people every week and you’re confused that I find you of interest!” That, in itself, is fascinating to me.
“One of the ways Britain defines its national identity is via comedy. We see that as really important. How did we define ourselves last year in the Olympic Opening Ceremony? With Mr Bean… and the Queen jumping out of a helicopter. It was comedy, comedy. comedy!
“Comedy is central to our idea of national identity and the economic value of the comedy industry is massive. Just take Mr Bean and the amount of money that’s produced around the world.
“The economic value of the comedy industry – including films, television and stand-up is absolutely massive. Yet the amount of public money that goes into theatre and opera and other cultural forms… compared to the amount that goes into, say, stand-up comedy (even though there is public money via the Licence Fee going into BBC TV) is virtually nil.
“But, then, if you talk to people in small independent production companies and suggest Shouldn’t the government be supporting you more? they tell you No! We wanna stay separate. That’s the whole point. We’re outsiders. We’re mavericks.
“The creative industries in Britain employ more people than the engineering industry and the pharmaceutical industry. The creative industries contribute more to the economy than the financial industries.”
“Really?” I asked.
“Yes,” said Brett firmly. “Television, film, architecture, design, music, computer games. The scale of the creative industries is absolutely massive. And it is still one of the areas where Britain is accepted internationally as a world leader.”
“So why are you not aspiring to be a television producer or commissioner?” I asked.
“Because I don’t have that gut instinct,” replied Brett. “Not at all. Not at all.”

Folkadelphia Session: Spirit and Dust & Small Houses (dual album release edition)
Spirit & Dust and Small Houses are two Philadelphia groups that I admire and have frequently played on the radio show. While they make markedly different sounding music from each other, bringing them together for an upcoming dual album release show this Saturday, the 23rd, makes total sense.
Spirit & Dust, in full band configuration (a standard rock formation plus trumpets, keys, and harmonies), work up to music and lyrics that are informed by the band’s evident love for emotional Americana and lead member Kristen Sylvester’s mystical and spiritual leanings. On the other hand, Small Houses, the moniker for Jeremy Quentin’s music, takes a more stripped down approach and winds up approximating the now classic songwriters of the ‘70s (someone recently told me that Quentin’s newest album Exactly Where You Wanted To Be invokes the same vibe as Springsteen’s Nebraska).
But it’s the common elements between Spirit & Dust and Small Houses that led me to record this week’s Folkadelphia Sessions and subsequently present their release concert happening this coming Saturday, February 23rd at Studio 34 in West Philly with Sean Hoots. Both groups write music that is just so organic, so rich in imagery and story-telling, and so attuned to their emotions that for them to share a stage will be a chill-inducing night at an intimate venue. These are the kind of musical pairings I think about daily! Make sure to mark it on your calendar as you check out the sessions.

I thought Senator McCain, who became the mortal lock for the Republican presidential nomination with the suspension of Mitt Romney's campaign today, gave a strong, meaningful speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference today.
It was no stemwinder and the Senator isn't a naturally gifted speaker but it was a success because he was forthright but conciliatory, didn't flip-flop, attacked both Senator Clinton and Obama and struck the right notes in terms of how differently he or either of his opponents would lead America.
Opening with a quote from Edmund Burke that liberty was bestowed by the Creator and protected by the government rather than the opposite was a nice touch. So was describing himself as a 'foot-soldier of the Reagan Revolution' (though I am told this has been a staple)
What McCain needs to do now is assemble the coalition and get folks like James Dobson on board because he'll need every vote in November, especially if his opponent is Senator Obama. Romney would not be bad as economics czar and possible Secretary of the Treasury. And on the short list of VPs, a solidly conservative, well respected, well connected governor like Haley Barbour of Mississippi might be just the ticket. (You heard it here first.)

Alicia Keys has been hit or miss with her live performances during the last few months but last evening at the 2013 NBA All-Star game, her vocal cords finally packed up their belongings and left. On the bright side, their neighbouring body parts, abdominals and clear skin, stayed behind to help Keys look good during her set.
Everything seemed fine when Keys started her NBA All-Star show with a rendition of “Empire State of Mind (Part 2)” but things quickly fell apart when she tried to sing “Girl on Fire”. Despite the lower key of the revamped version of the tune, the diva still struggled to hit the right notes and her voice noticeably cracked on numerous occasions.
Keys then attempted to finish her set with performances of “No One” – as in no one told her that singing that tune was a bad idea – and “New Day”. What resulted were several uncomfortable moments for Jay-Z, Beyonce and John Legend, who probably looked on from the crowd and wondered if they could politely sneak out the back door without hurting their friend’s feelings.
Watch Keys perform at the NBA All-Star Game below:

5: 05 A.M. In Church’s Early Days, a Handful of Non-European Popes
As news accounts have noted, Pope Francis is a man of many firsts: the first Jesuit selected to lead the Roman Catholic Church, and the first pope from Latin America. And the media has also highlighted that he is the first pope from outside Europe in 1,300 years, which raises the question: under what circumstances did Catholicism embrace a non-European pope?
In fact, during the first First Millennium it was not that uncommon to have popes who were born or had roots outside Europe, with several having been born in northern Africa or the Middle East. Most notable, of course, was Saint Peter, a disciple of Jesus who, as the first bishop of Rome, was considered the first pope and for whom Saint Peter’s Basilica is named. According to Catholic Online, he was born in Bethsaida on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee and, according to Catholic teaching, established the church with the Apostle Paul in Rome, where he was crucified under Emperor Nero.
While early details about the lives of popes from the First Millennium are scarce, three popes are believed to have been either born or have had roots in Africa: Pope Victor I, who served for a decade starting in the year 189; Pope Miltiades, who served from either 310 or 311 until 314, and Pope Gelasius I, who had African roots but was believed to have been born in Rome. The popes with African roots reflected how at the beginning of the First Millennium, Rome still controlled large parts of coastal North Africa at a time when Christianity was spreading through the empire.
At least one pope, Theodore I, was born in Jerusalem and was considered Greek. And the last pope born outside Europe was John V, who was a Syrian born in Antioch in what is now part of Turkey. He oversaw the church for slightly more than a year starting in the summer of 685, ruling during the so-called Byzantine papacy, when Byzantium, which had previously controlled parts of Syria, held wide sway over the papal affairs.

In his native Argentina, the new pope’s ascension was welcomed by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in a statement posted online.
A su Santidad Francisco I
— Cristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) 13 Mar 13
But, as the Argentine newspaper La Nación reports, the president has had a strained relationship with the religious leader, particularly over his opposition to gay-rights legislation. In 2010, Reuters explains, Cardinal Bergoglio made his opposition to a gay marriage bill public in a letter, just days before it was approved. “Let’s not be naïve,” he wrote. “This isn’t a simple political fight, it’s an attempt to destroy God’s plan.”
As our colleague Alexei Barrionuevo reported at the time:.
Spanish speakers can read more about his opposition to gay marriage and abortion on La Nación‘s site, where there is also a video compilation of his “most controversial speeches.”
The Lede is signing off for the evening. Thanks for reading. We leave you with this report of confusion over the pope’s new name, from Iran’s state-owned satellite news channel Press TV.

As our Rome bureau chief, Rachel Donadio, notes on Twitter, the conclave of cardinals in Rome appears to have made the same sort of choice that the Republican Party in the United States habitually does when it comes to nominating a presidential candidate — picking the previous cycle’s runner-up.
The Argentine Cardinal Bergoglio, a Jesuit, was seen as a close second behind Benedict in 2005.
— Rachel Donadio — NYT (@RachelDonadio) 13 Mar 13
The Catholic News Service adds:
A respected Italian journal said Cardinal Bergoglio, 76, was the cardinal with the second-highest number of votes on each of the four ballots in the 2005 conclave.
The journal, Limes, said its report was based on information that came from the diary of an anonymous cardinal who, while acknowledging he was violating his oath of secrecy, felt the results of the conclave votes should be part of the historic record.
The journal said it confirmed the diary’s count with other cardinals.

In 2010, 33% of #Catholics in Argentina said #religion is “very important” in their lives. @pewglobal
— Pew Forum (@pewforum) 13 Mar 13
With 31 million Catholics out of 40 million residents, Argentina has the 11th largest Catholic population in the world, according to the Pew Center for Research.
A 2010 Pew study found that 33 percent of Catholics interviewed in Argentina cited religion as very important in their lives. Nearly 20 percent said they attended mass weekly, with nearly 40 percent volunteering that they prayed daily.
In 2010-19% of Argentinean #Catholics said they attend mass at least weekly, but 39% said they pray daily @pewglobal
— Pew Forum (@pewforum) 13 Mar 13
But despite the large number of Catholics, the former Cardinal Bergoglio was not always able to sway political leaders in Argentina over the years to support his views. He did not stop President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner from promoting free contraception and artificial insemination.
And in 2010 he clashed with political leaders over same-sex marriage. According to the National Catholic Register, he said the legislation, which was eventually approved, would “seriously damage heart.”
The country’s large number of Catholics also did not influence the ruling party to interrupt a ceremony for the late Hugo Chávez, noted a detailed report by Foreign Policy on the news media reaction to the first Latin American pope.
On Wednesday, Clarin, Argentina’s largest newspaper, reports that a dispute erupted in the lower house of Argentina’s National Congress over whether lawmakers should interrupt the ceremony to listen to the new pope’s first words. The ceremony was completed before attention turned to Pope Francis.
In Argentina, he focused his efforts on defending the poor and on social justice issues, according to The National Catholic Reporter. He chided priests last year for refusing to baptize children of single mothers.
“We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least,” he told Latin American bishops in 2007. “The unjust distribution of goods persists, creating a situation of social sin that cries out to Heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers.”
Other reaction expressed on Twitter and in media reports in Argentina, while positive over all, raised questions about the role he may have played when the country was ruled by dictators and thousands of people, including priests, disappeared. In 2010, he was asked to testify about the disappearance of two Jesuit priests in 1976. His spokesman called any allegations that he was involved “scandalous.”

As our colleagues on the Graphics desk report, the election of Argentina’s first pope, and the first non-European leader of the church in more than 1,200 years, could reflect changes in the relative popularity of the religion across the globe. “Over the last century,” they note, “much of the growth of the Roman Catholic Church has been outside Europe, and there are now more than 200 million more Catholics in Latin America than in Europe.”
As our Rome bureau chief, Rachel Donadio, notes, the church is also facing “growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere.”
The election of the first Argentine pope prompted elation and plenty of jokes about soccer on Wednesday in Argentina.

The former Cardinal Bergoglio is “a fan of the Buenos Aires soccer team San Lorenzo, which was founded by a priest,” Bloomberg News reports. Apparent visual confirmation of that allegiance soon appeared on Twitter.
Jorge Bergoglio, hincha de #SanLorenzo, es el nuevo Papa.
— Marcela Nicolau (@cuervamarce) 13 Mar 13
Some in Argentina responded to the news by suggesting that the new pope might soon eclipse even Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi in fame. Others noted that it seemed fitting that the new pope had reportedly once touched the “hand of God,” in reference to a comment Maradona made after infamously scoring a goal against England in the 1986 World Cup with his fist. After the match, Maradona came close to admitting that he had cheated when he said the goal had been scored, in part, by “the hand of God.”

Like the current Argentine star Messi, the new pope is descended from Italian immigrants. On the first day of the conclave, as the first votes were cast, soccer journalists watching Messi score two outstanding goals joked that even as the world was without a pope, there was no doubt about the identity of god.

The activities of the 115 members of the College of Cardinals to select the successor to Benedict XVI retained their mystery to the very end. But almost as soon as hints of white smoke puffed forth from the Sistine Chapel’s chimney, signaling the selection of Francis as the church’s new pope, people in and around Vatican City and Rome were sharing their experiences on social media services like Twitter.
Some visitors of the Vatican shared their excitement to be first to see the white smoke and its telegraphing of the news of the pope’s election:

Elsewhere in Rome, a resident caught a hint of smoke from his home, situated not too far from the Sistine Chapel:
La #fumata bianca da casa mia :) #papa #habemuspapam
— Matteo Manna (@matteomanna) 13 Mar 13
While not everyone in Rome could see the smoke, many heard bells across the city, informing them of the news in a way that evoked times when many people in the world weren’t glued to a smartphone or a television screen (even if their reaction was to share the experience on Twitter):
All the bells ringing cross Rome – the new Pope has been chosen
— Zeynep Esendemir (@zee_esendemir) 13 Mar 13
These sights and sounds led to some people in Rome to drop what they were doing and rush for the place where the words “Habemus Papum” would be declared:
You can hear the bells of the #Vatican ringing from my apartment. Off to #St.Peters I go!
— Minki Bai (@minkibai) 13 Mar 13

— Kevin Maher (@kevin_maherPSU) 13 Mar 13
Meanwhile, those who braved the elements to see Pope Francis I be introduced on the balcony expressed their amazement at being on the scene:
I cannot believe I just witnessed the election of Papa Francesco
— Erin Mishu (@ErinMishu) 13 Mar 13
Back in the United States, the University of Notre Dame found a way to share in the spirit of the moment, even if though it was far away:
The Basilica bells toll as white smoke comes from the Vatican
— Notre Dame (@NotreDame) 13 Mar 13
— Michael Roston
The White House released the following statement from President Obama.
Statement from @CardinalDolan on election of Pope Francis I
— USCCB (@USCCB) 13 Mar 13
Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued a statement: of New York
President
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The official papal Twitter feed, @Pontifex, has now become active again.
HABEMUS PAPAM FRANCISCUM
— Pontifex (@Pontifex) 13 Mar 13
An earlier version of this update incorrectly identified another Twitter account as the former Cardinal’s personal account.
— Robert Mackey
The new pope has emerged onto the Vatican balcony. He begins by addressing the largely Italian crowd in their own language, “Buona Sera.” He goes on to lead a prayer for the retired Pope Benedict.
The new pope is from Argentina, but has Italian roots.
Although the speculation is that the new pope chose his name in honor of Francis Xavier, a Spanish founder of the Jesuit order, there could also be an Italian connection.
Hours after the world’s attention was focused on the seagull sitting atop the Sistine Chapel’s chimney, the first Latin American pope has apparently taken the name of the Italian St. Francis of Assisi, who was known for his love of animals, including birds.
Italians chanting “Francesco! Francesco!” Choice of St Francis’ name may indicate humble papacy #pope #reuterspope
— Naomi O’Leary (@NaomiOhReally) 13 Mar 13
Here’s the new Pope: Jorge Mario Bergoglio. He will be called Pope Francis. Live updates:
— Anthony De Rosa (@AntDeRosa) 13 Mar 13
— Robert Mackey
The announcement is that Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the new pope. Cardinal Bergoglio reportedly got about 40 votes in the early balloting last time, and has chosen the name Pope Francis.
— Robert Mackey
As we wait to hear the identity of the new pope, keep in mind that it will be announced in Latin, which has prompted observers to run through the names of some of the front-runners in that language. If you Marcus, for instance, the new pope is likely to be Marc Ouellet of Canada.
Lot’s of people hoping for a #pope from their own country! Lots of Canadians here praying for Ouellet #conclave #reuterspope
— Naomi O’Leary (@NaomiOhReally) 13 Mar 13
— Robert Mackey
As we continue to wait for the announcement of who the new pope is, here is video of the white smoke that poured from the chimney above the Sistine Chapel about 40 minutes ago.
— Robert Mackey
Our colleague Laurie Goodstein explains in a Twitter update that Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran is expected to appear on the balcony shortly and announce the name of the new pope, in Latin.
First guy out on the balcony is not the new pope: it’s Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran to announce “Habemus Papam” and Latin name.
— Laurie Goodstein (@lauriegnyt) 13 Mar 13
Pope’s first blessing is “Urbi et orbi,” – “to the city and the world.”
— Laurie Goodstein (@lauriegnyt) 13 Mar 13
— Robert Mackey
All eyes are trained now on the Vatican balcony in St. Peter’s Square, where the news of the new pope’s identity will be revealed shortly. Our colleague Rachel Donadio reports on Twitter from the scene that the announcement could take up to 30 minutes to come.
Absolutely electric atmosphere as bell rings, crowds shriek delightedly and rush towards basilica to see new #pope #reuterspope
— Naomi O’Leary (@NaomiOhReally) 13 Mar 13
Habemus Papam, the crowds cheer, but we won’t know who he is for another half-hour or so.
— Rachel Donadio — NYT (@RachelDonadio) 13 Mar 13
— Robert Mackey
As bells toll, the crowd gathered in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday can be heard on the live video stream from Vatican TV’s YouTube channel cheering and chanting “Habemus Papam!” Latin for “We Have a Pope!”
Bells are now ringing all over Rome for the election of a new pope! This city is marvelous with bells.

When, at some future date, you are reading about the poor decision making that led to the demise of Fox Broadcasting you'll know that it started here.
What began as a visit to possibly the flattest and brownest place on Earth will now be at least one hour of television about flatness and brownness. It could all go horribly wrong, but I suspect that at a bare minimum we'll get a pretty trainwreck out of it. It's hard and occasionally forbidden to write about work, but I'll keep you in the loop to the extent possible.
If you wish to send congratulatory cookies I will name extras after you.

How about a box of Rice Krispies Treats like they sell over at Sams Club? My dogs follow me around the house anytime I try to eat one. At least you'd only have to share with two kids and a wife.
Congrats on a show about one of my favorite places on earth. When do you start shooting the pilot?
You know the show would probably be much more interesting - and INFINITELY more sleazy - if it was called "Odessa." Seriously, it's a testament to your talent that you could make the tall city worthy of its own show. I'll get Mike baking on some cookies. P.S. Were the Hitler references part of this pilot? I mean it makes sense - we all know he's in hell.
Congratulations!
Thanks to all. To be clear, any type of sweets will be accepted as long as they're not fruit, which is a fake sweet.
@AME - No Hitler, he was threatening to work his way into the other project due last week, but you make an interesting point and I'll be sure to pitch him to the network as a surprise guest if we make it to series.
"Midland, Midland, that's my hometown." I think my parents still have the record recording of it from the 70s. You should look into it. Congrats!

And while Osama Bin Laden has been able to "elude" forces, Anne is walking around for everyone to see, getting booked on The View and Larry King and no one has arrested her for spewing her hate speech.
Besides, isn't she considered a danger to herself and others? You know, a 5150?
This terrorist has also been accused of being a man.
Her prominent Adams' Apple and giant hands have long been used to "prove" the theory. But I ask you to take a look at Science. Y'all are on the right track by looking at her giant hands, but you need to look a little closer.
It's all about the length of the fingers and this is difference is true about MOST people.
Basically, on a woman, the index finger is longer than the ring finger. Men's hands are built opposite. The index finger on men is shorter than the ring finger.
The pinkie finger is also longer on MOST men's hands.
Currently, with so many advancements made in cosmetic surgery, feminization operations exist for just about everything. Even an Adam's Apple can be shaved down. The only thing they can't do, is change the way the hand is built.
I could be wrong, but I'll let Anatomy speak for itself. In the meantime, compare and contrast with your female and transexual friends.
So I'm not the only one who thinks she's a trannie. Damn!
I've often referred to it as MAnn Coulter, but usually cunt, whore, bitch, etc.
She is clearly a terrorist, with a visible adam's apple.
I know we're not supposed to hate because that is what she does. I will just say I LOATHE her existence. If ONLY her mother had been pro-choice!
Oh, I need to edit my prior comment! Why can't blogger allow us to do this? Please replace 'she' with 'it' and 'her' with 'its'!

Afterburner Roast by Ground Control
1964 was a great year!! One of my favorite events during this very historical time in our country was my birth at Luke Air Force Base near the White Tank Mountains of Arizona. LOL.
Last week I coerced my Mom into taking me to Base so I could reconnect with my past; to see what had changed and what had stayed the same after so many years. Our timing was perfect! Lucky for us we were able to see some of the new F-35 jets fly in formation, peel off one at a time then land one the flight line. As a kid, I remember parking next to the road at the end of the line watching the F-15s and F-16s land one right after another. I could sit there for hours … the precision, the sound, the strength, and oddly magical … it has always given me a thrill!
Still on a natural high, we took Litchfield Road south past the lower entrance and guess what we found? One of the biggest independent coffeehouses I’ve seen yet: Ground Control, owned by one of the training pilots at Luke, Sean Rassas and his wife Tara. They have successfully brought together their love of coffee, community, food, world class beer and wine. This is “where community happens”!
Luke AFB
They also roast their own coffee daily right there in the entry space that is both their roastery and the front counter. This multi-purpose room also serves as storage for their bags of green beans and the espresso machine where the baristas tamp out yummy shots of java. They recently delivered a select roast to Oskar Blues, a small brewery in northern Colorado. to brew up their very own coffee stout.
GET OUT OF HERE!!! How cool is that? ~LisaGround Control 4860 N Litchfield Rd.

Biography: Jim Wootten
The Voice of Randy Meisner and Timothy B. Schmit, Bass Guitar
Long Run bassist Jim Wootten comes from a very musical family which bred many professional musicians, most notably, his father Red Wootten who played bass with Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman and Woody Herman, and his uncle and aunt, recording artists Les Paul and Mary Ford.  8 years. "I particularly enjoy playing in tribute bands because of the challenge of trying to replicate an artist's music with note for note accuracy."
Jim has had the pleasure to perform with Carmine Appice (Vanilla Fudge, Rod Stewart), Howard Leese (Heart), Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme) and Paul Gilbert (Mr. Big) among others.
When Jim was approached about the possibility of filling the Long Run's vacancy at the bass position, he jumped at the chance. "The Eagles have always been one of my favorite bands, and knowing the quality of musicianship that existed in this group, I was very excited to come on board.
Jim also plays in the popular Led Zeppelin tribute Led Zepagain as well as Blue Bayou (a tribute to Linda Ronstadt).

WHY VOTE?
by Randall Knox & Matt Gonzalez
CHANGE BEGINS WITH YOU
While our system of democracy was designed to represent us all, in practice we find that government belongs only to those who assert their influence over it. Your influence is your voice. And your voice is your vote. The beauty of our political system is that every vote carries equal weight – whether your polling place is in Pacific Heights or in Sunnydale.
The right to vote is so essential to our process of civic leadership that many have given their lives to ensure this right was extended to all. Civil rights activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman in Mississippi and Viola Liuzzo in Alabama were all murdered simply for registering African American voters. And their efforts came after decades of struggle to eliminate unfair poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses, all of which prevented African American citizens of this country from exercising this fundamental right.
YOUR VOICE MUST BE HEARD
Today, in San Francisco, big businesses, the affluent, and the influential all go to great lengths to organize their families, friends and peers to ensure that they are represented at the polls. And most often, they vote to protect their own interests, not yours.
The wealthy in San Francisco don’t contend with polluting power plants in their neighborhoods. Police in their districts don’t behave the way they do in the Bayview. Street repairs don’t take months to get completed. Do you think it’s an accident?
If you want change you have to vote for it. Vote for someone who will champion your causes – jobs with dignity, affordable housing, a safe environment for you and your families, and access to quality education and healthcare.
TAKE ACTION. VOTE!

Hey, is there a way to add a Page 1, Page 2, etc in the gallery sections? I have way to many thumbs at this point, would like to put some of them onto a second page
Hey there, yes ofcourse just copy the pagination code from the note section and link it to second page third page so on.
Hello, before purchasing it, I see that the home sliding image doesn’t resize on mobile view. Is it possible correct it?
Great template (purchased). I notice that on iOS devices (iPhone 5), the slideshow background images for index.html background are squeezed horizontally (or stretched vertically) when viewed in portrait mode. They are not squeezed or stretched when viewed in landscape mode. My images are sized according to suggested 1024px x 700px. Thanks in advance! For reference, dev testing page is located at
Hasan Same question as above ( this time from the purchased account ) When I use the flexslider I noticed that the navigation buttons below the slider do not work. Click on them does nothing. Any ideas how to fix this?
Also in the in the portfoliostrip.html file, if I only have 4 stripes and I comment out the rest, the last stripe disappears until I hover or move the mouse over it …
Your help much appreciated Thank you Sarah
Hey Sarah
Thank you very much for your business. I apologize you are having some problems. The fix to the home-page slider is as simple as adding img width 100% in css for supersized slider. If you want a more specific fix, as in exact code, feel free to email me and I will get back to you.
For portfolio stripe, you will need a minimum of 10 stripes to work perfect, because of the infinite scroll left and right, the stripes have to meet a minimum combined width to actually allow scroll.
For flexslider, I will have a look and get back to you.
Thanks again
Hey Hasan No issues with home slider, all good there. Portfolio stripe works well, I just added blank images and left 10 items there. I am sure I will be filling them up pronto
– Is there an easy way to not allow users to move stripes around. ie. disable it ?
Please let me know about the flexSlider issue
Thank you for your prompt response
S
Hey Sarah
I checked the portfolio page slider on my android device everything seems to be working fine, and Other versions of this tempalte have not had any problems either, are you sure there isnt an issue on your end. Just to be safe I will have access to an iphone 5 this evening, I will confirm it.
For the stripe, do you mean you want to disable the scrolling of stripes? If so yes it is extremely easy, however it might end up breaking your layout, unless ofcourse you want to disable it because you dont have enough stripes yet. In which case simple remove the call for the script in main.js
If you have any problems with it feel free to email me through my profile.
Thanks
Hi maybe i didnt explain properly, sorry. On the portfolio stripe page its all fine now. Thank you.
Next I took the basic item .html file and customized it to what i need. However, the navigation at the bottom of the slide does not work. It displays fine ( 5 images, i get 5 items on the nav ) but if i click on any of the nav icons nothing happens. Lets say on I am on image number 4 on the slider, if I click on the first Nav icon, should it not display the first image again? clicking does not at the moment
Hope that makes sense
Thx
Sarah
Hey Sarah , yes it should. Well the issue is definitely on your side as you can see it works fine on the demo. However if you post your link, I will have a look. If you dont want to post the link here, you can email me from my profile.
Thanks
Thanks Hasan … will email you link to test site ciao Sarah
Hasan I cant find the sendmail/php package in the zip file. Should that be included to send email via the contact form ? Thanks Sarah
Nevermind, Robert it found it
Hi Hasan, Great theme, just wanted to know if you can make the header stick to the top of the screen when viewing the site on a mobile? if so how do you go about it? Also do .png image files show up on the mobile version? thanks in advance.
tezzataz , the header by default sticks to top on mobile devices.
Thanks for getting back to me Hasan, sorry I meant to get back to you about this but forgot. In mobile view when you go from portrait to landscape and then back to portrait (when you turn the phone sideways and then go turn back to normal view) the page doesn’t seem to resize back to normal, is there a fix for this? (i’ve only been viewing your template on ipad and iphones) thanks again.
Tezzataz no matter how many times I switch between portrait and landscape mode on my phone the page resizes accordingly. So I cant confirm what you see.
Thanks

SoulBoy #15
(Sam And Dave – Goodnight Baby)
Staying on board the Soul Train for this week as there are far too many cuts and artists who have yet to be featured..Marvin Gaye, Bobby Womack, James Carr, Sam Cooke, Teddy Pendergrass, Al Green, Aaron Neville, Bobby Bland, Solomon Burke and on and on and on in fact a year still wouldn’t be long enough to dig deep into the Soul Cellar so another week is the LEAST I can do.
Too many pieces to choose from…must have lined up at least 5 cuts…just as I’m about to prepare one a next piece floats out of the speakers to distract my butterfly mind. So without further delay hold this piece from one of the great duets Sam Moore and Dave Prater. So electric were they on stage that Otis Redding refused to go on after them. 1965 release on the Stax Label.

Lila Afiouni: Well, I am very much inspired by other artists and it is my belief that if you challenge yourself and get out into the world to see some seminal pieces of art, you will be inspired. So I came to SFO to see art I wouldn't normally see in Australia, such as Bruce Conner, Diebenkorn, and modern American artists that influence my work. I am also attracted to SFO as a city, a place that was surging with literature and art in the 1950s. This made a tremendous impact on my sense of what 'freedom' is and that is important to me as an artist.
CB: Talk about Bruce Conner...what aspects about his work do you admire?
LA: I first heard about Bruce Conner in connection to the Beat writers. I had been making collage work, but when I saw Conner's work, it was more delicate, unassuming and feminine. His body of work really is mysterious because he works in so many styles. He also makes films. I just like how eclectic he was. In regards to how he treated the mainstream media – he was deliberately subversive and this interested me because despite his illusive persona and his underwhelming presence in the art world (a premeditated act of his own), he was prolific and is very much a celebrated SF artist.
CB: And with Ginsberg, is there a direct correlation in some silent undertone that finds its way into any of your pieces?
LA: That's a tough question. As as you know I'm a huge fan of Ginsberg. I also write poetry. He has been an influence yes for sure, his writing, the context of his work in America, the grittiness and honesty of it. I mean, my work is not literal, it's abstract, so it's hard to find the correlation except that perhaps I am making work that could be reflected of his time, in terms of emotion and honesty.
CB: You've been in SFO for over a month now, right?
LA: Two months now.
CB: Do you find your methods of working changing at all with the change of view?
LA: Before I came to SFO, I was making work for a show at Hardware Gallery in Sydney, and I seemed to have a breakthrough. I am still carrying on that style of work which is essentially neo-geometric abstraction. The only change of view is that the colors are a little softer as I seem to be absorbing the color combinations of the Victorian houses here. Their facades are very beautiful, even the weathered ones.
CB: Does the architecture in Sydney inspire you?
LA: The architecture in Sydney is not as consistent; it’s more of a sprawling red-brick house suburban attitude and not so inspiring. I would say the ocean down the street from where I live is more inspiring as a body of raw energy and power. This new work takes me to a more spiritual level of harmony and balance.
CB: Are there any special places that you return to in SFO when you visit?
LA: I'm a sucker for Haight-Ashbury. It still has a great bohemian feel to it. I love North Beach, too. It's not so populated and you can feel the literary history there. It's great just walking the streets around North Beach.
CB: You just began a new painting...can you talk about this yet?
LA: Hmm. I think I began another new painting since we talked! I construct my paintings like an architectural piece, one part must support another. It must all fall into place otherwise it won't stand alone.
CB: A writer might have a conversation, read a news article, or something – and happen across a hot topic that must be addressed right then and there. Does it work like this for you?
LA: Not for me. It's like continuing an ongoing conversation that I have had for months. It might start with an idea of Pythagoras and his notion that the world is based on numbers and have a certain balance that exists in the world, and then it keeps going, harmony might be the next phase. It's like a time line that keeps unfolding.
CB: I notice I'm about 16 months late, but do you have any of those limited edition postcards left you mention on your site?
LA: I certainly do. I can post them over to you...
CB: Nice! Thank you. I love postcards. They're the only things left in the world I love to post to people. I can't write legibly, and my thoughts work different when I hold a pen. My first art postcards was a collection by...not Klimt...the other guy.
LA: Egon Schiele.
CB: Schiele! He's one of my favorites. I shouldn't have got stumped on his name.
LA: I think Shiele was Klimt's pupil but don't quote me on that.
CB: How did your Paris residency come about?
LA: I had to apply for the Paris residency through the Power Institute of Art and Culture in Australia. It's an award. I sent them my work and they liked it so I went over to the Cite Internationale des Arts for four months. I was given a live-in space and a studio in a complex of about 300 other studios. The energy was amazing, artists, musicians, writers from all over the globe lived there. You really felt like anything could happen. Often I would sit in my studio and wait for something to happen and sure enough, my phone would ring and I'd be invited to a show or some kind of happening. Things were going on all over Paris, obscure things that would never happen in Australia.
CB: I often wonder how many artists out there have mentors or great teachers that were instructional or influential during some part of their lives. Did you find yourself in the company of any such figure in Paris?
LA: Actually, while I was at the residency, a former lecturer from my art school had her own residency too, so we reconnected and she came to my studio and gave me some sound advice as it was my first time. I'm not sure what I was seeking when I got to Paris, certainly some kind of an experience and a challenge, which I no doubt went away with. It was difficult to make art when the Picasso Museum was up the road, five minutes away, and the Pompidou Centre is ten minutes away. I spent many a night in the Pompidou library, pouring over art books in silence, it was wonderful. What I mean is, that so many things pulled me away from my work, the thrill of visiting museums and walking the streets.
CB: I wouldn't be able to concentrate on a thing. How long did it take you to get rolling with your work?
LA: well even logistics were a big challenge – like how do I get to the other side of town? How do I read the labels on a can of soup in the grocery store? I took home a carton of Pampelmousse hoping it was orange juice...it turned out to be grapefruit juice. I didn't make anything significant in Paris. It's what I took away with me that was important. I started a new series when i got back to Sydney called 'The Paris Paintings'. I made some paintings in the Paris studio, but they failed to capture a consistency that I’d hoped for.
CB: So your Paris Series were all began and finished in Australia?
LA: Yes...
LA: Yes, that is understandable because they have such an effect on the artist. It is always the artist, and I mean all kinds of artists, that really take notice of things and see things in a different way, visually, emotionally. I remember so much from that Paris trip. It is saturated in my brain. And I still use that information when I need it.
CB: It's like jet lag for creativity, isn't it?
LA: Absolutely.
CB: Like it wasn't able to do its job on site.
LA: I think it takes time to absorb it all. It resonates when you get back home. The first of my Paris Series were the drawings, starting with Paris Street Map. I was quite disturbed that I'd gotten back to Sydney and hadn't worked very much in my studio for a month, so i sat on the floor and just started drawing and drawing, and that is the series that began and moved on to paintings on canvas.
CB: Who were your influences there?
LA: For the Paris Series?
CB: Yes.
LA: I would have to say Braque and Picasso were big influences while I was in Paris. Their use of brown during the cubist period really excited me...it had an antiquated look to it that felt so good. I had to use it myself.
CB: Now this is your second residency in SFO?
LA: First in San Francisco.
CB: On your prior visits, did you anticipate your eventual return to work on your art?
LA: Yes, or at least I knew I would rent a studio. I had planned to come here, find a place to live and rent a studio. When I got here I happened on Root Division and they were interested in my work and offered me a studio residency for 6 months. Actually, they would usually have a one year contract but my American visa is only 6 months and RD made an exception for me.
CB: Paris is potentially a vast subject. Let me back up...Is there anything else you'd like to add about your stay in Paris?
LA: It can't be compared to my residency here. It was such a different feeling being in a foreign country and not speaking the language – it is a vast topic. Needless to say there was amazing art and incredible experiences around every corner. But it was tough at times too, setting your own agenda. I wasn't prepared for that. I learned much on that trip...quite unforgettable. It very much prepared me for this residency. Now, I have more practical sense in that I have a set program with things to do. I allow myself to explore the city, but I must also be in the studio at least 5 days a week.
CB: I won't ask you about specifics of what you're doing right now, other than the fact you've been influenced by the architecture there – it's often a matter of reflection when you return home – but is there anything you're finding this time in SFO that brings out an immediate response that must be applied to canvas sooner rather than later?
LA: I keep finding that I am a very tactile person. I love surfaces, bumpy surfaces, things you can touch – so just the experience of being in a different city allows my senses to be nourished in that way. I touch the sides of buildings as I go by. I get familiar with my surroundings that way. So how does this effect my work? I make sure that the surface of my paintings reflect the softness of the architecture I am looking at, or if I add some wood collage, it resembles the built environment in some way.
CB: Along the lines of some of your mixed media work...
LA: Yes, much like the mixed media work I did for the ‘Rauschen-burger To Go’ series.
CB: If you could take back a barge full of material to work with back home, what would you take with you, and what would you make?
LA: Oh gosh, I have found so many art materials here that I like, certain paints, canvas pliers, all workers materials. I think I can pretty much get most things in Australia but I do think I'll take back lots of magazines for collage material, American stuff that you just can't get back home. I'm sure I'd make more mixed media works with them.
CB: Are you working with mixed media quite a bit now?
LA: When I first got here, I didn't use any mixed media; I was just painting my geometric abstracts. But I felt I needed to add more dimension to the works. One thing about my practice is that I can't sit still. I like to try different things or slip back to a style I was practicing ten years ago. So now I am adding some 3D relief to the paintings.
CB: Where are you getting your materials? I mean, are you finding them, purchasing them?
LA: The relief collage?
CB: Yes...
LA: I have been purchasing cord, wood, thread etc., and there is some left over wood in the workroom at the studio that I take before it gets recycled....haven't found much on the streets yet that took my fancy.
CB: Did you start off doing abstract or did you work in any other genres?
LA: My very first experiences in art were portraits and realist landscape paintings, then I moved onto abstracting those forms, and then finally non objective art. I was more into the feeling of the work. It had to take me elsewhere...that's what i was interested in, going someplace else. And that is what I got from looking at artists such as Motherwell and Rauschenberg.
CB: Was there a pivotal point in your schooling where a teacher took you aside and said, “Lila, you're an artist. Have you ever considered doing this as a career?"
LA: No, never. I was driven to be an artist. It was and is what I love. It wasn't a question of doing it as a career, it was just a question of doing it and not stopping.

Trucks get their own FAST lane
Trucks heading into the United States at the Pacific Highway port of entry are getting their own expedited entry system to ease congestion. However, like the NEXUS program at that port, it won�t really be effective until the British Columbia government adds extra lanes to the highway leading to border crossing.
As the NEXUS program does for cars and travelers, the Free And Secure Trade (FAST) program is aimed at speeding up commercial border-crossers by separating the probably good from the potentially bad. �We want to expedite low-risk merchandise and drivers so we can take a good long look at the unknown,� Customs representative Debbie Engels said.
Engels said they have signed up several dozen drivers and carriers and application forms are available at the Pacific Highway Customs office. While NEXUS focuses on who�s travelling in a vehicle, both trucks and drivers need clearance for FAST participation.
For a truck to use the FAST lane the shipper, the carrier and the driver will all need to be pre-cleared. The party shipping the goods will need to be certified under the new Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, created under the December 2001 Smart Border Accord between the U.S. and Canada. �They need to give us information regarding the security of their facility,� Engels said. The carrier or trucking company will need to be enrolled in both C-TPAT and FAST, and participating vehicles will be inspected and mounted with a transponder to identify it to inspectors before it gets to the booth. Finally, drivers will need to be enrolled in the FAST program and be issued a radio-tagged identification card. �It�s very similar to the NEXUS card,� Engels said.
When a FAST shipment heads for the border, invoices for the goods on board are faxed to a customs broker in advance marked with a barcode. The broker transmits the information to customs for pre-arrival clearance and when the shipment arrives at the border the inspector matches the barcode on the invoice the driver is carrying with the one in his system. If it all matches up � shipper, driver, truck and shipment pre-cleared in the system � the shipment rolls across.
�What we�re doing is cutting out a few steps,� Engels said. �The driver doesn�t have to park, walk over to the broker, wait for paperwork, then wait in line.� The pre-clearance system has already been in place for several months in Blaine and is now being integrated with FAST.
As the program gets rolling FAST participants will wait in line with other commercial border-crossers, but because they will be faster to process the hope is all traffic will move a little quicker. All three primary inspection lanes have already been equipped for FAST entries.
�Once we have enough participants enrolled we�ll want that dedicated lane,� Engels said. With only two lanes for trucks leading to the inspection booths, she said they could not afford to take up one for the new system and squeeze all the regular traffic into one lane. �If we have one FAST lane and only one regular lane we�ll still have backups,� Engels said.
Engels said that, until the British Columbia ministry of transport expanded highway infrastructure leading up to the port it made little sense to establish a dedicated FAST lane. However, the wait shouldn�t be long. In November the Canadian and B.C. transportation authorities announced over $25 million would be spent improving border access in the next four years.
�We�ve got a long list of strategic highway infrastructure projects,� said B.C. ministry of transport Grant Smith. On the list are $8.6 million in improvements to the Highway 99/8th Avenue; $7.2 million to expand 8th Avenue to four lanes from the freeway to highway 15; and $3 million to improve the highway leading to the port of entry and add dedicated lanes for the NEXUS and the FAST programs.
Smith said there was not yet a set timeline for the projects. �They still have to go to design and depending on the complexity of the job it�s hard to nail that down,� he said.

Natalie Sutinen has moved on in her work with the immediate, magical object. In the exhibition In between sleep and sleep, works are shown from an ongoing study of time, where the artist discontinues a logical chronology on behalf of the irrational, and creates a room where time is movement.
Time becomes a wet slippery soap in the hand. Incomprehensible traces, memories and dreams are gathered in floating grey zones. In the images and artefacts there are remains of faded generations. Previous pleasures and gravities live on in a dark or light coloured hair, under closed eyes, in a wing or in a feather. Here we find reminders of destinies and persons who no longer are available to tell us the truth about the past. At the same time it is like you somehow know anyway.

We’ve had a nice little chat with two fellow music heads Tod Louie & Solaris… The boys have just started a very cool club concept in Oslo called Echo. They have both been organising parties for a while and are both very experienced DJs, and their new weekly concept has quickly proven itself to be very good quality! They have mixed it up nicely with local and international bookings, Shari & Vari loves their enthusiasm for music and their friendly approach to the scene. Vari is playing alongside these guys tomorrow night (27/4) at Bollywood Dancing! So now you know where to to spend your Friday nights…
What are you doing right now?
Tod Louie: Actually I’m in taking a break from looking up some new tracks. The Word Championship of Snooker is running on Eurosport, which is not to miss. Once you first start following it it’s really addictive in combination to the Norwegian commentator Torstein “TrickWik” WIk. You should check it out! Besides that I’m picking out some new tracks for the weekend at Bollywood. I’m really looking forward to play with Vari again.
Solaris: Living in Oslo and working for a marketing company. I also have my studio here, and most of my friends, and Dj gigs. As far as it goes! At the moment, I’m working on our (with Tod Louie) weekly concept ECHO at Bollywood Dancing, which is turning out pretty nice. We have some amazing bookings lined up for the coming Fridays, including Deniz Kurtel live In May. We are also doing “Det Gode Selskab” (In Good Company) on some selected Sundays as well as on some selected Mondays. These events will take place at secret locations, and at Fisk & Vilt.
Who are your musical heroes?
Tod Louie: Hard question.. My father is a pianist and built a big stage in his backyard throwing everything from swing festivals to techno parties. Got to admire that. But beside from that my musical influences varies from funk, disco, Chicago house to more deep, classic house. If I should pick one artist that is my musical hero I got to say Nina Simone. And my all time favorite is her track, Sinnerman! There’s so much good music out there, and my sets got a little bit from many genres. A bit eclectic, if you know what I mean?
Solaris: I would say there are 100 of them, but to scale it down I will pick out a few special ones. Music wise – Van Morrison, Pink Floyd, LTJ Bukem, Fleetwood Mac, Nightmares On Wax, Otis Redding and Lucien N Luciano. – DJ wise : Steve Bug, Zip and Four Tet.
Whats on repeat at the moment?
Tod Louie: I’ve found an old track from Joubert Singers called Stand On The Word. I think it has been remixed by Larry Levan as well. But this new remix from Hot Coins is a real smasher! Really funky, and its bass lines will definitely make an impression on the dance floor! Its quite slow, 105BPM. But if you can keep the BPM around 105-110 for a while, and then suddenly drop that song!.. That’s whats great being a Dj.
Solaris: There are defiantly a few tracks on repeat, but there are two tracks that stands out for me in my Dj sets, and that is ; Portable – One Way feat. Efdemin and DJ Slip – Available Light (Franco Cinelli Remix). Besides this I’m always listening to Van Morrison. You should all check out one of the most essential albums of all times – Astral Weeks from 1968. Stunning! See you at ECHO 27.04.2012 with Solaris, Tod Louie and wonder guest Vari

Spring is here and so is HEAT #3, Friday April 6 @ Chez Moune (Paris). This time we have a very special German guest… Our friend, the very talented, ridiculously funky and not to mention super sweet, Marc Liebe aka MALIBEE (Dench Disko/Frankfurt). He’ll be playing alongside me (Shari) and our HEAT resident HEKO (that Frenchman that can mix like a demon, make a cake and talk on the phone all at the same time)…! ;-)
Come one, come many! What can you expect? Sore feet! Dancing imminent. ;-)

Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson (81) waves to the fans after an NFL football game against the Atlanta Falcons at Ford Field in Detroit, Saturday, Dec. 22, 2012. (AP Photo/Rick Osentoski)
ALLEN PARK — In the NFL there’s something magical about the elite 2,000-yard club.
Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders ran for 2,053 yards in 1997. He’s one of only six running backs in NFL history to reach the 2,000-yard mark.
On Sunday against the Chicago Bears, Calvin Johnson could become the first NFL receiver with 2,000 receiving yards in a season. He broke Jerry Rice’s all-time record on Saturday night. Now he just needs 108 yards to reach 2,000.
<>/p>
“That would be big, kind of almost put that thing away for a while,’’ Johnson said on Thursday. “All records are meant to be broken, but that’d make it tough.
“It’d take a long time for somebody to come and get that. You never know what could happen next year, but it’d be a tough one, you’ve got to put in a lot of work to get that,’’ said Johnson who would know.
Rice’s record had stood since 1995 and there have been plenty of top wide receivers come and go in the NFL since then.
“He’s taken it up another notch every year, he’s taken it up maybe a couple this year,’’ Lions offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said. “He’s had to pick up the slack for some guys missing, he gladly does it. It’s so impressive what he does, but it’s more impressive the way he goes about his business. I think that’s what sets him apart from a lot of other guys.’’ Continued...
Coach Jim Schwartz certainly would never take anything away from Johnson, but because of the way the game has changed offensive records may not last as long as they have in the past.
“Teams aren’t afraid to throw 50 times a game. It used to be you throw it 50 times a game because you’re losing and have to catch up,’’ Schwartz said. “But you see teams all over the league now that throw it a bunch of time and score a lot of points. The league is constantly changing. I don’t know how long any record, offensively in particular, can stand. Receivers catch a lot more balls, it’s just the way it is.’’
If Johnson reaches the 2,000-yard mark on Sunday, perhaps he will be the one to surpass it in seasons down the road.
Schwartz thinks the 27-year-old Johnson is just scratching the surface.
“When it’s all said and done we’re not going to be talking about this being the highlight of his career,’’ Schwartz said. “He’s going to do some great things.
Johnson and Matthew Stafford got off to a bit of a slow start this season. In the Lions’ 13-7 Oct. 22 loss at Chicago, Johnson had his least productive game of the season with just three catches for 34 yards.
That could make the 2,000-yard mark tougher to reach on Sunday at Ford Field. The Bears passing defense is tied for sixth-best in the NFL.
“They’ve been playing that Cover 2 system that they have since they’ve been there. They do real well with that and Cover 3 and you know disguise it,’’ Johnson said. “They do a great job of their safeties and bringing them down real late. In film we see they haven’t done it much, but for some reason when we see them they do a lot of disguising.
That reason could be one Calvin Johnson.
“It’s not that it makes it harder, there are some opportunities we missed,’’ Johnson said. “But they do a good job. We play them twice a year so they kind of know us inside and out like we know them.’’ Continued...
One of Johnson’s attributes is he can play at any receiver position. We will see that again on Sunday against the Bears.
“We’ve still got to let the game come to us. They’re going to need more attention on him with our receiving depth the way it is. If you’re not going to get attention going into the last week then you’re never going to get it,’’ Linehan said. “So I just think we go through the game, guys have to be good around him. I think he’ll still have a productive game, the way he’s locked in.’’
Johnson has averaged 156.7 yards over the last eight games. He’s had 100-plus yards in each game with two games of 200-plus yards.
He was named to the Pro Bowl as the Lions lone representative this week.
“That’s the biggest slam-dunk in Pro Bowl balloting,’’ Schwartz said. “We’re proud of him, we’re proud that he represents us, we’re proud when he’s on the field on Sund.

“Sometimes you get an idea, you get into the (rehearsal) studio the next day, and you shoot it the NEXT day,” he says. “Choreograph, shoot it, move on the next one.”
It all makes for a dazzling experience to watch. Elaborate production numbers are organically integrated into a melodramatic yet complex storyline. And unlike many eye-poppingly visual series, “Smash” can’t rely on souped-up computer graphics.
“CGI is kind of easier,” says Jack Davenport, noting that CGI post-production is handed off to its own team of specialists to complete. “We have to do all our staging for real — an hour of television every eight days.”
With a little down time before his next scene, Davenport is chilling in his trailer dressing room, parked outside the theater on W. 176th Street.
His character has been a party to the series’ realignment, which calls for making things lighter, a little more comic than last year. On the premiere, take a look at how last year’s imperious lady-killer Derek has been humanized in a hilarious musical fantasy: A troupe of sexy women in a bar gang up on him as a mass rebuke to his chauvinist ways, to the tune of the Eurythmics’ “Would I Lie to You?”
But just because “Smash” isn’t scared to have fun doesn’t mean it isn’t close to the truth.
“To the untrained eye it might appear arch, high-camp, kind of over-the-top,” says Davenport with a laugh. “Not in the slightest. This virtually is a documentary.”
Furthermore, he notes, “Smash” is a perfect show for any viewer weary of TVore@ap.org and.

Fifteen aboard the Hartford were injured but returned to duty, according to a news release.
ZUI also this article from the BBC:
The incident is being investigated and damage to both ships is being evaluated, a navy statement said.
The New Orleans' fuel tank was ruptured in the crash, causing a spill of 25,000 gallons (90,000 litres) of diesel.
No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans, according to the statement from the Fifth Fleet, which is based in Bahrain.

What confuses me is that the straits have some of the strongest currents and undertows there. I know that our subs like to go under surface assets all the time, but doing it going through the Straits of Hormuz is downright stupid. Whoever that OOD was....he needs to be crucified to the tree of woe, and the CO along with him.
Remember the Victor class that pulled that off back in the mid-80's going under a cargo ship going through the straits of Gibraltar and it ended up having to get towed back to Murmansk?
This must be a real embarrassment to the Dolphin community.

‘Boardwalk Empire’ Season 3 Teaser: ‘New Year, New Rules’ (VIDEO)
One of my favorite HBO show’s will be back soon, this fall to be exact. “Boardwalk Empire” has released its first Season 3 teaser, and Nucky Thompson is looking like he’s embracing being a ‘gangster’. In the “gangster” that Jimmy Darmody advised him to become during Season 1. Unfortunately, Jimmy won’t be around to reap the benefits after his former mentor put an end to their relationship in the season 2′s finale. Literally.
I can’t wait for season 3.

VIDEO: Chis Braiotta interviews the stars of Superbad
What do you think about the way adults seem obsessed with high-school movies?JH I don’t know, I mean, everyone went through high school and everyone’s got their own high-school experience to talk about. But the people who made Superbad, Seth [Rogen] and Evan [Goldberg], wrote it when they were in high school, so it wasn’t a recounting of high school at the time. It was more just wanting to write a movie about kids like them. The problem with most teen movies is that they’re not movies about teenagers. I was in high school, what, five years ago? And to even watch this movie is really awesome and nostalgic, because it reminds me of what it was like to be there.
What do you feel Superbad captures that other teen movies don’t?
JH Reality.CM-P Friendship.MC Yeah, it’s more about the friendship than this sort of come-and-go thing you might see elsewhere. I’m trying to think of other high-school movies, but I know that the main focus when we were making this, at least from our point of view, was to care about the friendship between the two guys, and the fact that they’re separating.
Do you think that comes out of the script or the direction or the chemistry between you guys?
CM-P All three, really.MC Everything that drives the movie comes from this fear of being apart from your best friend.JH You can’t get away with being vulgar if the emotional story doesn’t work. Otherwise people won’t buy it and they won’t like sitting through it. They’ll listen to you be dirty and funny if they care about your characters. Everyone’s intention was to make this feel like a real friendship, which I think we accomplished.
Jonah, you’re 23. Was there anything you had to change about yourself in order to come across as 18?JH I had to alter the way I carried myself, yeah. That was something Judd and Greg [Mottola, director] and I had talked about — trying to lose some of the confidence I’ve probably gained since being in high school. I moved back in with my parents.

Moved and excited by pianist Leon Fleisher in Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto with the Boston Symphony, I wanted to hear it again. But at 6 pm a week ago Tuesday, Fleisher, with a bad stomach flu, cancelled, and the Austrian/Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti — in town to hear the debut of one of the BSO’s two new assistant conductors, his son Julian — agreed to go on, without rehearsal. I was disappointed — but not for long.
This also became the BSO debut of the 69-year-old Kuerti, a masterful and elegant player who studied with Rudolf Serkin and Mieczyslaw Horszowski and at the Longy School, and who played the first movement of the Grieg Piano Concerto at a children’s concert with the Esplanade Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler a week before his tenth birthday. Fleisher, at 79 still troubled by focal dystonia in his right hand, had to slow down the fast movements and still missed a few notes. (He played “beyond the notes.”) But Kuerti, playing from memory, hit them all, jawdroppingly full speed ahead. His sound is softer-edged than Fleisher’s jewel-like pointedness, but also crystalline, transparent, and so precise that every note is distinguishable, even flying by at hummingbird speed. The Emperor is full of trills, and Kuerti’s are virtually birdlike, rising over gravity before floating downward.
Kuerti doesn’t have Fleisher’s muscularity or heroic sense of drama, but he shares Fleisher’s extraordinary musical continuity. He seemed to play each movement, especially the slow, songful middle movement, in a single breath. His pacing was flawless, especially in Beethoven’s unbroken transition from the inward slow movement to the extroverted, dancing finale, which he plunged into with breathtaking daring.
This was the second consecutive BSO program during which a major soloist had to cancel. The previous week, baritone Thomas Quasthoff sang a set of Schubert songs and then lost his voice. At the remaining concerts he was replaced with the Brahms Serenade the BSO had played the week before.
Meanwhile, Kuerti’s 31-year-old son, who had provided such sympathetic and imaginative support for Fleisher, delivered the same for his father’s very different approach. Surely the BSO will reschedule this memorable pairing, and with some advance notice.
The following week, no one got sick. Italian conductor and Royal Philharmonic music director Daniele Gatti returned to the BSO with Garrick Ohlsson in the Schumann Piano Concerto and closed with Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony. Both were strong if slightly ragged performances. The old seating arrangement and oboist Keisuke Wakao’s unyielding solo work in the Schumann didn’t help. Gatti has a way of micromanaging musical events so that everything sounds impressive in passing — a string of sculpted moments — but nothing adds up. Intensity without continuity. The long slow movement of the Shostakovich seemed endless. Ohlsson was in good form, playing with both delicacy and sweeping power, but he seemed somehow abstract — impersonal and generic — rather than catching Schumann’s interior tug of war.

Atlanta is coming off a 34-0 victory over New York Giants, putting the NFC South champions within a win of earning home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs.
The Falcons, though, showed the previous week just how vulnerable they can be against one of the NFC's worst teams, losing by double digits to the Carolina Panthers.
"You can't just show up if you're going to beat a team," Atlanta tight end Tony Gonzalez said. "Maybe we learned that at Carolina. Maybe that loss was something good for us."
The Falcons (12-2) will find out soon if they learned their lesson.
It would be easy to overlook the lowly Detroit Lions (4-10) because they have lost six straight and were bad enough to lose to Arizona last week 38-10, allowing the Cardinals to end a nine-game slide.
Matt Ryan said the Falcons have too much at stake for a letdown.
"What's still in front of us in terms of the playoff picture and those kind of things, I think is all the motivation we need," Ryan said. "It's not something I worry about."
Atlanta will have some worries on defense Saturday night in Detroit. A pair of players that played college ball in the Peach State, receiver Calvin Johnson and quarterback Matthew Stafford, are the only sources of pride for the Lions and causes of concern for opponents.
Johnson, the first player in league history with 1,600-plus yards receiving in two straight seasons, has matched a league record with 100 yards receiving in seven straight games. He's 182 yards through the air from breaking Jerry Rice's single-season NFL mark.
The humble superstar from Georgia Tech didn't even know, earlier this week, what Rice's record was exactly.
"18-something, 46, maybe?" he asked.
Rice had 1,848 yards receiving with the San Francisco 49ers in 1995 and Johnson is a couple of his average games away from breaking the 1,900-yard mark.
"He's going to get his," Falcons safety Thomas DeCoud said of Johnson. "You always have to be aware of where he is. If we can limit his catches and keep him out of the end zone, we can't let other guys beat us."
If the Falcons let targets other than Johnson make a lot of plays, it would be more embarrassing than losing to Carolina.
Detroit has been without its second, third, and fourth receivers and No. 1 running back, and probably will be without top tight end Brandon Pettigrew against Atlanta because of injuries.
Stafford, like the team he leads, has taken a step back this season a year after spectacular results led to the Lions winning 10 games and ending an 11-year postseason drought.
But the former Georgia star throws so often - putting him on pace to break Drew Bledsoe's single-season record for attempts - and sometimes well enough to rank fourth in the league with 4,252 yards, and to give Johnson a shot to surpass a revered NFL record.
"Anytime I get a chance to, I'm going to try to give him a chance," Stafford said. "That's when our offense is at its best."
Ryan, meanwhile, might have a trio of targets with 1,000-plus yards receiving by the end of the regular season.
Roddy White has already passed the mark for a sixth straight season, and second-year pro Julio Jones has done it. Star tight end Tony Gonzalez is 120 yards away from his first season with 1,000 yards receiving since 2008, his last year with the Kansas City Chiefs. More importantly, they've combined for 22 touchdowns through the air.
"We've got a lot of guys that deserve opportunities to touch the football on our offense," Atlanta coach Mike Smith said. "It gives our offensive coordinator and our quarterback a lot of options when we're putting our game plan together during the week."
Part of the plan for the Falcons in a prime-time matchup in the Motor City is to take a struggling opponent more seriously than they did a couple weeks ago against the Panthers.
"I certainly hope we approach it differently," Smith said. "I believe that we will. This is a very good football team. Their record is not indicative of the type of team they are. Eight of their 10 losses have been by less than one score, so they've played some very close games."
The Lions' last defeat was an exception.
Detroit got routed by the Cardinals, which had lost nine straight, after losing four straight by a TD or less, including an NFL record-tying three games in a row after leading by 10-plus points. A year after playing for postseason positioning in late December, they're relegated to playing for pride.
"We are playing for each other on national TV with a good chance to show the country what type of team we are," Detroit tight end Tony Scheffler said. "The season hasn't gone the way any of us wanted, but to get a showcase game like this against a team fighting for home-field advantage, you couldn't ask for more."

As part of this publication's effort to highlight candidates running in the upcoming municipal election in Fredericton, Mayor Brad Woodside was next up on the list yesterday. He took the time to give his views on topics ranging from what he wants to do for the city if he wins this term, to what he wants his legacy to be when he's done. If Woodside wins in May, it will be his eighth term as Mayor of the City of Fredericton. When asked, after the camera was turned off, if he felt any hint of a coming change of the guard with this election, and perhaps the torch being passed, Woodside replied emphatically, "No." He's in this race to win - again.

TOP TEN: Glam Artists
Delia Sparrow
, September 14th, 2012 08:41
Delia Sparrow counts down her favourite glam artists, in a list with more glimmer than you could rotate a disco ball at
I like glam. But my boyfriend really likes glam. So I’ve heard a lot of glam... Some mornings I wake up because thud thud double thud – it’s the 2 Glitter Band drummers whacking tribal-shimmers out of their kits... or the cats are sent flying by the slithering shiny guitar triumphs of Sweet or Hector. So by osmosis – glamosis if you will be so cheesy - this is a top ten of the glam and glam-informed ("hey pop song! Did you hear that Gary Glitter track last week? How about adding some stomps & a ‘hey’ vocal breakdown to our fine ditty?")
*With tunes played into my ears and facts drummed into my head courtesy of Tim Purr.
Pantherman
Who could resist a mad producer from the Netherlands clad in black leather from his boots to the tippy-tops of his cat-eared mask? Clutching a little ceramic panther in his crazed paws... with lyrics promising “I am your Panther man – I’ll show you my paws... show you my CLAWS! I’M GONNA BITE YOU!” How can you resist his seductive snarl? Restless prowling guitars urge this feline performer onwards to a not very prolific output (3 singles I believe) but what furry greatness!
Bogdan/Billy Hamon
There are rules for glam. You can define glam by things like...
how many drummers the band has, how the bands dress (How many stacks do those platform boots have, Horace?), is there a drums and vocals middle 8? Does it go ‘hey!’ (with the rest of the band going ‘hey’ back?) And so on. And some songs/performers are indefinably and magically glam. Bogdan is one of them. Apart from playing a dysfunctional teenager in ‘Please Sir’ he released odd stuttering pop classics such as ‘Butch Things’ and of course ‘Oh Eddie’ with lazily magnificent twangy guitar solo and lyrics about teachers being mean to you in school when you just want to be a rock’n’roller...
Dump
A classic name for a glam band! One word names were quite the rage in the early 70s – Hector, Ginger, Kipper, Catapult... - possibly because they’d look better on a badge in a great bubble font. Anyway, Dump - a strange little squat man, dumpy in fact - prances around in dungarees and scary yeti hair singing about the lovely Annabelle while their cross-dressing pianist vamps his way through the rock opera-esque classic-that-should-have-been.
Sailor
This one was actually a hit (sorry junkshop purists). A concept group with songs about... sailing, and other nautical stuff! Playing with their Nickleodeon, a synth/piano/glockenspiel monster with a player on either side, and great harmonies this is one of my favourite songs. While I was looking for a good video to paste here I found out you can actually still book this band! Pop fact: a member of Sailor is married to one of Pan’s People! This is possibly why their new stage show includes dances choreographed by Dee Dee from Pan’s People.
Lieutenant Pigeon
Not my favourite band of the 70s (sorry...) but possibly the only one that had their mum in the band, giving hope to all ‘I’ll keep rocking til I’m dead’ rock mums and dads everywhere... ‘Mouldy Old Dough’ was their hit: a boogie-woogie instrumental with a penny whistle and featuring a gurning ma on second piano, while the band giggled their way through Top Of The Pops. Also known for releasing an album of train noises. Also known as Stavely Makepeace.
Mr Big
Sadly with a name now sullied by the not quite as good (ahem!) 80s pretenders, this fine bundle of chaps were led by the rough-hewn majesty of Dicken. A raggle-taggle muddle of chaps coming across like a bunch of Dickensian gangsters posing as choirboys – it’s a kind of low-rent but high-class take on 'Bohemian Rhapsody' with falsetto harmonies and glimmering majesty from a bricklayers' choir.
Chicory Tip
It’s good to dress up. And even those who get it wrong sometimes get it extremely right. Looking more like mutant super-heroes from another planet than pop stars, Chicory Tip had a hit with Giorgio Moroder’s 'Son Of My Father', with a rocking synth sound. Some of my favourite glam is synthy glam: the shock of the new with the stomp of the old. Like the cavemen in 2001 managed to break into the spaceship and make some tunes with HAL. I have to mention the dog connection here too: Chicory Tip sounded like The Association or Fifth Dimension until they found Giorgio’s 'Son Of My Father' and then they went all rocking synth-glam-tastic. That they also seem to have appropriated some of his dogs on record sleeves is good style (see above). This can only be a good thing.
Catapult
Big collars, glitter, racks of synths, dance routines, rock poses, the flaxen locks of Rubberen Robbie their smiley singer. 'Let Your Hair Hang Down (Hey Gather Round!)' and 'Teeny Bopper Band' are both great pop songs with a classic ‘Nederglam’ (the Netherlands had so many glam bands they get their own sub-section!) beat.
Also look out for Mabel (a Danish gang of Rod Stewart-a-likes) and Lemming (Dutch goth-tinged - yes, really - glam who often had a half-naked lady tempting the pouting singer).
Ricky Wilde
Rock’n’roll, rock’n’roll, who loves rock’n’roll? Well actually the Rock’n’Roll Children do with big kiddy choirs and hand-clappy enthusiasm. And in the 70s they seemed to love kids in bands... The James Boys doing manic dance routines to bubblegum pop, Darren Burn singing choirboy stompy pop, but mostly Ricky Wilde (son of Marty, brother of Kim) singing Quatro-esque rock like 'Teen Wave' as well as my favourite, 'I Am An Astronaut'. Pop fact: Ricky’s dad Marty re-invented himself in the 70s, too, as a sort of glam bike superhero ‘Zappo’.
Kipper
Sadly Kipper aren’t real. They were the musical stars of 70s sex (well – some short skirts and wobbly cleavages) comedy Confessions of A Pop Performer featuring the horribly unsexy Robin Askwith. Kipper were a leery, nasty bovver-boy boogie-glam monster fronted by glam-nightmare Nutter Normington. This band are so great they even have a fanclub. And as a glam farewell, sing-a-long-a ‘Do The Clapham’:
“Find a partner that's half your size
/ Then thump 'er right between the eyes /
And if you're bored and you want a larf
/ Kick a few members of the catering staff”
.

Why is this in the news section rather than, oh, features or something? I'm easily confused, don'tcha know.
Sep 17, 2012 7:35am
In reply to Johnny Nothing:
Well, we're long overdue a site overhaul, which we've been saving up for, for over two years now, which will basically give us more sections amongst other things. Until that time we're kind of hamstrung by only being able to put up three features a day without stuff getting lost, which is why we also put up feature content at the weekends. So simply by default, shorter features and newsier features go in news.

The Real Estate Helpers News
WARNING to Home Owners [VIDEO]
This four minute video exposes the ugly truth about real estate advertising, the agents involved, and a warning about the authorities real estate agents want you to sign to allow them to sell your home. Agents can now claim rights over the title of your property …
Here’s what happens
1. A real estate agent lies about the selling price of your property.
2. You choose the agent based on the price they told you.
3. Then, you agree to pay the real estate agent (thousands of dollars!) for real estate advertising.
One home seller wept as she told us about the agent they hired to sell their home. He told them $600,000 was “easily achievable”. But their property passed in for $510,000 at auction. This a common complaint about real estate agents.
… if the agent had told us the truth we would never of put our property on the market …
Unfortunately this is a typical example of how home sellers pay for agents lies. In this case the advertising bill was $6,000.
Discover how real estate agents can place a caveat on your property
Imagine you sign with an agent after they tell you your property is going to sell for $900,000. “No problem” says the real estate agent “We’ll definitely get that price. But in order to achieve that result we need $10,000 dollars in advertising”.
Your real estate agent is certain the price they told you is achievable, so you go for it. Fast forward three months. Your property hasn’t sold. Now your agent tells you your house is now going to sell for a lot less than what he told you at the start. Understandably, you’re not happy. Because now you realise they lied to you from the start.
Now you want to change agents, but can’t without first paying the huge advertising bill. We call this process ‘handcuffing’ – home sellers are effectively handcuffed to and agent they don’t trust and don’t like.
How to remove a caveat

13.11 – Welcome to Salthill. It was frosty this morning out in the west, but conditions are now ideal. Injuries have impacted on Brian Cody’s team selection, but the Black and Amber still field a starting XV studded with classy hurlers. There is experience in every line, but significant interest surrounds how Conor Fogarty, Lester Ryan, and Tom Breen will fare.
For the locals the stationing of Joseph Cooney at centre back dominates the pre match conversations. Anthony Cunningham, Mattie Kenny, and Tom Helebert steered Galway back to respectability in 2012, but remaining at the top table will be a monumental challenge.
In attack Jonathan Glynn, who impressed in his Championship cameos last year, will be hoping to exhibit his ball winning prowess again. The Ardrahan youngster is adept in the air. How Glynn performs will be worth monitoring.
13.41 –
13.42 –
13.46 – A decent crowd is gathering at Pearse Stadium. Galway want to build on last year’s encouraging campaign, but they face a real test in the Salthill sun.
13.55 – One late change on the Kilkenny team. Eoin Larkin starts instead of Michael Fennelly.
14.05 – Galway 0-1 Kilkenny 0-0: 3 mins – Aidan Harte has struck the first point of the game. Lively start with two splendid clearances from Joseph Cooney in the early stages.
14.07 – Galway 0-2 Kilkenny 0-1: 5 mins – It is moving along at a nice clip here in Salthill. Joe Canning (free) and Richie Power have traded scores.
14.12 – Galway 0-2 Kilkenny 0-2: 11 mins – It is very tight in the early stages in the west. Richie Hogan has just landed a free from 63 metres to level it up.
14.17 – Goal for Galway!
14.18 – A second goal for Galway in 90 seconds!
14.20 – Galway 2-3 Kilkenny 0-4: 17 mins – The Tribesmen have pounced for two goals inside 90 seconds. Joe Canning deliveries created the two goals which were bagged by Davy Glennon and Niall Healy. An interesting first quarter.
14.22 – Galway 2-4 Kilkenny 0-5: 20 mins – Richie Hogan and Joe Canning swap frees and then Richie Power converts one from an acute angle.
14.31 – Galway 2-4 Kilkenny 0-7: 24 mins – Kilkenny have hit three points on the spin including a beauty from Tommy Walsh to trim the deficit.
14.33 – Galway 2-4 Kilkenny 0-9: 31 mins – Make that five points in a row from the Cats with Richie Hogan and Lester Ryan leaving only the minimum in it.
14.34 – Goal for Galway!
14.37 – Galway 3-4 Kilkenny 0-9: 34 mins – The third Galway goal was scored in the 32nd minute and it was all about Portumna. Again Canning was the creator and on this occasion Damien Hayes converted. After controlling Canning’s sharp cross field pass Hayes skipped away from Tommy Walsh before rattling the Kilkenny net.
14.39 – Half-time: Galway 3-4 Kilkenny 0-10: An Aidan Fogarty point ends the opening period scoring. Galway have been fairly clinical converting chances inside and that is why they leave at the interval protecting a three point lead.
14.48 – Galway 3-4 Kilkenny 0-10: It is very early in the year, but this has been a decent game in Salthill. Galway are fortunate to be ahead, but they have been efficient converting goal chances. Kilkenny have offered glimpses of class, particularly Richie Power, who has enjoyed a productive outing hurling plenty of ball at centrefield.
14.54 – Teams are back on the field in Salthill. Game has resumed.
14.58 – Galway 3-4 Kilkenny 0-11: 39 mins- Richie Hogan taps over a routine free as Kilkenny move to within two points of Galway again.
15.00 – Galway 3-4 Kilkenny 0-11: 41 mins – It has been a scrappy start to the second half. Richie Hogan has missed a scoreable free for the Cats.
15.02 – Galway 3-4 Kilkenny 0-11: 44 mins -Hogan surprisingly misses another free seconds after Davy Glennon was denied a fourth Galway goal by Kilkenny custodian Eoin Murphy.
15.05 – Galway 3-5 Kilkenny 0-11: 47 mins – Galway finally register a second half score courtesy of a nice Damien Hayes point on the run.
15.07 – Galway 3-6 Kilkenny 0-11: 48 mins- Joe Canning has nailed his fourth free of the afternoon from distance to edge Galway further ahead.
15.08 – Galway 3-6 Kilkenny 0-12: 49 mins – Aidan Fogarty has landed a fine score for Kilkenny, who have introduced Mark Kelly for Tom Breen.
15.10 – Galway 3-8 Kilkenny 0-12: 51 mins – Joe Canning rifles over another free and it is quickly followed by a tidy effort from Davy Glennon.
15.13 – Galway 3-8 Kilkenny 0-13: 54 mins – Richie Power scores a free for the Cats, who are still very much in this contest despite leaking three first half goals.
15.14 – Galway 3-9 Kilkenny 0-13: 55 mins – David Collins has just drilled over a delightful score for Galway, who are five ahead with 15 minutes remaining.
15.18 – Galway 3-9 Kilkenny 0-14: 58 mins- Richie Power blasts over a free after Kevin Hynes fouled Colin Fennelly.
15.20 – Galway 3-9 Kilkenny 0-15: 60 mins – A drop of controversy here. Referee Diarmuid Kirwan somehow didn’t award a free out to Galway and then Kilkenny were given a soft one which Richie Power converted. The locals aren’t too happy!
15.22 – Galway 3-10 Kilkenny 0-15: 62 mins – Joe Canning bangs over a 65, but Eoin Larkin responds with a point for play seconds after Galway custodian Fergal Flannery denied Richie Hogan.
15.23 – Five minutes left Galway lead by four.
15.26 – Galway 3-11 Kilkenny 0-17: 67 mins – Joseph Cooney scores a classy point for Galway, but a Richie Power free brings Kilkenny to within a goal of the Maroons.
15.29 – Galway 3-11 Kilkenny 0-17: 69 mins- Seconds remain, will Galway hold on?
15.31 – Galway win by three in Salthill.
15.34 – Full-time: Galway 3-11 Kilkenny 0-17 - It wasn’t a classic by the Corrib, but that won’t bother Galway manager Anthony Cunningham. The Tribesmen pocketed the spoils and at this stage of the year that is what truly matters. Joseph Cooney was a standout performer for the locals, who face Clare in Ennis in a fortnight. Kilkenny go to Thurles on Saturday week. Already that looks a crunch Division 1A fixture.
15.41 –
Scorers for Galway: Joe Canning 0-6 (5fs, 165), (4fs), Aidan Fogarty 0-2, Tommy Walsh 0-1, Lester Ryan 0-1, Eoin Larkin 0-1.

My name is Jeremy. I run The Session. If you need any help, let me know.
Here are some house rules and frequently asked questions..
How do I become a member?
When you sign up to become a member, you will be asked to give your name and email address, and choose a password.
You can then use the combination of your name and password to log?
Sure. Just log in and go to your member profile. You will see options there for changing any of your details..
Can I submit an alternate setting of a tune that’s already listed?
Yes. Log in. Go to the tune and click on the “Add a setting” button.
Why is there no tune category for slow airs?.?
Every member of The Session can edit the details of sessions, events, recordings and tunes, regardless of who first submitted it. If you see an inaccurate or incomplete listing, go ahead and edit it. You’ll need to log in first.
A session is no longer active. How do I delete it?
You don’t. Instead, log in and add a comment explaining that the session is no longer active. Also, update the schedule so that no days are selected.
It is far, far more useful for people to be able to find information on a defunct session than to find no information at all.
I still have questions. What should I do?.

For the first time ever, a few people in my Mom’s family have asked that we organize a time to get together to take a look at my family history information! So I’ve spent a couple of days trying to get my stuff into a more entertaining format that might “hook” me some more information. I will be giving them a Word print out of a 3 generation timeline/narrative format of my notes with as many maps, photographs and certificate images as I could reasonably put in there. I have information from my great-great grandparents births to my grandparents deaths. I also included a lot of pictures of my mom and her siblings growing up hoping to jog some memories out of my aunts and uncles.
It’s a 30 page, color coded, sources cited wonder to behold! (Well, at least to me!) We’re getting together tomorrow and it will be interesting to see the reaction and to see if they are interested in seeing more details or more generations. A warm-up for the DVD project to come!
Wish me luck!!
How exciting! Fingers crossed you hook a few. Let us know what happens!
Hoping to hear wonderous tales about the “fish that was caught”!

What a great story! What a fun time. Bacon trumps all…..especially with fresh pineapple. I did, once, make the HUGE mistake of grilling chicken kabobs with fresh pineapple on the same skewer as the meat. The lag time before cooking resulted in disasterously mushy chicken because of the enzymes in the fresh pineapple. Very cool of Char-Broil to set up such a great event.
YOU ARE JUST SO BRIGHT AND BRAVE! I’d have wet my pants , given that combination of ingredients!
I ate two – just sayin’
Loved hearing about your contest. Better luck next time but I think honorable mention is still good.
It’s hard not to love bacon covered anything. We’ll take the second place.

Scripts are Like a Loaded Gun
Everything Looks Like a Target When You Have a Gun
Congratulations! Through ingenuity or skill with using your programming language of choice or your favorite search engine you are now in possession of a script that you can use to make all your performance tuning problems vanish in an instant. Be sure to kick it off whenever you need to; and use the results to instantly make important tuning decisions in your production database environment. <–Sarcasm, folks!
Having code to use and understanding it’s usage are two different things entirely. Unless you’re lucky in troubleshooting and Russian Roulette, not understanding there is a difference leads to making bad decisions with bad – or even correct – information.
A Little Something for the SQL Geeks
While this applies to all programming disciplines I am going to use Microsoft SQL Server’s programming language and engine as an example due to my familiarity. Let’s talk about the fine art of waiting for a second…
When I present for user groups, at technical summits, or on SQL Cruise I frequently do so on the subject of SQL Server’s Dynamic Management Objects. These are internal code constructs that allow for advanced troubleshooting and analysis of what is going on under the covers in your SQL Servers. One of the more useful DMOs (as they’re referred to) is sys.dm_os_wait_stats. Without getting into the nitties and gritties of what this DMO is and how to call it (for those of you not versed in SQL Server) let’s talk instead of the data it offers up to those who use it.
It’s Like Marriage
Sure marriage is full of unicorns dancing in fields of marshmallow-coated bacon where it rains chocolate-covered cherries and money grows on trees but it is also about waiting. Waiting for him to find his car keys for the 5th time this month. Waiting for her to choose the right black dress from the 19 she owns. Waiting for him to finish that last match of Halo multiplayer. Waiting for her to finish that last section of code and log off the computer for the night.
The good spouse or partner accepts these things as the overhead to a successful, lasting marriage. The alternative is that you keep a running tally sheet in your head
That was the 8th time this month she had to try on little black dresses while I’m waiting in the car… a total of 40 minutes! That’s an average of 5 minutes!
If he starts up another game of Halo he’s going to have to learn how to toss a grenade by pressing on his left testicle where I’m planning on shoving that controller. That is the 7th time this week!
You get the idea. Microsoft SQL Server does the exact same thing. Not performing outpatient surgery to insert XBox controllers into the lower GI tract of gamers, but rather keeping track of when it needs to wait for something. This is the crux of what wait stats are. By querying the sys.dm_os_wait_stats DMO though a great script that I’ve discussed here and others have created, refined, altered, and tuned elsewhere as well you can get a great idea of where to start tuning things when you get that dreaded (at non-informative) call from a user stating “the database is slow.” Cue the screeching music and tighten the tension, that phone call will come eventually…
The Call Is Coming from Inside the Office!
Typically the call is short on information; no idea what the database name or server is perhaps, or if the performance issues are related to a given process. Once all that is ironed out where do you begin? The issue could be a poorly performing query or a constraint on resources or, well, ANYTHING!
Scripts Don’t Replace Years of Expertise and Experience
The first place I start once I am at this stage is with the wait stats query that shows up on multiple blogger sites. Here is the flavor of it I pulled from Glenn Berry with SQLskills. I had the pleasure of working with him on my book on the subject we’re discussing now and he really understands performance diagnostics.
What Glenn’s script does is identify the top waits that SQL has accumulated since the last time the wait stats were cleared via issuing the DBCC SQLPERF(‘sys.dm_os_wait_stats’, CLEAR); command or by cycling the SQL Services. This is a key thing to understand – these waits are not permanently accumulating – they are transitory and it’s important to understand how much metadata you’re basing your decisions on rather than blindly placing your trust in the data displayed on the screen in front of you. The waits also don’t take into consideration routine maintenance and backups as well as perhaps single – expensive tasks that may not represent the true current workload causing issues on the SQL Server. The wait stats cover all the activity that has accumulated over time.
Performance Tuning Scripts Can Be Powerful, but Dangerous
It’s critical that when you download a script to resolve a particular issue, you have faith in the source of that script (expertise) and you also understand it’s use and what it does (and does not) tell you. After all a loaded gun is a dangerous thing in and of itself, but is quite a powerful tool in the hands of a trained professional.
Do you want to get more SQL Server training with a side of fun, networking, and rejuvenation? Then join me in 2013 for SQL Cruise 2013!
Hi Tim,
Nice write up and very interesting imagination specially about the surgery to insert game controller.

The name of the disease sounds like just another clinical term: Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis. But the experience of the disease sounds like the premise of a psychological thriller: A healthy young woman has everything going for her -- a promising career, an active social life -- until suddenly, she starts feeling "off." She's moody, she's paranoid; she becomes convinced her apartment is infested with bedbugs and her boyfriend is having an affair ... soon, the seizures and hallucinations begin. Before long she's hospitalized, appearing "possessed, crying or laughing hysterically one moment and turning catatonic the next." Doctors prescribe antipsychotics for what they assume is some form of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
But Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis isn't a mental illness at all. It's a recently discovered auto immune disease that strikes mostly young women and is decribed as having one's "brain on fire."
That's what happened to Susannah Calahan, New York Times best-selling author of "Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness." The disease is treatable; though not curable -- Calahan was fortunate (as much as anyone who contracts such a horrible disease can be considered "fortunate," anyway) to eventually receive a correct diagnosis. Which was thanks to a hunch, really, by Calahan's doctor, Souhel Najjar, who thought to give his then 24-year-old patient a test usually reserved for people with dementia or Alzheimer’s: The Clock Test. Explains Calahan:
"He first asked me to draw a circle -- and I did after one aborted attempt ...."
On the one hand, it's completely fascinating that such a simple test would solve this mystery -- on the other, it's completely horrifying to think, as Calahan says, that "there could be people in comas right now or people stuck in psych wards that have this disease and aren’t being treated properly."
Have you ever heard of this disease?

Blueberries and grapefruit are tied for Anna's favorite fruit. Grapefruit is always the first choice for breakfast, while blueberries are the preferred bedtime snack. So, when Emily asked us to go blueberry picking, we jumped at the chance to go with our berry-picking friends.
Everyone with kids knows how fruit picking goes...one in the mouth, one in the bucket. OR five in the mouth, one in the bucket. OR all in the mouth, none in the bucket. Needless to say, Anna ate her weight in blueberries.
After massive thunderstorms last night, the blueberry bushes were drenched, so we were sprinkled with water drops every time we picked a berry.
Anna's bucket rarely had more berries than in this photo. By the time we left, it was empty. This is why:
Every time I turned around, this is what I saw.
Emily and I ate about two berries each. You'd think I was eating mine, though...I walked away with just 2.5 pounds of berries, while Emily managed to pick 5 pounds!
After we finished picking, Emily's mom generously paid for my blueberries (I managed to leave the house without my wallet) while Anna and Harper begged to have their turns with the cameras. It's becoming a regular thing. Harper was adorable, setting up her shots with very specific ideas in mind. Anna captured a few cute ones, as usual:

So here’s how the conversation goes…
“It’s good to get some coffee; I’m really not a morning person.”
“Oh my god me too… so, you’re from India right?”
“Yeah, just livin’ the dream.”
“Slumdog Millionaire has to be my favourite movie of all time.”
And you think to yourself, ‘Umm, okay?!’
Let me throw another piece of conversation at you. Or to avoid losing out on readership, I’ll summarize it and try to put forth the surprise of a fellow traveller at the existence of an upper class in India. Apparently, if you can hold a conversation in English without making somebody laugh and fund a trip to Europe, you’re from the Upper East Side of New Delhi.
Instead of beginning my next sentence with a ‘Well I think lalala is to be blamed’, let’s try and understand where we’re going wrong in representing the existence of an upper-middle class. A class of people who don’t talk like Apu from The Simpsons (“Thankyoucomeagain!”) who shop at Zara, wait only preppy guys go there, okay who shop at, wait H&M isn’t here yet na, hmmm.. Okay screw it you guys, you know where we shop. This is all too far beside the point I’m trying to make.
What I want to do is examine the kind of cinema that India is sending out, without trashing it because let’s face it a Gangs of Wasseypur is hardly counter-productive for the image of Indian cinema. But let’s talk about a Slumdog Millionaire –for lack of a better example at 9 a.m. in the morning –it was one of the most successful movies of 2008, but I can’t help but feel that it got the accolades, besides the obvious reasons, because it played right into the stereotype of “Poor Little India”.
I’m well aware that the story really mattered because it was based in a slum and it was the most realistic depiction of it. But as a country looking to change its image, why aren’t we doing anything about it? The movie shows the Indian police as these mindless rowdy fools –not too unlike them jocks –who are impulsive, brash and simply messed up. It’s not like that. It’s bad, but you won’t find a policeman looking the other way while a man is being murdered. And yeah, what’s with the Hindu on Muslim violence? Didn’t really get that bit. The pure filth on the streets. The men openly preying on children. Why are we so accepting of a film that’s exaggerating the most negative points of our country?
That’s not the kind of life you and I lead. Why isn’t there anything that resembles our lifestyle? We work, we shop, we party… it’s all there in real life, just not there on-screen. And don’t tell me it’s impossible to set an interesting story in a Hauz Khas Village or an apartment on the Golf Course Road in Gurgaon. We saw a glimmer of it in Aisha, the contemporary rendition of Jane Austen’s novel
Emma, set in the high society of Delhi (I can already see some of you getting ticked off). I cannot begin to count how many reviews trashed it saying that it portrays the youth as ashamed or ignorant of their culture and tradition, and craving westernisation.
First things first, the Indian culture has changed Mr. random IMDB user sitting in Australia. We’re not craving westernisation, it’s a natural phenomenon that’s happening (Dunkin’ Donuts, Zara, etc. much?) throughout the country. Okay, well most parts of it. And yes, a large part of our everyday conversation is in English, so yeah the movie was true to Delhi culture in that regard. Did I already
talk about how we go to parties, take random trips when we’re sick of work, maybe even smoke a little *whispered* maal (Indian slang for pot), and *a fat auntie gasps* we also do the nasty nasty.
Another example I’d willingly belt out is Shaitaan. Now this movie came dangerously close to the life of an average twenty-something-year-old. I know not everyone drinks and smokes up all the time, but the portrayal is as real as it gets. Yes, we should try and hold on to our culture, the culture which teaches us the most basic of human morals: respect. You wanna target a flaw in today’s society; look at the rapid decline in respect. From rape to fuck buddies to hit and runs. A movie like Shaitaan makes it very clear that this sort of lifestyle comes with its own repercussions and in no way advocates it, but as far as representation of the upper class goes, it hits the spot.
I’ll take a contrived sidetrack and switch from movies to photography. India as a country attracts photographers from all over the world, who search and capture the most bereft of people under the garb of finding “beauty in poverty”. Seriously? No offence to your artistic licence but you’re kinda showing that we’re all living in half-disintegrated houses with dirty clothes and naked children on
the street. Take any photograph of the street. Background –you and I –completely out of focus and in the crowd there is this one woman selling bangles who is just the quintessential beauty.
No wonder it’s such a surprise when you’re sitting in a café halfway around the world with people you barely know and they look at you and assume you’re the son of like an Ambani or something.
While we’re all so eager to watch Student of the Year, I refuse to even count it in this list. While I’m still not sure if it’s set in a school or a college (that campus looks like it’s trying too hard, it’s not Gossip Girl), the language is skewed and tortured (Hey.Dude.What’s.Up.) and the actors are strangely buff to be students of any kind.
In the end I guess, it’s funny that the upper class is either non-existent or distorted into fantastical characters of Karan Johar’s Indian Serena, Dan and Nate.
So why don’t we just hide behind a bottle of Corona (YES, we can afford them here!) it’s the only logical way to save face. Cue the fat aunty gasping.

We'll let others give the thorough reviews of Sarah Palin's speech. We'd put in a couple of links, but they'd just be to the same places as always anyways, and besides the swooning we are currently undergoing makes that kinda difficult right now.
Our immediate reaction last night to the speech went like this...
As objectively as I love it so, love her so, love the speech so, and no matter how much I would no matter anything else -- the thought that Sarah Palin delivered this speech under this pressure with this amount of sickening vitriol from the left, the media and the Dems has given me a respect for her that cannot be shaken.
We feel the same this morning.
Your move, Senator Obama. Think carefully about your response. Palin went after you hard last night, inviting a hard response.
Because she wants it.
You can stand up to a little ol’ small town mayor, can’t you?
The speech certainly appealed to her base, but it will have lasting negative effects for the McCain campaign.

Giant news from the Arab world this morning as reports claim that Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi has been captured and killed by rebel forces in his hometown of Sirte. Reuters, the BBC, and other international news outlets are reporting Gaddafi's death, although it has not been confirmed by U.S. news agencies or by the American government. A gruesome cell phone photo that is reported to be the corpse of the Libyan dictator has been broadcast on MSNBC and other networks.
With Gaddafi having been in power over 40 years (since the Nixon administration to put it into context), his imminent demise poses large questions about what happens next in Libya.
As the Arab Spring continues in to fall, Libya is just the latest Arab nation making headlines as civil unrest spreads across the Middle East and Northern Africa. Since last December, we have seen political revolutions resulting in the ousting of longtime dictatorial leaders in Tunisia, Egypt , and Libya, and we have witnessed uprisings and civil protests in Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, and other Arab states.
The fire of rebellion spreading through the Arab world is exciting, and the idea that real organic democracy (not the Bush-imposed brand used in Iraq) may take hold in these nations inspires hope. With these revolutions though also comes uncertainty, and a pressing need for cautious and balanced American diplomacy and leadership (this is not time for walking tall and carrying a big stick).
As we celebrate the downfall of cruel and tyrannical dictators, we should all, regardless of political affiliation, hope our leaders are capable of thoughtfully positioning the U.S. favorably in great Arab unknown. The Arab Spring presents historical opportunities for our nation to forge new positive relationships in the Arab world. Our leaders must exercise enormous care to make sure we take an appropriate role in these events that allows us to leverage these opportunities to make new friends, or at least to avoid making new enemies.

Almost certainly first on the list for some kind of adaptation is Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series of novels. The Wheel of Time is currently the dominant force in the epic fantasy subgenre. The thirteen novels (fifteen, including the guidebook and prequel) have sold approximately 50 million copies to date in more than two dozen countries, and the series will be attracting a substantial amount of publicity next year when the fourteenth and final novel, A Memory of Light, finally hits the shelves. Given the series' immense sales clout and popularity, some kind of adaptation has been on the cards for a while. About ten years ago, Robert Jordan sold an option to NBC, who were considering making a mini-series of The Eye of the World. Nothing came of this project after those pushing it at NBC departed. A Japanese animation studio contacted Robert Jordan with a proposal to adapt the first three books as a series of movies, but they only wanted to do the first three and change the ending of the third book to the ending of the entire series. Jordan turned down this proposal.
In the mid-2000s, Red Eagle Entertainment bought the rights from Robert Jordan to develop film, computer game and comic adaptations of The Wheel of Time. In August 2008 they entered into a partnership with Universal Pictures to develop a two-hour movie based on The Eye of the World. Three years on, there appears to have been no movement on this project, and it's unclear how much longer Universal's option has left before it expires. Whilst the success of Game of Thrones may inspire Universal to take another look at the project, I think it's more likely that we will see the project re-envisaged for television.
In a series of articles I'm going to be looking at the practicalities of bringing The Wheel of Time to the screen, considering its vast scope, huge cast and immense visual effects requirements. To start with, let's ask the most basic question of all.
Should This Even Be Attempted?
There is a strong opinion amongst a subset of Wheel of Time fans that no adaptation should even be attempted. This is a series of fourteen very large books, totalling 11,000 pages in paperback when all is said and done, featuring a cast of almost 2,000 named characters sprawling across dozens of major and minor storylines. The books are what they are. Why should they be brought to the screen?
The easy answer to this is that it's going to happen. At some point, whether it's next week or twenty years from now, there's going to be an adaptation of The Wheel of Time on screen. The books have sold too many copies and there is too much potential money in a successful adaptation for it to simply be left alone. As a result, it's better (I think) to be taking this as read and considering how it may be best achieved rather than simply hoping it won't happen.
In addition, working out how on earth you'd tackle this project makes for an interesting thought-experiment.
TV or Movie?
This is the next question and one that has driven a great deal of discussion over the years. The question results in a paradox which can be summed up concisely:
The Wheel of Time is too expensive to be a TV series. It needs to be a film.Basically, the books have too many huge battles, too much magic use, too many sets, too much location work and too many non-human creatures to be viable as a TV series. Only a series of movies capable of assigning hundreds of millions of dollars to two hour-blocks at a time can give the Wheel the visual look it needs.
The Wheel of Time is too long to be a film. It needs to be a TV series.
At the same time, the books are too long with too many characters, too many storylines and too many subplots to be easily adapted as a series of films. To fit a 700-page novel (let alone the 1,000-page ones in the middle of the series) into two hours is impossible, which will result in epic cuts, with major characters and storylines having to be weeded out (great for Crossroads of Twilight, less so for The Eye of the World). Having fourteen films in the first place is also hopelessly unrealistic and impractical, splitting books across multiple films (an option apparently considered by Red Eagle) far moreso.
For me, the equation is a simple one to solve. The practical concerns about effects and budget are serious ones and should not be underestimated. However, the books don't exactly have a major battle sequence every five pages (and not one of the battles in the books so far rivals the battles that Game of Thrones will be depicting soon enough), whilst shows from Legend of the Seeker and Merlin through Heroes, BSG, Babylon 5 and Buffy the Vampire Slayer have handled extensive special effects requirements on extremely modest budgets before. In short, the practical concerns can be handled or worked-around on TV. There is no way to address or work-around the cutting of major storylines and characters in a film adaptation.
Of course, some fans and critics would be happy to see a chainsaw taken to immense length and the vast cast of characters of the books, and certainly even a TV adaptation will have to be ruthless with some aspects of the story. But to work as a film or series of films, The Wheel of Time would have to lose major elements: the Seanchan and probably the Shaido would have to go for a start, along with many of the interim obstacles Rand faces on his quest to unite the world for the Last Battle. Most dangerously, the cutting would reduce Rand's story to its bare bones: a humble guy from a bucolic countryside who, with the help of his plucky friends and a wise mentor figure (albeit an attractive woman rather than an old guy) evades black-cloaked creatures and eventually goes to a volcano to confront the bad guy. Yeah, people might think they've seen that story before.
My conclusion is that if an adaptation must proceed, it must attempt to be faithful to at least the spirit (if not the letter) of the storyline set out in the books. Taking this hugely popular story and immediately ditching 90% of it makes no sense, so the movie option has to be dismissed (as Robert Jordan himself said many years ago). So now we can consider a TV show and all the immense impracticalities and challenges of that daunting prospect.
Next time I'll ponder how you shrink 11,000 pages of dense plotting into a workable outline for a TV series without destroying the story or scaring off viewers. This will include questions about the length and structure of the overall series, the length of individual seasons (can we tell the story of The Eye of the World in five or six hours, or does it need ten?) and what impact that will have on what needs to be cut and what can be kept intact.

Aside from budgetary constraints, which you say can be resolved, do you see any other reason for not including the Seanchan storyline? I feel its too crucial, particularly going into the final books, and moreover, what with the Seanchan battle and everything, its likely to be one of the most attractive parts of the TV series, if it were made.
Loved your analysis! Do tweet when you post the next one in this series :)
I think the second half of s1 of Game of Thrones, were it starts to get really epic, will prove whether or not its possible to make an epic fantasy series on TV. So far the series has been great beyond belief, but we haven’t really had any large scale stuff yet, and WOT certainly is large scale. I’m not convinced it can be done, Rome’s 2 minute battle of Philippi didn’t exactly make a compelling argument for it.
Ignoring money issues, I think each WOT book (except for COT) needs to be at least 8-10 episodes long. Sure, there’s a lot of slow stretches(much like ASOIAF), but book 1-7 and 11-13 are also filled with such a huge amount of plot movement and action, that I think one could easily make 10 episode adaption’s that would feel fast paced.
Hmm, interesting thoughts - I agree that a TV series makes more sense - especially given the pacing of the series.
I think perhaps, one way to resolve the length issue though would be to take account of how the books are perceived.
Books 1-3 are often perceived as a trilogy, of sorts. Climaxing with Rand being confirmed as the Dragon Reborn. This could be series 1.
Elements that could be cut: Seanchan. The Eye of The world. (A lot of fans see this as a side-quest anyway, in essence a resolution imposed by the need to get a first book resolution to a series).
Cutting the Seanchan could prove problematical due to the importance they play later on. However a possibility would be to make it so that their arrival in Amadicia / Ebou Dar is their first entrance into the series.
Books 4-6 are seen as the next 'arc'. Climax being the kidnapping. Up for cutting: Shaido, Tanchico. The various journies to Salidar (Siuan et al and Nynaeve et al) could be condensed. This would be series 2.
Books 7-9 would be a good arc. Climax being The Cleansing. Up for cutting: Most of book 8, but keeping Egwene taking control. Series 3.
Books 10-11 are harder - neither has a defining climax. Candidates for a climax could be Mats marriage, or Elaynes kidnapping. Sereis 4.
Books 12-14 are much faster paced, I suspect that there is enough material for perhaps 2 or 3 series in these books. Series 5 and 6 (perhaps 7).
The Seanchan attack on the Tower here is vital - hence why the invasion of Ebou Dar has to be kept.
--------
One thing that would need to happen would be reorganising to keep the storylines roughly in parallel. This was the problem with later books - and it wouldn't adapt well to a tv series.
The problem would come with series 4 (Books 10-11). There isn't a focus on Rand in those books in any major way, so one possibility would be to move Rands Gathering Storm Arc into the 10 to 11 region. Each series before then has culminated with Rand performing a great act. and nothing in 10 or 11 would risk seeing the series cancelled right before its climax.
I still think that Eye of the World, at the very least, should be made into a movie. It's practically begging to be made into a movie, what with the way the plot is laid out. It's also the most self-contained of the Wheel of Time books, so you could make the movie, then drop the rest of the series if the movie isn't profitable.
Having fourteen films in the first place is also hopelessly unrealistic and impractical,
Several of the books would almost certainly be combined/cut. There are also a lot of subplots which really just don't go anywhere, along with lots of description.
Even so, you'd end up with a long series of movies . . . which is exactly what Hollywood loves. They love a long, successful franchise of movies that they can milk (look at the Harry Potter series of movies).
However, the books don't exactly have a major battle sequence every five pages (and not one of the battles in the books so far rivals the battles that Game of Thrones will be depicting soon enough),
I strongly disagree. A Song of Ice and Fire has only five major battles* that we see from the perspectives of the view-point characters, with the rest occurring either off-screen or in flashback. Those are spread out through-out the series.
* I'm counting
1. Tyrion's battle in AGoT
2. Battle of the Blackwater
3. Battle on the Fist of First Men
4. The Jon-led defense of the Wall vs a Wildling siege.
5. Stannis's assault on the wildlings.
Wheel of Time, on the other hand, has tons of battles with massive numbers of opponents (like tens of thousands of Trollocs or more), along with frequent and heavy use of special-effects-laden magic. For a television show, they'd either have to cut back on that extensively, or show it on lower budget effects (which can look very cheesy).
The Wheel of Time would have to lose major elements: the Seanchan and probably the Shaido would have to go for a start, along with many of the interim obstacles Rand faces on his quest to unite the world for the Last Battle.
I could live without the Shaido, who are mostly off-screen except in a handful of books. Even the Seanchan could be mostly shown off-screen in the movies.
Sorry for the long post.
There is a guide book to Wheel of Time? I am so picking it up!!
I honestly think an anime series of the Wheel of Time would be the best way to preserve it in its entirety. I don't know what kind of expenses are involved, but I imagine it'd be far less than a live action tv series. The only problem would be that WoT fans may not embrace that medium. Who knows, but I feel like anime fans are fantasy fans I think, while not all fantasy fans are anime fans.
As long as their is a lot of oversight to make sure it's not just some fan-service fest, but played more seriously, it could be great! Hey, WoT even has some pretty fan-servicey moments built into it.
And if not "anime" in style, any animation works. There's just the stigma of animated = cartoons = for children.
So yeah, that's what I'd prefer and what would work best if fidelity to the story is the main priority.
"Wheel of Time, on the other hand, has tons of battles with massive numbers of opponents (like tens of thousands of Trollocs or more), along with frequent and heavy use of special-effects-laden magic."
I know there's a perception of this, but I don't think it's really true. Dumai's Wells will be a massive set-piece, but the much larger (in terms of manpower) Battle of Cairhien in the book before mostly happens in the distance whilst Rand and Egwene observe from a wooden platform (most of Mat's battles there happen offpage/offscreen, though for TV we'd definitely need to have Mat and Couladin's fight). There's the running battles with the Seanchan in Book 8, but a lot of that is related through characters talking inbetween the engagements, not the actual combat itself, and most of the battles aren't shown in the book either.
Book 11 has a couple of medium sized-battles at Malden and the Malvide Narrows. Malden isn't actually that bad, since it happens at night and the focus is on Perrin's rescue mission, not the bigger battle which is a backdrop. The Malvide Narrows, where Mat deploys his basic proto-firearms, will need to be a bigger battle though. Rand and the channellers blowing away hordes of Trollocs with the Power will be an expensive set-piece, no doubt about that, but the Trollocs are mostly wiped out at a great distance and the whole thing can be CGIed (rather than a mix of CGI and live-action in some of these other scenes, which is more complicated). Maradon in ToM is also a big deal, but arguably it can be toned down a lot for TV.
What WoT does have much more of is the number of party-level, D&D-style skirmishes between Team Rand and bunches of Shadowspawn and so forth, but these should be more doable on a budget. As long as these things can be spread out every few episodes, it shouldn't be a problem (like when DS9 or B5 had an absolutely massive space battle and then four 'bottle shows' in a row which had next to no sfx at all to make up for it).
I know lots of people love the animation idea, but it's really not viable. Red Eagle paid a substantial figure for the rights, and Universal paid them an even more substantial figure to develop the propety, way more than the return from any anime or CGI movie that could be generated. If the rights collapse back to the Jordan Estate (as they will eventually if nothing more happens), maybe it could be done in a way that is affordable, but that's many years off.
It's also worth reiterating that a Japanese animation company was interested in the property a decade ago, but Jordan turned them down and as far as we know, there's been no interest at all from that quarter since.
Nice post. You're right that this would seem to be the next major fantasy series to be adapted for screen, whether large or small. I've been reading the Wheel of Time for many years, but my enthusiasm for it dropped off after Crossroads of Twilight. The idea of getting rid of the whole Shaido subplot makes perfect sense - then we wouldn't have to endure Perrin's interminable traipsing around after them.
Do you know which Japanese animation studio it was, that had hoped to adapt the first three books of the series? Or is that just anecdotal? I'd be interested to hear... used to be a bit of an anime buff, I did.
Fascinating post in any case, Adam. Looking forward to whatever you have up your sleeve for next time. Oh, and I'm glad your computer woes seem to be behind you. Whatever would we all do without our Wert? :I
Is the Wheel of Time worth reading? I'm thinking of trying it once all the books are finished. I've heard both pros and cons...
I would be perfectly happy if they created new characters, and follow their journey to the Last Battle. You could brush their story-lines up against major events in the book.
Creating a TV series from that angle would be much more appealing to me than butchering my favorite fantasy series.
Of course this probably isn't an option, but it should be.
@ Niall: No, the computer is more stable now than it was, but this just means it's crashing 3-4 times a day rather than 9-10. It's letting me get some stuff done, but only by constantly using Blogger's draft-saving technique or drafting files in Word and saving them every few minutes before sending them over :-(
As for the anime option, I believe RJ only ever mentioned it once:
"A japanese company contacted me about doing an animated movie. I told them no, because they wanted to do a movie based on two or three books, and I said 'no, I won't do that.'"
@Tom Bremer: It's difficult to say. I read the first seven books when I was 17 and fairly new to the fantasy genre, and read it long before ASoIaF, PoN, MBF and other big series. I think older people who've already read a lot of fantasy may find it less interesting, though it's still far better-written than say Eddings or Feist.
@Anon: That's a good idea, and when RJ was still alive I thought it would be brilliant to do a War of the Shadow movie based on his notes and outline. Of course, that's not possible now, and I think fans will be reluctant to okay any original WoT material not okayed by RJ. That leaves really only an adaptation of existing material possible.
Good post. I'm thinking it's unlikely the studio is planning beyond the first movie. If they make the first one and it's successful, they'll make a second one. If the second one is a blockbuster they'll plan for more. If it gains a cult following then maybe it moves to TV.
I'd love to see a more planned-out approach but Hollywood being Hollywood, they are probably gonna figure it out as they go.
i don't a tv show is even being considered is it? at the last WoT convention the guys from red eagle said they were making a movie, nothing about tv. they even said who was working on it.
Why do series have to be divided into seasons with a limited number of episodes? Couldn't there be a long series that has as many episodes as it takes to tell the story? Some soap operas run forever (I'm thinking of the German Lindenstraße). Of course WoT takes more preparation than a soap opera, so weekly episodes for years might not work. There might have to be breaks between books to catch up with production.
Red Eagle have a tendency to say that things are moving along, stuff is happening, announcements will be made soon and then nothing happens. Three years after the Universal deal, more than that since they optioned the property, fans' patience with them is at an all-time low.
I have no doubt that Red Eagle want to make a movie. They will make far more money even out of a failed movie than a TV series. The point I am making (and Mondragon admits in the interview) is that you cannot tell this story in the format of film. You can tell 'a story inspired by the books' but a faithful adaptation of the early books is impossible. My argument is that if you cut three-quarters of this story (and that's being ludicrously generous; it'll be more like 90%), then what's the point of adapting it in the first place? For fans there is no point whatsoever. Newcomers might get a half-decent film sharing some names with the books. But that film will not be, and cannot be, THE WHEEL OF TIME. Red Eagle have optioned the property not to produce a faithful adaptation true to the spirit of the books, but as a stepping-stone to making some dosh. Fair enough, that's what rights-management companies exist for, but to pretend that this is the best way of telling the story on screen is an outright lie.
A great post, and a great discussion.
I am one of those (who Adam mentioned in passing) who feel that much of the series would be vastly improved by cutting certain parts of it. In particular, I would love to see a heron-mark sword taken to large swaths of books 7 - 10.
Adam, your point about the similarity of the bones of Rand's story is well taken - which is one reason why I think the Seanchan need to be kept in. They are one of the more original elements of the story and set it apart in many ways.
An (incomplete) list of things I would like to see disappear from a movie adaptation (not to mention the books themselves), in no particular order:
The entire Shaido storyline, post-Couladin (including Faile's abduction and Perrin's endless quest to retrieve her).
The Bowl of the Winds / climate change subplot (the concept doesn't bother me, but it took way too long to tell and could be cut or vastly shortened).
The Prophet. (The Prophet might have been interesting if, again, it didn't take such an extraordinarily long time to wrap up his subplot.) Granted, taking away the Masema entirely essentially takes away Rand's reason for calling Perrin back from Emond's Field...
The entirety of Elayne's struggle to hold on to the throne of Andor.
The entirety of the Salidar sequence, other than the bare minimum necessary to show Egwene taking power and heading for Tar Valon.
I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting. Keep in mind also that these are just things that I think would improve the series if they were removed entirely -- there are obviously many other portions that could be cut or shortened for length's sake.
I also say this with all the love, as I still think of this series as one of my favorites. Reading the Eye of the World for the first time is one of the defining moments in my memories of reading fantasy.
The could make the series much shorter if they edited out all the romance- I did a blog post on that ( ).
Additionally they could also edit out all the time Elayne spends in the bath, that would saves hours, or if HBO were making it, add hours :-)
The entire Shaido storyline, post-Couladin (including Faile's abduction and Perrin's endless quest to retrieve her).
That pretty much eliminates most of Faile, which opens the (great) possibility of simply eliminating the character altogether. She mostly exists as something for Perrin to deal with and chase after anyways. Give him something else to do in the movies/television show.
The entirety of Elayne's struggle to hold on to the throne of Andor.
You could move the events of that earlier into the whole storyline.
In fact, you could do both. Move Elayne's struggle to get control of Andor earlier into the story, and possibly move Perrin's defense of the Two Rivers later on.
Here's the thing... while a load of the tertiary characters may be unnamed in a movie or a TV series, a lot of secondary characters will have to be kept in. However, in a TV series, these people will have just a few scenes in one season and many scenes in another (expecially important Aes Sedai like Verin and Sheriam, as well as the Foresaken). The same is the case with making a movie. You can't change the actors who play these characters for each installments, and I think keeping them all active for the huge nuber of years it would take to film this would be impossible.
I think a performance capture 3-D film, ala Tintin, made by a big name director like Spielberg or Jackson or Cameroon is what we need.
You're right that WoT is indeed an epic story. And I think the subtexts involved in Rand's descent into madness, Egwene's politicking, Mat's reluctance to take responsibility, and the Seanchan will be something that a lot of people may appreciate in the current world of terrorism and the fight against it. I know Jordan intended none of this, but those themes work really well in the context of today's world, something that is usually not easy to see unless you read the books all
together.
But I think live action movies would pose too much of a challenge. Forget the magic and the battles. Hoe will you create iconic places like Caemlyn, Tar Valon, Tear, Ebou Dar and Rhuidean? GRRM restricted himself to magestic castles. Jordan has huge cities, and all of them are very well described and most readers would want to see them on screen. The best option is to give up live-action.
I'd say a TV series is certainly the best idea. But plan it out with extreme economy to take no more than a set number of episodes, say 150, split into 7 seasons of 21-22 episodes..
They would need to be mindful of what I felt to be the cardinal sin of the first season of Legend of the Seeker. Adding in too many filler episodes. When the first season should have adapted both "Wizard's First Rule" and "Stone of Tears" to completely finish up the Darken Rahl storyline, and set up the Chimes storyline. They didn't, it turned into monster of the week, people didn't watch it, and by the time they fixed it with season 2 it was too late.
Having it on Sunday afternoons was a terrible idea too.
but the last thing died. The one with the plucky girl, and the white tower, and all the fucking dragons at the end.
Killed by Hollywood.
Award winning script too.
Do I care if Wheel of Time comes to the screen? NOT EVER.
I want to read the ending.
POSTMAN at least did some good (orange revolution).
I hope hollywood, in total, rots in hell before they start killing good series that don't work on TV or Movies.
Wheel of Time works best as a Mud. There are several. Go, play them.
Game of Thrones works horribly as a Mud. Hope nobody's doing it, because it would suck!
But it makes grand TV.
Mud?
TV would be the best medium, but the model is broken. The 10-13 episode seasons of HBO could work, but would they be committed to it? They aren't even sure Game of Thrones will be back for season 2 despite pretty big numbers. You could do a lot with a full 24-26 episode runs on primetime TV, especially on NBC who really needs a hit - look at their desperation with renewing the terrible "Heroes" and running shows like "Bionic Woman" and "The Event".
For TV, the problem becomes ratings and cost. We've seen successful Sci-fi in primetime but not Fantasy. With DVRs ruining the income-through-commercials-based-on-ratings model, it's hard to determine if costs would be covered.
Even more problematic are executives who meddle when they think they know what's best for a show. "Make Perrin the goofy sidekick to Rand! Let's get a romance going between Matt and Egwene! Where are the cute and cuddly pets?" You're dealing with marketing people who have no clue about what fans of the show want, only what they think has "worked" over the years because it fits a formula.
What you need is a screenwriter/director in Hollywood with the passion to be true to the story, and a studio willing to take a risk, like Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema did with LotR (and look where NLC is now). Obviously you can't make 14 movies, but with some tight script writing you could cut it down to 6 or 7 movies...that's Harry Potter-ish and certainly doable, but the movies would have to be no more than 2 years apart to keep actors from aging too fast and plot threads forgotten.
How do you cut out the Sanchan? Way too big a part of the plot/Mat's character arc and we still don't know what part they will play in the Last battle.
cut out parts? hell no. why dont we change everbodys name and make it a kids movie while we are at it?,
Movie producers dont have a problem
making scream 5 or final destination 5 or 6 or what ever part they are on, look up new movies coming in 2012, all remakes and parts 4s and 6s. stupid. t.v. serries= bad graphics. give me six
3 hour, rated R movies. this story deserves it. and every movie would make more money than the last...
gold mine for 6 years..... comment supzloco@yahoo.com
"cut out parts? hell no. why dont we change everbodys name and make it a kids movie while we are at it?,give me six 3 hour, rated R movies."
So you don't want parts cut, but you want the entire story condensed into 6 3-hour movies? You can't have both. 6 3-hour movies would amount to, maybe at absolute best, 7 or 8% of the story from the novels.
If you want to do WoT properly on screen, you have to do it on TV. Film is not a realistic option unless you want the story gutted.
This reminds me that Part 2 of this article is a couple of months overdue. Need to get back to that.
It's too big of a task and too much risk involved to remake the books into TV or movies. I think something similar to how True Blood has done is what should be done. A Game of Thrones of just far too predictable for me to really love, although it is worth watching. However I just love True Blood because you don't know what's going to happen.
I just hope the creation of a movie or series will inspire more readers to try the books than turn away new readers with a poorly made project.
It will be interesting to see how they put it all together, but Im not holding much hope for an adaptation that holds anything close to the experience of the Wot books. Be it TV, or film.
Its said they want to stray from the traditional "family friendly" aspect other fantasy genre movies followed. (i.e. Harry potter, Narnia, Erigon etc). but aside from Blood and gore, little about the series is Mature other than the sometimes confusing plot, but the plot confounds just about everyone at times.
point being, does this mean in-book phrases like "Burning" or "Bloody" will be replaced with actual curse words in the movie?
would it even make sense to INCREASE the maturity?
A lot of people focus on the sheer number of pages that make up the books. In the case of RJ, this is very misleading since he is a very descriptive writer. Turning this to a visual medium will remove all descriptive parts and the reintroductions of many characters in every book. This alone will decrease the material by hundreds of pages in one stroke. Dynamite turned this series into a comic and adding pictures makes a lot of difference
Personaly, I also favor the option for an animated series. An artform that is alas underestimated by many, including the major studios.
Hey from what I myself have seen of the great example Game of Thrones I think that parts of the WOT series should be put into TV format with no issue, but there are certain major parts, whole books in fact, that this format would not be compatible. For instance, spoiler alert, I think that the Battles at say the end of book Two with the Ever Victorious Army the White Cloaks and the Heroes of the Horn and the Battle for Caemlyn, whatever book that’s in, are large enough and important enough to be made into full scale films, not to mention the Last Battle. So rather than having to choose from two totally different options, I think it would be better to have a balanced mix, the practicality of this kind of setup is questionable, but if say Universal and HBO teamed up they could create something that has never been successfully achieved: A continuous story that crosses from TV to movie without a mountain of series contradictions. I do however agree that T.V. would be the primary for the series.
i,m not a big fan of reading. i never read a series of books in my life, but....... my father introduced me to the wheel of time and i,ve read them all so far and am waiting for the final book. i'm a HUGE fan of the wheel of time, and i would love to see a successful tv series come from this awsome story. and i would like to congradulate branden sanderson on doing such a great job continuing the story.
I think the idea of a tv series with some movie makes sense thats how SG-1 did it they had 2 movies and 10 seasons. They could combine some of the books into the same season with 2-3 movies and be able to it in a similar amount of time.
I feel like I need to compare this series to a few others right now in regards to whether a movie or TV series would be better.
First off, movie option is a definite no, WAY too many books and it would not feel like the series it already is. Especially if you were to compare it to Lord of the Rings, the books are about the same size, but the Wheel of Time series is easily 5x as long. 3x if you include The Hobbit in there.
Now for the TV idea, definitely more viable, but instead of making each book its own season like what HBO is doing with Game of Thrones, take say the first 3 books and turn that into a season. That takes the series from being 14 seasons long, to about 5, around the same length of Game of Thrones (that one will be 7 seasons I believe).
Now here we can combine some movie aspects into it. I agree, the special effects won't be totally stellar due to budget on a TV series, however if you figure a book on its own can make a 3 hour movie (again, comparing to Lord of the Rings here, particularly the 3rd original movie, not the extended version which is 4 hours long), then you have 9 episodes for your first season across 3 books (3 episodes per book, each episode about an hour long).
I noticed someone else commented with the same idea with the TV arc, however I disagree with cutting the Seanchan out from the first season. The reason: We have the Horn of Valere being uesd, which will play a later role. Same with why we can't cut out the Eye of the World "side quest" either, that's where it's discovered, and it ties in to Mat, as well as later when Birgette is ripped from tel'aran'rhiod. It's hard to say what can be cut out because later they come back to play a pretty major role. And with Season 2, the Shaido play a part in how the Aiel are involved with Rand, Tanchico gives you more information with the Black Ajah. The Salidar journey though I agree can probably be drastically shortened.
I definitely disagree with the people saying there's a lot of subplots that can be cut, because I've been re-reading the series quite a bit and every time I do I notice a connection between a seemingly random subplot with the greater story. Especially when bits of the Prophecy of the Dragon are mentioned. And we still have one more book to go. I have a feeling all these subplots will prove to have a significant impact on how this last book will play out.
With HBO's obvious success with Game of Thrones, and the fact that a Premium cable channel like HBO would have the budget to handle such a task, the TV series would be the best way to serve such a great series of books. The key would be Mid-Season Finales. A full 1 hour episode without commercials, would allow for a book to be covered in half a season, say 6-7 episodes, with a 1 1/2-2 hr "season" finale if needed for the major battles. this would give the network 7 full seasons of potential income, and allow a shorter amount of time for the actors/actresses to age.

What, with all these wonderful times ahead of us and I still find a way to be a grinch? We have the usual stalemate in Congress between the Republican controlled House and a Democrat controlled Senate and White House. Neither side likes the other’s deal but both sides speak desperately about avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff..”
At this point it is getting hard to figure what “meets the test balance.” It was President Obama that commissioned the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson, then rejected their plan because of the cuts it suggested to government spending. But somehow defense cuts and tax increases are a better alternative?
Here’s a secret, we are going over the cliff. The pedal has been screwed to the floor. There will be no deal because no one wants a deal. Let me explain.
If we go over the so-called fiscal cliff four things will happen.
- The Bush tax cuts will expire
- Clinton era tax rates will be adopted
- Automatic defense cuts kick in
- Some human service programs will be cut
Presumably all of these combined will work at reducing the deficit so the country can start paying down its debt. “Presumably” being a very key word.
These are all the things Democrats want (minus the fourth point). The Republicans can’t give them these things without putting up a fight. They have to if they do not wish to face an army of primary challengers during the next midterm election. So they make an offer, then a counteroffer but neither side will come to an agreement. In fact, for an agreement to work it will have to look a lot like the four points mentioned. So it is a wonderful dilemma for both parties.
One side can save face with its constituents “by fighting fiercely ” and the other side gets exactly what it wants, while blaming the program cuts on Republicans. The Democrats see this as 3 to 1. They’ll take it.
The GOP can cave without caving. The president can say he tried without ever trying.
If the GOP thinks anyone is buying this little girly slap fight show they must be high on dog food.
GOP- you`re done.
This latest bit of theater is exactly what Jason has described, a contrived way to appear tough – that won`t work any more.
Obama has written the music (actually copied from Alinsky, Piven and other noted anti Americans) and the GOP in a pathetic bid to stay relevant is dancing like a geek at the prom.
The half of this Country that realizes whats coming must roll over the GOP in what Matt Kibbe has rightly titled a “hostile Takeover”
Thomas Paine must be watching with apprehension – there are ” soul trying” times coming.
Ironically, going over the cliff is the correct economic policy. If the initial recession and market crash are allowed to happen, deficits will decline and a healthy economy will ensue.
There is a small chance that the idiots in B.C. can avoid taking us over this fiscal cliff. In my opinion, there is no chance that we will avoid the much higher cliff of the fiat money, debt addicting, sovereign debt cliff in the not to distant future. It will take down the US, Europe and most of the world. Chaos will reign for some time.
@ CoF- if Maxwell Smart can whup chaos, by God, so can we. “…if they mean to have a war….”

That's "The Bullies And The Tyrants" from March 5, 2006. Thhat was a day when I was searching for an idea.
I finally merged the Mamas and the Papas debut album cover with Bruce Springsteen's Born In the USA.
I think this works visually. I think it was okay for a day's comic. I don't think it has any staying power. It was visual at least.
When you're doing a weekly comic, there's a lot of pressure. Now days, I do several comics each week and I can really feel like the well has run dry.
And let me take a moment to thank Betty and Ann for their kind words.

Baliem valey's mummies
Wim Tok Mabel's mummy held by one of his descendant. Apparently the mummy is 362 years old. Wim Tok Mabel was a "big man" and everybody in the valley wanted his advices. Even nowadays somebody is looking for his advice! Sumpaima village, Baliem valley (Papua Barat, Indonesia).

How is it that in a country where “support our troops” ribbons and bumper stickers abound, the military is suffering from serious recruitment woes? Why has the Pentagon had to resort to questionable (at best) recruiting tactics, like creating a database of students’ personal information, possibly in violation of the Privacy Act?
A new Campus Progress article by Daniel Savickas offers a compelling answer. Savickas, who tagged along with several Army recruiters while they worked, found the “general consensus of the recruiters was that most people joining the Army today are either doing it to help pay off college debt, or to pay their way through college.” Savickas writes of recruiters who have to “sell” military service in cold calls, and quotes one saying, “A lot of the time you’ll ask for someone and they’ll tell you they’re there until they find out who you are, then they tell you the person left.” Savickas’ own conclusion gets to the heart of military recruitment problems: “I know a lot of people joining the army are trying to earn money for college or pay off college loans. I know that an education can provide a better life. But I just don’t know if it’s worth dying for.”
It doesn’t have to be this way. Answering the call to military service should mean loving our country’s principles so much that one is willing to sacrifice one’s life to protect them. If our government would stop deceiving us about matters of war, if it would adopt a foreign policy that embraces this nation’s historic values, we would have Americans enlisting because they wanted to, not because they had to.

In a startling act of fealty to polluter interests, several senators are fighting scientifically guided smog limits that would save thousands of lives a year. Under the guidance of administrator Lisa Jackson, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working to clean up one of George W. Bush’s most blatant acts of ignoring science and disregarding the law, when he personally overruled the unanimous recommendations of EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee for an ozone limit no higher than 70 ppb, setting instead an arbitrary and capricious standard of 75 ppb. Jackson intends to instead follow the law by setting a 60-70 ppb standard. However, a group of Democratic and Republican senators led by retiring Sen. Evan Bayh (D-IN) and Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) are trying to preserve Bush’s toxic legacy on behalf of the coal and oil industries in their states, complaining to Jackson that her plan “will have a significant negative impact on our states’ workers and families”:
We believe that changing the rules at this time will have a significant negative impact on our states’ workers and families and will compound the hardship that many are now facing in these difficult economic times.
The pro-smog letter was also signed by Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Richard Lugar (R-IN), Kit Bond (R-MO) and David Vitter (R-LA).
Remarkably, the senators do not seem cognizant of Bush’s well-reported act of malfeasance, complaining that “the Agency has not presented new data or evidence to justify its course of action”:
Instead, outside of the regular five-year review process, EPA is choosing to interpret the same basic body of information that existed in 2008 and reach a different conclusion. . .
Given the absence of new or different scientific data, EPA should maintain the current ozone standards, which EPA finalized only two years ago and concluded were adequately protective of public health and welfare with an adequate of safety [sic].
Actually the conclusion EPA staff and scientists drew in 2008, based on the scientific evidence that “ozone has a direct impact on rates of heart and respiratory disease and resulting premature deaths,” was that a standard no higher than 70 ppb was needed. The agency calculated that a standard of 65 ppb “would avoid 3,000 to 9,200 deaths annually,” two to three times more than a 75 ppb standard. The difference is that George W. Bush is no longer the decider.
The senators also claim that the previous smog standards harmed the economy:
We note that many states are only recently coming into attainment with the 1997, 0.084 ppm ozone standard. Attaining that standard required costly mandates on businesses, which greatly restricted the ability of local communities to grow their economies. . ..
The claim that attainment with the 1997 standard “greatly restricted the ability of local communities to grow their economies” is without evidence. In fact, the only noticeable effect of the 1997 standards on the economy was to dramatically cut the regulated pollution, making millions of children healthier, even as the economy steadily grew, as this EPA chart shows:
Finally, the senators claim — again without evidence — that “non-attainment” penalties under the Clean Air Act “undermine the economic viability of communities within our states.” In fact, “there is no clear evidence that non-attainment designations or progress in addressing air quality prevent areas from growing,” EPA officials informed the Wonk Room. Areas such as Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and many others have been non-attainment for years and have had very strong growth rates. The EPA tells the Wonk Room:
We see no significant differences in the trend of employment, wages and number of establishments between attainment and non-attainment areas.
There is clear evidence, however, that this effort to ensure that more children have asthma attacks comes on behalf of coal and oil corporations in the senators’ states. Peabody Energy, the “world’s leading coal company,” is based in Missouri and has mines in Indiana, and is a top campaign contributor to McCaskill, Bond, Lugar and Bayh. Murray Energy, the “largest privately owned coal company in America,” is based in Voinovich‘s state. Landrieu and Vitter have collected a combined $1.5 million from the pollution industry, whose refineries and power plants keep killing children and keep sending these senators back to Washington.

NEWS FLASH
Ninth Circuit Prop 8 Decision To Come Tomorrow | The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit announced today that it will hand down its decision on the constitutionality of the anti-gay Proposition 8 tomorrow. Supporters of the Constitution have good reason to be optimistic. The panel includes Judge Stephen Reinhardt, a well-known judicial liberal, and Judge Michael Daly Hawkins, who compared marriage discrimination to public school segregation during the 2010 oral argument in this case. Whichever side wins tomorrow, the decision is almost certain to be appealed to the Supreme.

Our guest blogger is Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA), a member of the House International Relations Committee.
Last Tuesday, the House took an important first step regarding the war in Iraq. It voted in favor of an important amendment to the Iraq supplemental spending bill that I introduced, along with my colleagues, Reps. Tom Allen (D-ME), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL). (Watch it here.)
The amendment we offered was very simple: it stated that no funds from this spending bill will be used to enter into military base agreements between the United States and Iraq. Stating this will clearly indicate that the U.S. has no intention of maintaining a permanent military presence in Iraq. I’m pleased to say that the House unanimously approved this amendment.
While differences exist over how and when we should leave Iraq, we should all agree that U.S. forces should not be in Iraq forever. The House is now on record as supporting that position. Unfortunately, the administration’s position is unclear.
On April 13, 2004, President Bush said, “As a proud and independent people, Iraqis do not support an indefinite occupation, and neither does America.” But last week, General John Abizaid, the Army general in charge of the U.S. troops in Iraq, told the House defense appropriations subcommittee that the U.S. could end up having permanent bases in Iraq. And today, the Los Angeles Times reports that Bush “continues to request hundreds of millions of dollars for large bases” in Iraq.

have left behind thoughts of books and homework, homeschooling moms are now sweating out thoughts of planning next years lesson plans. Glossy catalogues are arriving, two-day homeschooling conferences are in full swing. You ask your child to divide his brother’s sandwich into quarters and he gives you a glassy-eyed stare, they’re already forgetting everything you’ve taught them, and it’s only June! Maybe it was last years curriculum, maybe you need to switch it all up. Before you know it, you’re sitting pool, lake or beachside with an iced coffee, no less than three curriculum catalogues, two legal pads and a husband so desperate for your undivided attention he’s taking off his t-shirt and exposing his bright white chest to the world.
2. In what I considered to be a stroke of genius, I made the decision from the get go to school year round; three months on, one month off. The children would never suffer from the summer brain drain, I’d get December off for Christmas prep and a whole month for spring break in April. Why isn’t everyone on board with this?
3. Because when it’s hot as the Mohave, no one wants to do school. I go to pick my arm up from the lesson plans and they’re sticking. I can only motivate the kids to do their work in a timely manner by bribing them with Fudgesicles. Now there’s brown finger prints everywhere. Ignore every indication they’re not just from the Fudgesicles by eating more Fudgesicles.
4. An old house with central air is as cool and inviting as having a fat man sit on your lap and fan you with the folds of meaty flesh on his arm. Or maybe it just feels that way to me since I’m always got a child or four clinging to my sweaty body.
5. It takes a long time to fill a pool with water when your husband demands giving the well pump a break after an hour. Yes, I know it’s old and could give out at any minute but I don’t think I can keep the kids from jumping in our 3/8 filled pool and breaking their legs for much longer.
6. I’m trying to use up food from our freezer and pass it off to the kids undefrosted as a cool dinner alternative.
7. So while I’m trying to wrap up this school year and not dehydrate, I’m freaking out about next year’s school work as are many of my friends. We’re as helpful to one another a flock of cackling hens before the slaughter. “What are you using for spelling? Aaackkk, spelling, who said spelling?? I forgot about spelling? Aaackkk! I was all concerned about grammar! Aaaacckkk! Grammar, who said grammar! Aaaccckkk! I forgot about grammar! And what about transcripts?? Aaacck!” waddle, waddle, waddle
At the local homeschool conference, moms are bombarded with a dizzying array of curriculum choices. Most are lucky to emerge at day’s end without their heads exploding.
So if you’re off to a conference this weekend, keep your wits about you! Keep calm and enjoy the central air and whatever you do, don’t buy the first glossy book you see. Or you could avoid planning a bit longer by heading over to Conversion Diary for more Seven Quick Takes.

Additionally, Boston Catholic Marilyn LoPresti contacted the CDF and Apostolic Nuncio and received assurances that the Pride Mass at St. Cecelia's had been canceled. She was also assured that the Cardinal sent a communication to all pastors: they are to disassociate with the secular Gay Pride celebrations here in Boston and they are not to organize or celebrate such a Mass. These clarifications sent to priests from His Eminence were also supposed to be published in a public media statement.
But in its stead, Boston priests received this peculiar and truncated statement from Terry Donilon:
Good evening,
Recently a Mass was scheduled for St. Cecilia Church in Boston and was publicized in the parish bulletin as being held in conjunction with Gay Pride Week. This created the unintended impression that the Church was endorsing Gay Pride activities. It is not. The Mass has been postponed and will be rescheduled to a later date.
Saint Cecilia Parish is a loving and welcoming faith community and the Catholic Church treats all people with dignity and respect. The Catholic Church’s teachings on homosexuality and the dignity of the human person are rooted in faith and revelation.
Thank you,
Terry
The good news is, the statement clarifies secular festivities of Gay Pride week cannot crescendo in a Catholic Liturgy, and emphasizes the Catholic Church treats ALL PEOPLE with dignity and respect.
That ends the good news.
Now, let us pull out our BS detectors and have a go at the rest of it.
The statement seems to isolate St. Cecelia's as the only Catholic parish in the Archdiocese where gays are welcomed and treated with dignity and respect.
The last thing we need are statements coming from the Archdiocese validating acumen that Catholics-at-large want the Catholic religion to be reserved for heterosexuals.
People are hurt by this message. You're repeating the urban legend that in the Catholic Church, except for a few people, they are rejected.
Nice job fellas.
Thanks be to Jesus this crew was not in place at the time of the Civil War. The South would still be flying the Confederate flag.
Further, the spin the timing and placement of the announcement of a Mass in St. Cecelia's bulletin and Gay Pride Week is all a big misunderstanding is not gelling. Even with the Globe:
Donilon declined to answer questions about the apparent contradiction of the church’s bulletin and his statement.
Statements that nobody can swallow seems to be the public relations policy of this Archdiocese.
Why not just say there was a theological misunderstanding that is pastorally being aligned to outreach programs consistent with Catholic teaching?
He digs himself further into the hole:
He said, however, that there would be a Mass in the future to welcome the community, but not specifically gays and lesbians.
Is there going to be a broader list?
I hope we can move them beyond their fixations on who is sleeping with whom.
I wonder if we can migrate them to focus physical attributes?
How about segregating out parishes for fat people and skinny people?
It could work.
I'll tell you right now, I'm going to the parish that welcomes skinny people. Keep your coffee and donuts. I'm going where there'll be green tea and fruit cups.
I've got just the song for the welcome home Catholics program: Fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks, even kids with chicken pox.
Where are they going with this?
Does Donilon believe a Mass in the community to welcome all is something novel?
This is what every other Mass, on any other day, in any other community has been doing for the last 2000 years.
Why is it the policy of the Archbishop to publish the notion that loving and welcoming is reserved to a couple of handfuls of Catholics, and gays must flock to these places or face the hatred stewing in all other parishes?
Can't they see that they are the ones inflicting wounds?
How would you feel if suddenly the Archdiocese set up the dynamic that there are only a few parishes in town where orthodox Catholics are loved and welcomed in accordance with the Catholic religion?
Oh, wait...
:)
The moral of the story is, this is another shining example of how Cardinal O'Malley is dismantling the unity of One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church in Boston.
He is fractioning our religion to places where every priest or every part of town has its own gig. He's made clear that in the future, it will all soon be handed over to the authority of those in these philosophical and structural subdivisions.
There is a set of teachings in the Roman Catholic Church that should be taught in every parish by every priest and should all be consistent with what is taught by the roots of our faith and tradition, the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
All are most definitely welcome.
We listen, we learn, we strive, we struggle, we are tempted, we fall, we repent and we use the Sacraments to amend our lives in accordance with the Deposit of Faith.
Most if not all of us have at one time or another thought some teaching was foolish and resisted accepting and guiding our lives by the teaching. Some of us even have periods in our lives when the teaching was too much of a burden on our own desires and we checked out.
Sometimes, even a priest will derail and come up with an idea that is not theologically sound. There is supposed to be a local shepherd, the Bishop, who rescues his straying priests and brings us all to unity under sound Catholic teaching and theology.
In the absence of this in Boston, things and people with an ax to grind against religion or Catholics are going to pick up the story and use it for ammunition to divide and conquer.

Carol,
Having read the post several observations come to mind.
1.) Kindly learn to proofread your posts prior to posting them. This simple step will enable one to more readily and easily read the screeds you publish.
2.) I would recommend a psych eval for you posthaste.
3.) Since when did detraction and calumny become hallmarks of a faithful Catholic instead of, as I was taught, mortal sins?
Have a great day!
Carol, splendid comments in the Globe article.
The Globe, of course tags believing Roman Catholics as "conservative", while the dissenters and their enablers are presented without description. The same Old Media trickery.
Father Unitarian (eh, I mean Unni) will continue his efforts to balkanize Catholics into his ideological and sexual categories. Unfortunately, the mealy mouthed response of the Archdiocese is not encouraging.The vigilance of local believing Roman Catholics shamed them into taking action. Good work!
Carol, It is interesting that those who despise your faithfulness to Catholic teaching are calling for you to undergo "pysch eval".
Using psychiatry and psychology as political weapons was favored by Soviet communism in the waning days of Brezhnev, Chernenko and Andropov. Similarly, it's a favored tactic of the current crop of those who would use the Church as a tool to promote their sexual and secularizing ideologies. A totalitarian personality will always resort to these underhanded tactics.
Instead of preaching the truth of
things to an unbelieving world
our "Cardinal Sean" seeks to conform to that world.
The Church teaches the dignity of
man and of his sexuality. These sad
people (GAY -GOOD AS YOU)propogate
what is unnatural and destructive to person and anithetical to "community"
To the first commenter, who like most cowards, made your disparaging remarks anonymously:
What's your point, if indeed you have one?
My anomymous comment on "Cardinal
Sean" has to be so as I am an
orthodox priest serving in an
unorthodox archdiocese.
Thanks be to Jesus this crew was not in place at the time of the Civil War. The South would still be flying the Confederate flag.
Wonderful analogy, Carol!
Besides, "this crew" probably would justify slavery as part of the price for not going to war...which, come to think of it, is what you're saying. :)
BTW, have you ever considered making a formal complaint to the Papal Nuncio about O'Malley's apparent recklessness?
My anomymous comment on "Cardinal Sean" has to be so as I am an orthodox priest serving in an unorthodox archdiocese.
Which, I assume, means that you would suffer retribution, otherwise?
Mahony did the same thing in Los Angeles.
Boy, these "princes of the Church" sure think alike, don't they? Who cares about being "progressive" or "traditionalist" when you can intimidate people who disagree w/you.
Maybe "Cardinal Sean" should exchange his brown cassock for a black pinstriped suit and a fedora. Then he should Italianize his last name. Thus would he be a more accurate depiction of what he truly represents and is.
Of course, some knee-high black boots and a Gestapo uniform would do the trick, as well. So would an olive-green uniform w/a red star on the front of the peaked cap...
"My anomymous comment on "Cardinal
Sean" has to be so as I am an
orthodox priest serving in an
unorthodox archdiocese."
I was making reference to the very first comment on this page, which was also made anonymously, not to the specific comments about Cardinal Sean. You didn't make disparaging remarks, the first commenter did. Apologies for any offense to the good Father, as none was intended.
No offense taken.
In our parish we have special
devotion to the "Little Flower."
May the Lord Bless you.
No offense taken.
The "Little Flower" has always
been a favorite of mine.
I wish the Cardinal would make
our Archdiocese a missionary
Church instead of a secular PR machine.
May God continue to bless you.
My anomymous #
You aren't another limp wristed cleric seeking to defame the church, are you? I am SURE it just could not be a JESUIT, right? Who are the bullies?
Bravo, Carol!!!
Thank you Father, I will pray for you, as I do for all priests. You have your work cut out for you. If the cardinal won't make yours a missionary parish, any chance of becoming a personal parish? I'm not exactly sure how that works, but perhaps it's another option.
O'malley should have never enabled
and empowered this group at St Cecilia's parish.
It is run by a homosexual activist, one Richard Ianolli masquerading as a Roman Catholic parishoner there.
This personage is intellectually and spiritually dishonest.
His position is ludicrous - akin to belonging to a labor union but being unalterably oppossed to collective bargaining!.
As the fist comment suggests, this post is so illiterate as to be almost unreadable.
However I felt the need to respond to this garbage:
"The last thing we need are statements coming from the Archdiocese validating acumen [sic] that Catholics-at-large want the Catholic religion to be reserved for heterosexuals.
People are hurt by this message...Can't they see that they are the ones inflicting wounds? "
People are hurt by this message? How myopic and hypocritical do you have to be to say "people are hurt" by THIS message when the Roman Catholic Church has spent centuries vilifying and persecuting gay, lesbian and transgender people, a campaign which continues to this day?
And as for wounds inflicted, look to the extraordinarily high rate of suicide among young queer people, and the studies which demonstrate highly religious families are more dangerous for such youth.
The wounds caused here are by the irrational mistreatment of queer people by this powerful and unaccountable institution: an institution so venal that it has attempted a systematic cover-up of the worldwide abuse and torture of defenseless children.
Anyone who still associates themselves with the Catholic hierarchy after such extraordinary criminality is morally bankrupt, so no wonder why you take this wicked and sickening stance when it comes to welcoming and affirming human beings who are different.
Shame on you.
James, when Jesus encountered the prostitutes and the tax collectors, He not only embraced them, but He also admonished them to "go, and sin no more". If "queer" people, (your terminology, not mine) want to seek forgiveness and healing, that is one thing, but to insist that a disordered lifestyle be made acceptable is quite another. Those who suffer same-sex attraction carry a cross unlike any other. But if "welcoming" these suffering brothers and sisters means embracing their lifestyle and insistence on accepting it, this would more accurately fit the description of morally bankrupt. Our Lady of Fatima said that more people go to Hell because of sins of the flesh than for any other reason. I don't want to go to Hell, and I certainly don't want anyone else to go there. If the desire to save souls is seen as hateful and wicked, well, Jesus never said it would be easy. There is no charity in condoning sex between people of the same gender.
I agree with Jack O'Malley - the only way that Mass could have been permitted to take place is if that message was going to be delivered.
If you don't cherish the disgusting things they do with one another, you're "hateful", "illiterate", "bigoted" and in need of some psychological help.
Homosexuality is a mental illness and that manifests itself every time they go on parade demanding that you accept their buggery.
James,
Catholics have not done a very good job of getting the message across to the gay community that all are welcome at every Mass and every parish every day of the week.
The teachings of the Church are tough for every one of us in our own little worlds but as a community, we want to hear them and we want our families to hear them. As difficult as they are, the Catholic religion is a promise, a fiat, to live our lives by these teachings.
Things start to go awry when there's an effort to silence the teachings and this is certainly not limited to moral teaching on sexuality. Women object to the teachings on contraception, abortion, etc.
Divorced people who are not annulled have to live a celibate life. This is no different than what the Church asks of people with same-sex attraction.
It isn't mean or spiteful for the people in the pews beside us to want their religion preserved in it's entirety, even if it is a terrible burden to us.
Fr. Unni is doing a disservice to his Christ, His Church and the people sitting in his pews, the Sacred Liturgy and to the unity of all Catholics.
James Croft: the Roman Catholic Church has spent centuries vilifying and persecuting gay, lesbian and transgender people,
James, this is a blatant lie. The Church has only ever condemned homosexual acts.
Further, you must realise that your statement about "transgendered" people is risible on the face of it.
First, "transgender" surgery is a modern phenomenon of the medical art and is not centuries old.
Second, "transgendered" people are not so in fact as a simple DNA test will attest.
Third, the Church condemns mutilation of the body, the temple of the Holy Ghost, even such mutilation as tattoos. How much more ought "transgender" surgery to be condemned.
For "gay" and lesbian (alas that the sublime lyricism of Sappho should have ever after tarnished the name of that beautiful island!) people are called by the Church to the same moral strictures as are unmarried heterosexuals. That is to say, to chastity. "Transgendered" people must have contrition when confessing the sin of mutilation of their bodies, since repair of that mutilation is not possible.
Can a Catholic active homosexual devoutly pray the Rosary or say the Angelus with the knowledge that his or her acts make a mockery of Our Lady's chaste and sinless life? Do you now begin to understand that your invective is blasphemy towards God, the Creator and King of the Universe, the Stablisher of the Moral Law? That it reviles His Only-begotten Son whose chaste Life, whose Passion, Death and Resurrection, whose founding of His Church upon Peter were for the sake of your redemption? Or are you so sunken in the slough of sin that you longer care to be redeemed?
James Croft, I have a question for you. If anyone wants to offer true compassion to an alcoholic friend, does he buy that friend a beer? Of course not, for he'd be only greasing the skids as his friend accelerates his dreadful decline to destruction. Rather, he would do anything to help him overcome his vile habit.
True compassion towards those with same-sex attractions would be to help them overcome those disordered attractions, not to inculcate them. Our Lord welcomed sinners where they were - but He never allowed them to remain where they were. He always - always - challenged them to repentance.
James, I followed your profile and noticed that you're an atheist. Therefore, you cannot possibly appeal to an objective standard of right versus wrong, as such transcends human consensus. I wonder then, how you can, with a straight face, tell Catholics that they "should be ashamed". That doesn't fly, my friend, and I'm not letting you get away with that!
I don't know who said this, but I think it bears repeating: "Those who live like there's no God, better be right." They aren't of course. I pray that you and all atheists/humanists come to realization of the truth.
Jack, your confusion of transgender people with people who have had sex change operations demonstrates you profound ignorance of this subject - at last seek to inform yourself before telling people how to live their lives.
As for this - "The Church has only ever condemned homosexual acts" - tell that to the people who have been murdered, mutilated, subjected to fake 'medical' procedures, ostracized, and prevented from seeking political office by people inspired by their religious commitments as shaped by the Catholic Church. In what alternate universe do you live?
I have absolutely no fear of your non-existent God. I only fear hateful bigots like you who seek to enforce your morality on others through social stigma and the courts.
LOL. That's the price you have to pay for 'we welcome all'!
James, again, being an atheist, you have no standard of right vs wrong, love vs hate, that transcends the whims and fancies of human beings. Therefore, you have no intellectual basis to accuse anyone of being "hateful bigots".
Anyone who has murdered or maimed anybody has NOT been "shaped by the Catholic Church", your slanderous statements not withstanding. Those acts are condemned by the Church roundly.
As far as "seeking political office", they can - and do -seek such office. Now whether or not people vote for them is another matter, but please understand that the voters can vote for whomever they wish and for whatever reason they deem best (psst! They have rights, too!).
Speaking of other people having rights, I do believe the original topic regarded a Catholic Mass. Well the Catholic hierarchy has a right to determine what will be acceptable practices within their churches, like it or lump it. It is those who seek to disenfranchise Catholics of the right to the free practice of their faith who are the true "hateful bigots".
"It is those who seek to disenfranchise Catholics of the right to the free practice of their faith who are the true "hateful bigots"."
Do you include the archdiocese of Boston in this description then? Since it was they who prevented the Catholics at St Cecelia's from practicing their faith as they understood ot. I am the one defending their right to practice in this instance!
"being an atheist, you have no standard of right vs wrong, love vs hate, that transcends the whims and fancies of human beings. Therefore, you have no intellectual basis to accuse anyone of being "hateful bigots"."
Reality provides plenty of evidence regarding what promotes human flourishing and what does not, and this provides the only basis for morality we need or can hope to have.
Since there is no good evidence that the entity you credit with providing a foundation for morality actually exists, you are the one without intellectual basis here - your worldview is based on a fantasy!
James, Fr. Unni's ministry at St. Cecelia's is perverting the Catholic religion. The Archdiocese was forced to act when the fraud was exposed.
So, you have it wrong. The Catholics who asked that Christs Holy Sacrifice of the Mass be protected from theological perversion are the people who are protecting the free right to practice our religion.
You cannot convince people who have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and have felt His presence as surely as they have felt the sun on their faces that Christ is a fantasy. It is as laughable as telling a microbiologist that there is no such thing as germs because you can't see them.
The teachings of the Catholic Church and the people who want to hear them is what will prevail until the end of time. That victory was won for us by Christ's Death and Resurrection.
You're talking to the descendants of 2000 years worth of martyrs.
Viva Christo Rey.
James Croft predictably pontificated: tell that to the people who have been murdered, mutilated, subjected to fake 'medical' procedures, ostracized, and prevented from seeking political office by people inspired by their religious commitments as shaped by the Catholic Church.
You're right. How could I have been so blind. The Church did all of those things? Or "inspired" them? The clerical state has always been a haven for homos. You are a bigot of the first order and not worth responding to.
In what alternate universe do you live?
In the only one created by God and subject to His immutable Law.
I have absolutely no fear of your non-existent God.?
You are a lost soul in this world and the next. You already know you are lost in this world now, don't you? How many failed relationships have you had? How many sordid encounters with unknowns? When will you tire of your squalid mode of living and yearn for something more permanent. The Gospel will be there for you. And you will read it as you grow older and lonelier. The Lord will not abandon you though you have temporarily abandoned Him.
I only fear hateful bigots like you who seek to enforce your morality on others through social stigma and the courts.
I impose no morality on anyone. You can do with your backside what you will. The arse evolved to be a one-way street, pal. It takes no morality to figure that out, just the natural law.
I thought you purported to be Catholic. You aren't. So go to buggery for all I care.
And the courts? LOL! Do you live in the Commonwealth of Sodomchusetts? The perversion of invert "marriage" was imposed by the courts! Social stigma? What about the miscreants and their lurid ostentations during that abominable parade? There was a time the whole lot of them would have been arrested. That time will come again as the world regains its sanity.
Come back with more venom if you must. Clamato in podicem catamiti tui. Ego tibi non auscultabo.
Anyone who has murdered or maimed anybody has NOT been "shaped by the Catholic Church", your slanderous statements not withstanding. Those acts are condemned by the Church roundly.
DC, have you ever heard of Joan of Arc or the Albigensian Crusade? Have you ever heard of the phrase, "Kill them all; God will know his own"? How about the murderous intrigue that permeated the Vatican for centuries?
I'm not saying that those atrocities justify James Croft's attitudes toward homosexuality or Catholicism. But people must be honest about history.
I pity you, Jack O'Malley. So much hatred, and a disturbing obsession with others' sex lives. I so hope one day the light of reason will burn the scales from your eyes and you will know what it is to see clearly.
Adversus solem ne loquitor. Veritas vos liberabit.
James,
Fr. Unni and people like him have been passing out the kookaid that Christ and His Church hate but he 'loves'. His mind is tangled up in his violations of the First Commandment.
He is feeding your anger and rebellion from God so that you will idolize him.
He and people like him prevent listeners from the understanding that people who try to guide us from doing harm to our soul and separating us from God are acts of love, not hate. But like a loving mother who will tell you not to ride your bike without a helmet - the advice isn't borne out of hate, but love.
If Unni had his head screwed on straight, he would and could heal you of your anger. You are paying the heavy price for his obstacle to seeing God's love. In fact, we all are paying that price.
Joseph - when we are talking about just war where people suffering evil and oppression under a dictator, of course God is on one side of that conflict. Yes, God inspires and will supply the people freeing the oppressed.
James is taking this out of context and liken it to what He feels, i.e., Divine Law is 'killing his spirit'.
It's a bogus comparison.
I'm on my way to work so I want everyone to be on their best behavior in the com boxes.
The RCC hierarchy has been criminally tolerant of the homosexual abusers within the clergy.
The recent John Jay study shows that 81% of the clerical abuse cases were same sex abuse against post pubescent males.
This tolerance of homosexual acts by the RCC hierarchy cries out to heaven.
Poor James at war with reality
and our given nature.
Biology is not bigotry!
Things are as they are and no amount of self deception makes
them otherwise.
We must love creation and not
be at war against it.
It's people like you that make me very happy I left the Catholic faith a long time ago. I'll never be back.
You haven't got a chance with fraud
And might as well be true to God!
Joe,
If you've left it then it's time to give up the obsession with the RCC.
Mr. Croft's and your Catholic bashing must fill a pyschic emptiness that (for secularists like yourselves) can only be addressed by a sensitive professional in a therapeutic setting. Good luck in finding one.
It's an astonishing state of mind which considers principled criticism of a hugely powerful and largely unaccountable institution to be a sign of psychological problems. A demonstration of extraordinary arrogance, in fact.
Do you think that gay people should just remain silent while they are denigrated and cast out, while it is made clear they are not welcome, while they are termed "disordered" and "pathological"? I, for one, refuse to allow this immoral institution to insult me and people like me without speaking up. You would do the same were you shown such a lack of compassion.
Tennessee Williams compared the homosexual compulsion to "needing
a fix" and to "the stabbibng of a hypo needle".
All civilizations and peoples have
had strictures against homosexuality as destructive to the person and to civilization.
It is not the institution of the RCC. Natural law is a reality. Try holding your breathe!!
If your criticism was directed at the homosexual clerical abuse and the hierarchy's enabling of such acts, then you would be on very principled ground indeed.
However, your rage against the Magisterium's perennial teaching (based on biblical and natural law grounds) against homosexual acts is grounded in sexual and political ideology at best-as a personal obsession it very well may require a therapeutic response.
Let's repeat the teaching of the Church for the benefit of those blinded by their own unbridled lechery (one of the deadly sins):
Homosexual orientation is objectively disordered. Clearly true as its object is not the opposite sex and cannot lead to the generation of new life.
Homosexual acts are intrinsically evil. True again as they are a perversion of God's purpose in creation. Incidentally, acts of sodomy between a man and a woman are also condemned by the Church. A married couple is also called to chastity.
The term "psychopathology" has not been used by the Church. I used the term in its Greek sense, i.e. sickness of the soul. This is also true since that sickness leads to a rejection of God and the Law of God. Dura lex, sed lex. That Law was promulgated both in the Old Testament and in the New.
The cure is a life of prayer and chastity.
Those who so hate the teachings of the Church, which are the teachings of Christ, that they flout their vice in Catholic venues are clearly deeply troubled and soul-sick. They are seeking approbation of their errors. To interpret correctly another commenter's Latin adage: they are speaking against the sun (the natural law) and against the Son (the Divine Law). The Truth (Christ) will indeed set you free; Error (Satan) will enslave you.
He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Place your trust in Him. Sometimes it takes a lifetime to learn this.
Joseph D'Hippolito,
Your mentioning of the lamentable massacre of Béziers and the revolting command of Arnaud Amaury recalled the old Dominican joke:
-- What are the similarities between the Jesuits and the Dominicans?
-- They were both founded by Spaniards, the Dominicans by St. Dominic and the Jesuits by St. Ignatius of Loyola. They both fought heretics, the Domincans the Albigenses and the Jesuits the Protestants.
-- And what are the differences?
-- Seen any Albigensians lately?
Sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen.
Wyndham Lewis in the 1920's forsaw the destruction of the family with attacks on male's ability to reason. He foresaw the feminization of the male predicting the plague of
of pathics and the neuter gender
now upon us-
"At twenty-five, thirty-five and forty-five one still sees them pouting lisping and sobbing spread eagled on their backs helpless and
inviting caresses like a bald stomached dog." THE ART OF BEING RULED
James Croft, I'm not a homosexual yet I feel embarassed by the insults you had to endure on this thread. Those responses do not reflect what Christian love should be (see I Corinthians 13: 1-13).
James, if Jesus met you, He would not treat you the way that many on this thread have. Nor would he approve of homosexuality. But in the final analysis, those are separate issues.
People can love others while disagreeing with their opinions by not engaging in personal insults that have nothing to do w/the issue at hand.
Many "gay" apologists engage in the same behavior. They say that questioning the social wisdom of supporting same-sex marriage is the exact same thing as supporting the brutalization and murder of Matthew Sheperd. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The former is a legitimate challenge to the "gay" perspective on how best to govern society; the latter is nothing more than evil. Many people (like myself) who question the idea of same-sex marriage want nothing to do w/Sheperd's tormentors. What they did was evil regardless of who their victim was.
I've read WLewis. He was remarkably
insightful and on the verge of entering the Church as evident in his last works.
His friend, the greatest lyrical poet of the 2oth century Roy Campbell became a convert to the Church.
In the Georgiad campbell had some wonderful lines about the decline
of civilization and art that Lewis spoke to deeming them -
Intellectual without intellect
And sexless folk whose sexes intersect.
Mr. D'Hippolito,
You may very well have a job as a dissembling spokesman for the Archdiocese of Boston.
Your broad brushed allegation of personal attacks is shameful. There are very strong indictments of homosexuality. There are very pointed critiques of the homosexual movement and their anti-Catholic agenda.
However, unlike Mr. Croft's personal characterizations of faithful Catholics as "illiterates", "garbage", "morally bankrupt" and "criminals", your indictment does not hold up to scrutiny.
There is no charity in attempting to portray sinful acts as virtue.
Joseph D'Hippolito,
I will pass over your attempt to seize the high ground for display of your own hubris. You clearly know far better than we slugs slithering in the slime what Jesus would or would not do. But The Little Way reminds us what Jesus actually did do: He told them to go and sin no more. It has been pointed out on this thread ad nauseam that homosexual acts are indeed sin, whereas homosexual orientation unacted upon is not. But Mr. Croft as a free-thinking free-feeling free-acting free-mouthing atheistic ignoramus has brought his bigotry, his irrational and uninformed hatred for the Catholic Church to this blog and has personally insulted his hostess on top of it. Will you at least join me in reproving his bumptious discourtesy towards a woman and dereliction as a gentleman? But I for one will counter his vitriol against the Church even if you will not.
I will merely quote for you a relevant verse from the chapter you chose to puff yourself up as the quintessence of non-judgemental always-be-nice Christian charity. Viz., [Caritas] non gaudet super iniquitatem, congaudet autem veritati ([Charity] does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices with the truth).
As you are a thumper for St. Paul, will you now quote his condemnation of homosexual acts for our Christian edification? The relevant Epistles would be Romans, Galatians as well as that selfsame First Corinthians you have just used to hector us. I leave you to find chapter and verse.
Michael, where have I ever tried to "portray sinful acts as virtue"? For that matter where have I ever said that homosexuality was acceptable? You accuse me of making "broad-brush allegations personal attacks," yet you do the same thing!
Jack O'Malley, knowing what Jesus "would or would not do" is not "hubris." All you have to do is read the NT. Just as The Little Way said, Jesus didn't condemn the adulteress but told her not to sin anymore. If His behavior is consistent, then He would have behaved the same way w/James. He ate and drank with "tax collectors and sinners" because He wanted to make God's love accessable to them. It's that love that will make them change. The "cure" is not an act of the will. The cure is God's Spirit changing the homosexual from within. If you find that to be "non-judgmental always-be-nice Christian charity," then you would have a problem with SS Matthew and Paul, among others, who experienced this "cure" from within for their own sins (and, no, homosexuality was not one of those sins).
Christians are called to imitate Christ, right Jack? If we are called to imitate Him, that means we have to know what He would or would not do, right?
On a more practical level, just because James Croft behaves like a jerk doesn't mean that those who claim to be Christians have the prerogative to behave in kind. The Church doesn't need you to defend it, Michael and Jack. It has survived 2,000-plus years w/o either of you. It will survive another 2,000 years...unless God decides to punish it for forsaking its Petrine commission for secular power, prestige and influence. The pity is that the vast majority of Catholics don't see it coming.
Don't believe me? Look up the vision of Leo XIII.
As Belloc said Christ was not a
"milk sop". He also whipped paople
out of the temple.
The greatest charity is to speak truth to an unbelieving world.
All of the comments on this site
were temperate and reasoned with
the exception of the person who
calls people illiterate and was
aptly educated about many things
including Whydham Lewis.
Joseph,
Well, at least you admit Mr. Croft is a jerk. One step at a time.
But the Church does need Michael and me, and you too Joe. It needs Mr. Croft as well. His presence here betokens an eventual conversion. Trust me.
I'll tell you what. As a concession to your liberal Catholicism, I'm going to take an IRS agent to lunch next week. He lives down the street so I don't have to go into the highways and byways to look for a publican. Besides, in Ireland, a "publican" is a man of highest merit. I'd take a prostitute to lunch too, but Mrs. O'Malley wouldn't let me put it on my "New Evangelization" expense account.
But enough of these ephemeral ecclesiastical disputes. The Bruins are up 4-0 in the first intermission. I still have the faith.
BTW, Joe, where are those Pauline cites you were going to furnish?
Mr. D'Hippolito:
The giving of aid and comfort to a rabid anti-Catholic, under the guise of charity and compassion, I characterize as a vice disguising itself as a virtue.
That you reject homosexuality, as one of the four sins that cries out to heaven, is welcome news. However, it does not mitigate attempts to protect an ideological anti-Catholic's "feelings".
Our Lord did not help relocate the moneychangers from the Temple by means of a social program or small business loans. He turned over their tables and opened up a can of "kick-ass" on them. The plague of sexual depravity cannot be coddled.
Yes, the teaching of the Church is compassionate, however the characterization of the sin cannot be watered down.
Sorry, there are five sins which cry out to heaven, #]
The refernce to Jesus and his opening of the can of "kick-ass" may actually have been a can of "whoop-ass". Biblical scholars are divided on the issue. The effects are the same.
So Carol,
Father Unni says he is hurt by the bloggers who spoke out against him and his parish. If the archdiocese in its spokesman is not going to teach the Truth, do you think the Boston Bloggers could write an op-ed piece together detailing the very good reasons for the Catholic teaching on homosexuality? I'm serious. Some one has to tell the Truth, and it looks like God has put you into a position to do it.
M
M, Me thinks that is his Bishop's job. There are more developments on this story coming in the next few days so stay tuned.
Meanwhile, there are more gripping photos of Weiner and a debate to talk about. I was tied up and couldn't watch. Was it a disaster?
What do you mean, there are more developments coming? Such as?
"Priest says all are welcome in his church Supports gays, lesbians after Mass was canceled June 13, 2011
By Laura J. Nelson, Globe Correspondent
"About 200 members of the congregation wore buttons that displayed a cross…Sunday Mass at St. Cecilia’s Church in the Back Bay brought the first standing ovation any parishioner could remember.
During the first Mass since the Archdiocese of Boston canceled one planned for next weekend in support of St. Cecilia’s gay and lesbian churchgoers, the.’ ’’
BOSTON.COM
America Magazine is, what else, pleased as punch.Looks like this story is far from over., as heterosexuals, the first concern one might want to have, rather than looking outwards, to the homosexual, is to look inwards, to see how well or how poorly, I am responding to the teachings of the church regarding my attitude and treatment of homosexuals? Am I known, for my respect, compassion, and sensitivity towards homosexuals? Do I avoid EVERY sign of unjust discrimination in their regard? Am I known for this? People won't approach me if I'm known for judgmental finger pointing but thankfully, I am not allowed to do that, as a catholic, am I?
Do I befriend and encourage, through my own lived out example of self mastery and Christian witness, to a homosexual person that helps them to know and believe and begin to trust, in a God who loves them so much?
Do I believe God loves them, truly? Do I love them, truly? Have I allowed the Holy Spirit to shine His light on my heart in this area? To know me, to root out any prejudice I may have harboured along the way?
Personally, I find often, that by the time I tidy up my side of the street, it's much easier to see what's really tripping me up. I can be long sighted sometimes, when all the while the garbage that needs picking up and dealing with is right under my own nose, on my side of the pavement!
still, I'm a work in progrees, like most of us, I guess.
But when people are using the Church to justify their sin
then we must speak out.
This is the essence of charity.
As to applause in Church, something is wrong - the crowd always prefers a Barrabus to Christ!
Patrick said:
"But when people are using the Church to justify their sin

Oh yes, I agree. When people are doing that, we must definitely speak out, or comment.
The radical homosexual movement has identified the RCC as Enemy#1.
They use calumny, distortion and unbridled hatred to achieve their goal to, at a minimum, quarantine Roman Catholics from the public square.
Of course, the perennial teaching of the RCC has been compassion in dealing with the individual homosexual person, as outlined beautifully in then Cardinal Ratzinger's CDF statement:"On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons".
However, when faced with a political and ideological campaign by extremists, faithful Catholiics must not be disarmed in responding to campaigns to neuter the Church's Magisterium. We must respond forcefully, swiftly and with all the tools in our arsenals.
I was amazed by the restraint that commentators on this blog used in responding effectively to the anti-Catholic extremists.
Breathnach said :"I was amazed by the restraint that commentators on this blog used in responding effectively to the anti-Catholic extremists."
Really? I didn't find the responses that restrained myself, for example....
'Homosexuality is a mental illness and that manifests itself every time they go on parade demanding that you accept their buggery.'
'Tennessee Williams compared the homosexual compulsion to "needing
a fix" and to "the stabbibng of a hypo needle".
? '
'Of course, some knee-high black boots and a Gestapo uniform would do the trick, as well. So would an olive-green uniform w/a red star on the front of the peaked cap...'
'Do you now begin to understand that your invective is blasphemy towards God, the Creator and King of the Universe....... Or are you so sunken in the slough of sin that you longer care to be redeemed?'
'The Church teaches the dignity of
man and of his sexuality. These sad
people (GAY -GOOD AS YOU)propogate
what is unnatural and destructive to person and anithetical to "community"'
'Poor James at war with reality
and our given nature.
Biology is not bigotry!
Things are as they are and no amount of self deception makes
them otherwise.'
'Mr. Croft's and your Catholic bashing must fill a pyschic emptiness that (for secularists like yourselves) can only be addressed by a sensitive professional in a therapeutic setting. Good luck in finding one.'
'It is not the institution of the RCC. Natural law is a reality. Try holding your breathe!!'.
shadow,
Your litany of perceived slights against homosexuals is without merit.
The following are taken from the aforementioned CDF statement on the care of homosexual persons. They are more hard hitting than some of the polemics you have quoted from commentators:
."
Now I will address my contribution that you single out as, I suppose,uncharitable:
'Mr. Croft's and your Catholic bashing must fill a pyschic emptiness that (for secularists like yourselves) can only be addressed by a sensitive professional in a therapeutic setting. Good luck in finding one.'
I completely stand by this statement. It in no way slurs Croft or the other person for their homosexuality, instead it attacks their ideological and hateful methods of attack against Catholics as..."haters" "criminals" and "illiterates".
I do believe unbridled rage is a spiritual and pyschic disease, therefore I suggested a secular remedy for their rage.
Shadowlands,
Your quote from the CCC is incomplete and I question your dubious editorial license.
The other relevant quotes from the CCC.
Michael,
you question my alleged dubious editing do you? Perhaps you find it hard to trust people generally?
Let me say, I did not pick and choose to 'win' an argument. You don't have to justify the way you talk to and about homosexuals, to me. Only to God.
I have not said what I have said, to get into a battle with you all. I have said it, because I believe it. Whatever the outcome of what I say, is not in my power, nor indeed any of my business.
But I could not stay silent, in this instance, without being dishonest to my own professed beliefs.
I have said what it is in my heart.
Shadowlands,
Pointing out passages (that are directly relevant) from the CCC was not intended to enter a "battle" with you. I don't consider civil discussions military confrontations.
My "trust quotient" does not come into play when engaging in rational arguments on the internet. I scrutinized your posting and did find your selective quotation to be woefully inadequate.
There's no need to search within the dark recesses of my soul in hopes of finding a paranoid.
Shadowlands (Terrae umbrosae),.
For your penance, say three Our Fathers and three Hail Marys and make a good Act of Contrition. Go and sin no more.
Sentire cum Ecclesia, Shadowlands. Sentire cum Ecclesia.
Now you have the Latin for your Lewis-inspired moniker. A gift from me to you. God bless you.
Gentlemen,
You've been busy, busy!
I don't completely subscribe to Joe and shadowland's assertions, but come on, let us admit that a few of those quotes are a wee bit over the top.
I understand this man's pain comes from feeling rejection, but an atheist from out of town using bullying to imply the teachings of the Catholic Church have no place in the Catholic Church is going to get a push back.
It's tough to find the right balance between using the opportunity to bandage his wounds while still making it clear the teachings of the Church will be proclaimed.
As Fr. Unni and his congregation demonstrate, people who want the teachings of the Church taught are the furthest thing from welcome - so 'we welcome all' is a lot of hooey. This is not something that we can continue.
Would they ban and burn Tennesee Williams and all his works?
And the great truth teller W.Lewis
ad all his art and books would they be put to the flame too because he affirmed our basic human nature?
These people are really haters of reality and totalitarians!
To Fr Unni
Thou art in error, trouble me not with your righteousness. The Church has innocense to defend and ignorance to instruct.
If Fr Unni cannot accept the beautiful teachings of the RCC
on human sexuality then why has he not the courage to leave the Church
instead of being a hypocrite?
Resign!
Shadowlands,
Please check out the Boston Globe comments section whenever a story involving the RCC is posted.
You will see an orgy of hatred, abuse and vileness against RCC clergy and laity that is disgusting to behold. The majority of this vileness is committed by homosexual activists who are committed to the destruction of the Church.
Your compassion for anti-Catholics and homosexual extremists might be useful in trying to get through to these diseased souls. Just a friendly suggestion for a possible avenue of evangelization.
The important thing to remember
is the faithfulness of the laity have achived this great reprimand and victory over the secularist
priest Fr Unni.
Unlike the Roman Catholic Church which challenges us to reorder ourselves and repent Fr Unni
preaches a regeneration which requires neither repentence nor an inward reordering.

Just redressing the balance Mr O'Malley, just redressing the balance.
Thank you for the Latin form of my username, but when I looked it up, it said something other than shadowlands though?
I love C S Lewis, but in a very amateurish and unlearned way compared to most of his adherents. I've been to his birthplace in Ireland and Oxford and Headington (the Kilns), I prayed at his grave and had a wonderful experience of his presence(peace) and I also knelt in his pew (actually, it was his brother Warnie's seat, I got mixed up). Oh sorry, I've gone down a rabbit hole. Ooops! I do do that. It's from being chased away so often maybe haha!
"I understand this man's pain comes from feeling rejection, but an atheist from out of town using bullying to imply the teachings of the Catholic Church have no place in the Catholic Church is going to get a push back."
I am not meaningfully "from out of town" anymore - I've lived and worked here for years, and I do not see what I have said as "bullying". I have used strong words to express my moral condemnation of the Catholic Church and particularly its current hierarchy, but since I'm in a minority here it's hard to argue I have any power to "bully" others.
I stand by what I have said, and proudly. It is my considered judgment that the RCC causes enormous suffering and misery to millions and is complicity in a criminal coverup of numerous cases of child abuse, torture and (as is coming out now) essentially trafficking and slavery. The current Pope is directly implicated in some of this - we have all seen the offending documents and witnessed the continuing refusal to work with law enforcement.
Given this appalling record I find it hypocritical and rank to the highest degree for the same institution to lecture people like me on sexual morality - a parable involving beams and motes comes to mind.
The stunningly grotesque responses my position has evoked is evidence of real heat around this issue - more heat than I have ever seen expended by a Catholic against the current pedophile-protecting Pope. Priorities, people?
Some here have suggested I'm angry - and to an extent I am. I'm angry at any institution that wallows in injustice and refuses to bring criminals to heel. I'd expect the same anger from any moral person. But I am not consumed with rage. I simply seek a more just world and realize that a certain amount of righteous anger is a useful tool to motivate action.
Further, numerous individuals here have displayed profound ignorance regarding gay and transgender people, confusing transgender people with those who have had a sex change (not the same!) and assuming all gay people engage in anal sex (or 'sodomy') when many do not - believe me, it's a hassle!
I do not believe that when I make love to a partner /partners what I am doing is either "disgusting" or "disordered". Even if it were, it doesn't harm anybody else and gives the participants great pleasure. Even if I accepted Catholic metaphysics (which are backed by zero evidence) it's my choice to live my life as I wish. I expect others to grant me the dignity of allowing me to make my own choices as long as they don't harm others.
To judge and condemn others whom you do not even remotely understand is wicked. To do so with such glee and relish is simply evil.
Not all Catholics behave in this way, and many interpret their faith in such a way that does allow others dignity and freedom. I exempt Joseph from this criticism, for example, because he seems to understand how to engage in a reasonable discussion.
Those who seek to denigrate people like me, and who then attempt to hide behind false horror when someone takes them and the institution they support to task, are acting disingenuously. We are both making moral judgments here: it's just that mine are based squarely in the real world.
shadowlands, we all appreciate and welcome your contributions.
The conversation is lively for sure, but not venomous - even from James at this point.
James,
What you don't realize is, all of us have been in your shoes. Not about this teaching of course, but certainly others.
As a woman, the 'all male priesthood' went right to the heart of my personhood and I felt cast off in similar ways that gays feel. The teachings define who I sleep with, when, how and they even define the quality of that sexual act, in that I must be open to life.
The difference between you and other readers here is, the struggle is over for us. Our love for God grew so deeply that we no longer approach the relationship with selfish desires. Just like in a human relationship, we give things up because He asks us to and we want to please Him. Into His Hands, we commend our spirit.
We understand all too well the feelings you have.
The teachings of Christ's Church are what they are. You have every 'right' to believe whatever the culture wants to lead you to believe. These are your civil rights.
Our Mass is the Holy Sacrifice of Christ, His Passion and His Death and His Resurrection.
Celebrations of who we're sleeping with, in rebellion of Church teaching don't belong there. If you're going to stampede our Sanctuaries insisting we accept what the culture is teaching you, the fur is going to start flying and the priests poisoning the souls in the pew are going to find themselves in an embarrassing position.
It's an internal fight that has to be fought. Please accept our apologies for how the newspapers pick the story up and use it to manipulate your emotions. We have no control over it.
We want the teachings of the Church proclaimed to us and our children and our community. These are the civil rights of Roman Catholics. It's non-negotiable.
btw - You're not going to get any argument from me or anyone here about the internal corruption inside of the Church. What you say is exaggerated, but there are many inside of the Church who are corrupt and downright evil. Many of us are working on that corruption.
Just like the government is stacked to the rafters with the corrupt, that doesn't then vilify the institution itself. Weiners and the perverts like him have nothing to do with our Constitution and three branches of government.
The Roman Catholic Church is the Mystical Body of Christ. The are vultures, thieves and perverts have nothing to do with the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity that Christ left for us.
One must repent and reorder oneself
not look for affirmation from others for our sins and in living below our human nature.
I tried putting batteries in a radio backward and it does not work.
All societies have condemned homosexaulity. Socrates called the a disorder the most unholy of things.
It is a distateful vulgarity to be parading that age old sin and expecting accolades from civil order.
"The conversation is lively for sure, but not venomous - even from James at this point."
Nor has it ever been "venomous" from me, I think. It's interesting the double standards that pervade here.
"The difference between you and other readers here is, the struggle is over for us."
I assure you, I experience no sense of struggle whatsoever. The continual assumption that those with different beliefs are just more or less on the way to believing what you believe is very arrogant. I have a completely different set of premises to you, which I find entirely satisfactory. I don't experience a "struggle" which needs to be resolved.
An essential difference between my position and yours is that mine is more life-affirming. I accept people's choices regarding their own lives, and affirm them when they produce joy and satisfaction. You would have people like me deny themselves happiness for an unsure future reward. It's very very unconvincing.
It's also damaging. Young queer people feel miserable and hated when they hear these messages, regardless how "nicely" they are put. The message that you are inherently disordered and sick is not possible to sugar-coat. Plenty of empirical evidence demonstrates the devastating effects these messages have. Given that the teachings of the RCC regarding homosexuality are not supported by any evidence whatsoever, it is particularly pernicious that they are so forcefully promoted.
Simply put, these teachings harm real people in this life. There is no way that they can be presented that they will not. There is a moral responsibility here to consider the damage that you are doing.
They feel miserable because it is disordered and one will never find happiness there. They hurt themselves but the Church offers the blood of the lamb all we sinners must be washed in.
You have to open your heart to Love and not go around declaring you are better than anyone else.
The Church's teaching are difficult as Chesterton said but not impossibe. It is rather sanity preached to a planet of lunatics.
I was touched and deeply moved by one writer's comments in this blog from Tennessee Williams, a non catholic on the very nature of this compulsion which cries out for help..
Malcolm said: (to me, re visiting the Boston Globe combox))
"Your compassion for anti-Catholics and homosexual extremists might be useful in trying to get through to these diseased souls. Just a friendly suggestion for a possible avenue of evangelization."
I find your description of homosexuals as diseased souls particularly offensive Malcolm, God only knows how hurtful these insulting terms are to the fearfully and wonderfully made creation(God's description of his son or daughter) affected personally by them. Re your suggestion of evangelisation in other comboxes, my asking Catholics to search their own hearts with the light of the Holy Spirit didn't go down too well, why would you suppose I would have more success with non-believers or anti-catholics? If I go there proclaiming a God reconciling man to Himself, yet am unable to be reconciled with you, my fellow brother in Christ, how foolish would that appear? Nope, I'll stick with the calling I feel God has given me. To encourage Catholics and Christians to search their own hearts first, repent to Jesus Christ of any prejudice and ill treatment, through the use of word, action or deed, towards LGBT people, then let homosexuals know that they are loved very dearly, by God and also Our Lady(because that is the truth). Catholics and Christians 'tell' homosexuals to repent, how about we show them, through our witness and acknowledgment of wrong doing first?
If we resist the call to repent as believers, why would we judge non-believers, for doing the same? Maybe through a diseased soul nesting in our own being, eh? I just think it's a good idea to start with the man/woman in the mirror first.
Carol, thanks for providing a forum where a rigorous and humane defense of the Roman Catholic Faith can take place.
Unfortunately, there are factions among us, who believe that a supernatural faith is subject to sexual and political ideologies.
Any deviation from an affirmation of their predilections is met with a political and social campaign to ostracize.
Believing Catholics will not sit by and allow their Faith to be deconstructed by those who would like to eliminate it from the public square.
"If I go there proclaiming a God reconciling man to Himself, yet am unable to be reconciled with you, my fellow brother in Christ, how foolish would that appear?"
It might appear heroic and saintly. Whereas your continuous proclamations of your superior compassion and preternatural moral acuity vis a vis Catholics on this site, who are calling out for truthful representation of Catholic teaching, seems rather staged.
I will leave to God to judge my characterization of "diseased souls".
I'm not quite convinced that you will be passing me through the pearly gates. Cordially.
"I will leave to God to judge my characterization of "diseased souls"."
And will you leave to God too the responsibility for the harm you cause when you use such slurs against fellow human beings? Or do you take moral responsibility for yourself?
James,
when I choose (or the state coerces me) to subject myself to your secular inquisition, I will present myself for re-education.
Till then I stand by my statement.
James, being "queer" is by no means the only "disordered" lifestyle in our culture. I did things in my past that the church considers disordered. I answered the call to amend my ways. If you are an atheist, you probably cannot relate to or accept this, but I was willing to give up my own will for something greater. I would submit to you that in our present political culture, it's more acceptable to be "out of the closet" and sexually active with a member of the same sex than it is to be Roman Catholic. My faith has nothing to do with the men who make up the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. It has everything to do with the Foundation of the Church - Jesus Christ - Who, whether you like it or believe it or not - loves you as much as He loves me. There isn't a person who has commented on this blog who hasn't lifted you up in prayer, I guarantee you. When I was wallowing in sin, I rebuked anyone who prayed for me. I can only thank God they ignored me. You may not think you're suffering, just as I was dead-sure I was happy as a lark doing my own will and thumbing my nose at God. I got out of the burning house in time and I don't want anyone else left behind to perish, even you.
" I've lived and worked here for years, and I do not see what I have said as "bullying". I have used strong words to express my moral condemnation"
"Nor has it ever been "venomous" from me, I think. It's interesting the double standards that pervade here."
James, People here in this forum would say the same thing about their moral condemnation. If you're going to dish it out, you can't go boo-hooing about "damage" somebody's counterpoint is doing.
Big girls and boys discuss things here.
"I assure you, I experience no sense of struggle whatsoever."
You say that like it's a good thing - lol. I can tell you from experience, it isn't good.
"An essential difference between my position and yours is that mine is more life-affirming."
That's your opinion which you are entitled to. For people who believe God is their creator of life and they have surrendered their positions to please Him, we decline opportunities to proclaim your position inside of our Churches. This is the beauty of America and the Constitution.
"I accept people's choices regarding their own lives, and affirm them when they produce joy and satisfaction."
Wow. You accept people's choices regarding their own lives.
Is that right?
Well then, I some wonderful news for you: Catholics choose to produce joy and satisfaction when they teach, live by and affirm the teachings of our Church.
"You would have people like me deny themselves happiness for an unsure future reward. It's very very unconvincing."
Knock yourselves out James.
This controversy is about a Roman Catholic priest who is depriving Catholics in the pews the teaching of the Church and their salvation and making the Memorial Service of Christ's Death on the Cross, Our Sacred Liturgy into something that was a theological seduction.
He has been stopped. He tried to lie his way out of his embarrassment but everybody in the Catholic Church who is faithful to Church teaching now knows what he is. He has deleted the misleading content of his blog on his parish website. He will be watched and recorded. Under a microscope. His goose is cooked. Not only is his goose cooked, several others who have been misleading souls are scurrying around cleaning up their acts.
"It's also damaging. Young queer people feel miserable and hated when they hear these messages, regardless how "nicely" they are put. The message that you are inherently disordered and sick is not possible to sugar-coat. "Simply put, these teachings harm real people in this life. There is no way that they can be presented that they will not. There is a moral responsibility here to consider the damage that you are doing. "
What I've been trying to tell you James is, young queer people aren't alone. They are welcome to join women, single Catholics, Sacramentally married Catholics - all who by accepting the Blessed Body and Blood of Our Lord and saying "AMEN" are renewing their vows to remain in communion with the teachings of the Church.
What isn't welcome are priest who decline to teach Church teaching to extract money out of your wallets. That's what Fr. Unni is, a fundraiser. We are just as vocal about priests withholding the teachings of contraception and abortion - or any other teaching for that matter.
"Given that the teachings of the RCC regarding homosexuality are not supported by any evidence whatsoever, it is particularly pernicious that they are so forcefully promoted.
Your problem with that theory is the body of evidence lying natural law and the biology of reproducing.
As you say above, you are very, very unconvincing!
Shadowland,
I consider anyone caught in the vice of any sin somebody whose soul needs a physician. So did Christ. That is why His Church and His priests are called physicians of the soul.
I don't think anyone has any delusions that an unrepentant an d hardened sinner of any kind has a reservation in hell waiting for them.
The people here know their lives have to stay on course. We are all on our guard watching our flaws and weaknesses and striving not to trip and fall into a temptation.
This thread is about a priest, Fr. Unni, who is passing out poisoned kookaid to Catholics and has them imprisoned at St. Cecelia's in a sick state of the soul.
I didn't see you around during the last few years when we were complaining about the Chancery stealing worker's pensions or the last ten years of any other subject we've taken up. So, let me assure you of something. We're trying to let people out of Fr. Unni's asylum. Next week, should he cook up a plot to have a pride in abortion or gluttony Mass, we'll be right on him.
Thanks for your thoughts. You make some valid points. As James says, there's no way to sugar coat it. The teachings are what they are. I walked out on Our Lord when I was in rebellion against Church teaching, way back when..
Catholics are being robbed of Christ's love and the gifts that come with Sanctifying Grace. Some of us are not sitting by in silence because we see the consequences to friends, family, people we love and more importantly, to Christ.
Some people will make that ugly out of anger or hurt, but those perceptions couldn't be any further than the truth.
Fr. Unni doesn't 'love' anything but the man he sees in the mirror. He is a lost soul.
Joyce, beautifully said.
Thanks to all whose love and zeal for the House of our Lord and souls contributed to this discussion.
Viva Christo Rey!
The Little Way is one of the most eloquent and heartfelt writers I have read in a long time. Thank you to her for her insights.
I have no wish to engage Mr. Croft further but between the wisdom of The Little Way and Carol (always wise and a zealot for the Faith) I hope the true and unadulterated message of the OT and NT sink in and redeem his soul. He is obviously an intelligent and well-spoken man. He will see the Light of Christ eventually. The Lord will wait for him and bring him to Himself. As He does most of us who have wallowed in the solitude of grave sin.
Vivat Christus Rex.
Jack, I very much value your zeal, your humor, your Latin and your love for Christ, His Church and souls.
I love Little Way's gentility. You bring different gifts. I much more think of our journey as a collective effort where we are all learning together, keeping each other on our toes.
Carol,
I have not said anything about your blog post in the negative, nor what you are attempting to do. You say you have not seen ne around when you have done other things. Well, where I have been and what I have been doing ( and the content of my heart whilst doing it) will all be brought into the light one day and shown up for it's worth, or lack of.
You also mentioned;
.'
Well, it is the action of the Holy Spirit, to convert. If you were talking to people such as some(not all) in this combox, I would say it was inspite of their words, rather than because of them, but that just might be my personality. I don't think you need to worry about anyone pussyfooting around here though, we don't seem to be that kind of cat! Jesus does allow us to have and use a personality, along with our faith. He has one Himself! It's not a 'one rule fits all' type of church, that's why people prefer different forms and liturgies I suppose. None of them should supercede the other, if done reverently. Just like people, studies show some are motivated through criticism, some through encouragement. When we encounter people with a view to loving them as Christ does, we will listen to them individually, not lump them all together with a one-off warning. "Do this or burn!" I have sounded like that in the past haha! It didn't work, needless to say. Loving others, as Christ does, even attempting it, is hard work. Learning to love myself is hard enough, then I have to give it away!
'Catholics are being robbed of Christ's love and the gifts that come with Sanctifying Grace. Some of us are not sitting by in silence because we see the consequences to friends, family, people we love and more importantly, to Christ.'
Once again, I affirm your absolute duty and right to do this. Just not at the expense of another losing out to Christ's gift of eternal salvation, for them. I am also not prepared to sit in silence when this happens to homosexuals.
'Some people will make that ugly out of anger or hurt, but those perceptions couldn't be any further than the truth.'
A blatant typed insult is what it is. To suggest homosexuals are 'making out' something is unfriendly due to anger or hurt, is patronizing and unfair. As Catholics, even if we have the truth all sewn up, can utter it perfectly, (in Latin if needs be) without love, it will just burn up, on Judgment day.
My involvement in this combox was to highlight, as a christian, what I hear people (not just homosexuals either) accuse us of. Hatred ( used in mockery, insults, judging) for the person, not the sin.
I wish you well with your campaign to bring about Christ's kingdom, the GOOD NEWS!
Malcolm said:
'.......Whereas your continuous proclamations of your superior compassion and preternatural moral acuity vis a vis Catholics on this site, who are calling out for truthful representation of Catholic teaching, seems rather staged.'
Well, Malcolm I have done a bit of acting in the past, so maybe it clings a little, who knows? It might be one of those 'once a thespian things' darling!
Seriously though, I consider myself a person who IS calling out for truthful representation of catholic teaching. I am DEADLY serious about that!
You also said,
'I will leave to God to judge my characterization of "diseased souls".
Pity you don't leave the judgment of those you perceive diseased, to that same God? It sounds as if God judges you, no-one else, but you judge others. Maybe I am mistaken though?
Oh no, it appears I'm not. You finish, by telling me.....
"I'm not quite convinced that you will be passing me through the pearly gates. Cordially."
Malcolm, we can pass through the pearly gates twice, once on the way in and then again on the way out! So who knows, i might pass you after all.
As for ending with the word cordially, if that's you being cordial, I'm glad I haven't encountered your 'unfriendly'
Whew! Malcolm, your last sentence was really, truly appalling.
PS. What the hell is 'preternatural moral acuity?' It dsounds dead posh, imagine me having that. I might put it in my blog sidebar under...'things I've been called by fellow Romans'.
Praise the Lord and pray the rosary, for ironing out of rough edges.
Actually Carol, I'm getting to feel quite at home here in your blog combox. I think people are beginning to warm to me a little (or maybe they want to set me on fire hahahaha!). I might stop by on a regular basis!
What are we discussing next? I'll read up on it first.
God bless. Praise the Lord!
Shadowlands,
I'm glad you feel welcome! Judging from your responses, you'll have to get used to snark here though. For instance, my reference to you're not being around for the ten years of other subjects wasn't a condemnation of you. (In fact, it might be virtue, LOL.) It was snark. As in the case with this subject, sometimes we get people who need affirmation that there's a bigger picture. And, sometimes, I'm talking something up that doesn't even pertain to you at all.
Do this or you'll burn pretty much captures the essence of the Deposit of Faith! We need both the gentility and people who will speak the truths of our faith with zeal and conviction. Most times, the people who are gentle and loving do not have the personalities to ever bring you to the table of the Deposit of Faith. The beauty of knowing that the Mystical Body works in unison is that we don't have any attachments to being that person's savoir. That role, as you rightfully point out belongs to God.
This is what makes Fr. Unni's problems with the First Commandment stand out like a sore thumb.
Carol,
As I say, I have no opinion, indeed it's none of my business what your blog post is about or what you and the other members do in your own church. My reason for dropping in, was that I felt the faith was being unfairly represented by some and the harmful effect that might have on a person, who from reading parts of his blog, has already encountered more than a lifetimes worth of less than gentle personalities.
"Most times, the people who are gentle and loving do not have the personalities to ever bring you to the table of the Deposit of Faith."
I haven't managed to meet enough gentle and loving christians to know if that is true, but Jesus Christ met with me at the lowest point of my life. I didn't hear shouting, I felt two strong arms lifting me up. Also, when my son was near death, He sent Our Lady. I had asked him, a few weeks earlier to let me get closer to her, if it was his will. He put that request in my heart, I am sure. He knew what was coming.I saw her, inwardly.That's all I know. That's all I can suggest to others to try. His light shining into your heart, it always affirms the person first. Who would dare look into their own heart without knowing of God's available unending mercy? If a non-christian insists that he thinks believers hate him, we must ask ourselves 'why' first, then look to the person asking, rather than deny his view as lies.That's how I see it anyway.
If I have to learn to get used to snarkiness, I may not visit too often. I have a defect of character myself, that I am working on, regards sarcasm, I wouldn't want to indulge it. It wouldn't bear fruit for any of us, ultimately. God knows where he wants me to shout my fourpenneth worth! No, if you all wanted me to stay, your tone would have to be rooted in gentleness and love. Well? No, don't answer that on second thoughts.
I do wish you all well, in your journey, also those you encounter, unbelievers and turned away hearts, as you share what the Lord means and has done, for you.
Also, if any of you are inclined, please pray for my other son, who is being operated on, on Monday. (His heart pacemaker is being removed and re=placed....again!).
Thank you Carol and Jack for your very kind comments. I like to think that we all complement one another with our various gifts in hope of defending the faith and igniting a spark in even the most hardened hearts. The Lord gave me a most profound gift of conversion and like the scene at the end of "Saving Private Ryan", I have to earn it, every day.
God Bless you!
Joyce
Joyce, you're right on with complimenting each other. Depending upon our personality and how entrenched we have become, we need different messages in different ways.
Shadowlands, I'm sorry to hear of your losses and you can count on prayers for your son.
You are preaching to the choir on loving. The urban legend that we 'hate' is coming from the poppycock of people like Fr. Unni.
We get through here on snarky humor, so I'm afraid that won't be changing but we too wish you the best.
Carol,
I didn't mean to mislead you re my second son. He didn't die! He lived. He had a very traumatic brain injury in 2007. He was given the last rites. The priest also prayed for healing. After ten hours of surgery (two ops) he pulled through! against all medical odds. I credit Our Lady's presence there, for his healing.He has had a long recovery including residual epilepsy but passed his degree and is in full time work. Prayer works!
Thanks for the good wishes and prayers for my eldest btw!
Awesome news.
Our Lady rocks.
Shadowlands: Most here are Irish. Snarkiness is in our DNA; hence, we don't understand what others mean by "snark". One thing is clear: we will not be bullied by those who would destroy our faith.
One of the fundamentals of being a Roman Catholic is the recognition that we are all "diseased souls" in
need of God's Grace.
I will bet Fr Unni says nothing
about Confession.
Shadowlands,
"Malcolm I have done a bit of acting in the past, so maybe it clings a little, who knows? It might be one of those 'once a thespian things' darling!"
Besides by me gran and raspy voiced waitresses, I haven't been called darling in ages.
"Pity you don't leave the judgment of those you perceive diseased, to that same God? It sounds as if God judges you, no-one else, but you judge others. Maybe I am mistaken though?"
You hold me in much too high esteem, if my "judging", gets you down so much. I am not competent to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to anyone's eternal soul.
However, I will not shirk from describing persons who are consumed with hatred towards the RCC, as "diseased souls". As I initially said, I believe that to be consumed by hatred and vileness towards the RCC is a spiritual sickness. You should note that I did not attribute this vileness as an innate characteristic of their homosexuality. It's an aspect of their crippled humanity (oh, my goodness forgive me, their "disabled" humanity.) A hetero anti-Catholic is similarly a diseased soul. A raging racist is a diseased soul. A vicious misogynist is a diseased soul. The denier of the homosexual's unique personhood is a diseased soul. I'm quite liberal in use of the term.
"You finish, by telling me....."I'm not quite convinced that you will be passing me through the pearly gates. Cordially."
My unfortunate sentence structure may have caused a misunderstanding in this instance. It isn't reflective of my competence to "judge", in the sense of the fate of your eternal soul. It was denying that you will hold a Saint Peter role in passing me through the pearly gates. So, I'm not trying to keep you out of heaven. I don't expect to see you controlling the gate. Snarky? Probably. Appalling?
"Woe to him who seeks to please rather than apall"...Melville
"Preternatural moral acuity": moral insight that is below the abilities of God, but on a footing with the angels. It's a damn good phrase. Words are there to be used. I'm not ashamed of using them.
"As for ending with the word cordially, if that's you being cordial, I'm glad I haven't encountered your 'unfriendly'"
I can't remember who, someone used to send liturgical post cards to atheist Ayn Rand, in order to send her into a tizzy. It's in that vein, that I use the word "cordially". I am trying to get under your skin, but not in a nasty way. There's a difference.
Father Unni: "snarky blogs...cause serious harm...Take a look at any opinionated religious blog.... and you’ll see all manner of terrible name-calling".
Shadowlands:"If I have to learn to get used to snarkiness, I may not visit too often."
Her Master's Voice.
Hesketh
God bless you.
Unni brought this all upon himself.
He seems now to be posturing as a
bit of a dolt pretending he knew not what was going on.
This was a real win for laity in
keeping the local Church in line
with Church teachings from those
seeking self applause and no healing.
Shadowlands:
I'll take the blessing. But I think you misinterpreted me.
"Her Master's Voice" refers to that classic RCA Victor ad- the dog listening in awe to his master's voice coming from a Victrola. See:
I sense organized outrage in your postings.
Hesketh,
No, I didn't misinterpret you, I've seen your comments on others blogs in the past. I am quite familiar with your style and tone.
I was following 1 Peter 3:9.'s advice:
"Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing."
'I sense organized outrage in your postings.'
Nothing organised about my outrage, it's totally disorganised!
I'm not on other blogs.
Perceiving evil in a critical posting, that's a little over the top.
I'll pray you don't go down the road of Young Goodman Brown.
Hesketh
Insult.
I perceived insult.
Had I not quoted the whole verse, I might have been accused of editing the text. I was accused of this earlier in the thread by someone else re the catechism, quite an accusatory place infact, for some..
"I'll pray you don't go down the road of Young Goodman Brown."
I don't imagine you will pray for me Hesketh, somehow. However, perhaps when you've finished analysing my soul's possible final end, you might offer a prayer for my son though? If you are a believer, that is? You've told me so much about me, yet said so little about yourself.
I'm happy to have been downgraded from a focus of evil to Don Rickles.
Believe it or not, I will pray for your son. I began at Mass this AM.

We don’t go out to eat that often, but when we do, we usually go to the local Mexican joint down the road. Our favorite place closed last year. The friendliest family ran it. They were always so great with Andrew, the food was always good – we just loved them. They moved on to another part of the country to start a new venture, and left me with no Mexican eats locally (outside of my home, of course) for about 6 months. In desperation one day, I browsed Mexican restaurants in our vicinity on Yelp. To my surprise, one turned up in a town nearby – a nice 30 minute drive on the back roads. I must admit I was leery, as Crisfield is known primarily for it’s seafood (blue crabs, oysters, etc). I wondered how good could this place be? I’d never heard of it. But, like I said, I was desperate. So, one night, we ventured up.
We were blown away with the dinner we got at that little hole in the wall place. The proprietor/chef hails from South America, so there are lots of great Latin options – as well as traditional Tex Mex fair. While a new place has opened up closer by, we still try to make the trip to Mi Pueblito whenever we can. My favorite thing on the menu is the black bean soup. So simple, yet so flavorful and filling. Nice and smoky from the ham hock, and rich silkiness that only black beans can lend.I always devour the whole bowl, then have very little room for dinner. I made a batch last weekend at home in an effort to recreate their version, and it is right on point. As with other soups, it was even better the second day for lunch. The pico de gallo on top is optional, but highly recommended. It adds a great pop of color and flavor!
Black Bean Soup
1 pound dried black beans, soaked in 4 quarts of water overnight, drained
1 pound smoked ham hock or shank (1 large bone)
2 bay leaves
8 cups water
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped fine
1 teaspoon salt
4 medium garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chile powder
juice of 1 lime
Sour cream
pico de gallo (for garnish)
Heat olive oil in large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions, and saute until starting to brown on the edges, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add beans and ham hock to the pot, followed by 8 cups water, bay leaves, and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a low simmer. Cover and let cook at least 3 hours, until beans are tender. Remove bay leaves and ham hock from the pot. Add cumin and chili powder, and stir to combine. Cook for another hour on low.
Remove 4 cups of the soup (about half of it) to a blender. Purée until smooth and return to the pot of soup. Or, if you have an immersion blender, feel free to use that to achieve the desired consistency. I wanted mine nice and smooth. Add lime juice, stir to combine. Season with salt to taste. Top with a dollop of sour cream and pico de gallo.

It’s the ham hock that is KEY…It imparts sooooo much yummy flavor!!! Love me some black bean soup
I’ve never actually had black bean soup before, but this looks great!
I ve never eaten anything like this before… looks really interesting!
Oh the horror of not having a Mexican restaurant close by! I’m not sure what I would do since that is usually my first choice on the rare occasion we go out. I’m glad you found one, though.
Your black bean soup sounds perfect! I love the pico de gallo on top…I always need a little tomato and pepper with my black bean soup.

Everytime they consume cereal for breakfast, they finish it off together by drinking their milk from the bowl just like this.
In unison.
Quite frankly, I there are some who would say this is a display of poor manners.
Me? I say this is hilarious and it shows how much these two are joined at the hip, even with their age differences.
So thanks Grammie for teaching them this ;).

DISCLAIMER: I’m copying and pasting a lot of this, so don’t hold it against me.
Come summer, this is one of those foods that is always in short supply, especially in my house. Now, we have a way to “rapidly” make these, but somehow, we always seem to run out.
It’s hard to find a low-calorie, low-sodium, gluten-free recipe that the whole family will consistently like, and this one definitely hits the mark.
The one thing I particularly like about this recipe (in addition to its short overall time) is that it’s SO simple, even your non-reading kids can do it. Granted, they may need some supervision so there isn’t a huge mess, but that’s kind of par for the course with kids in the kitchen. And, distracted teenagers can usually make these, too, without burning down the house.
Enjoy! (and be sure to read all the comments!)

Tila's "Wigging" Out!!
Today the bobbleheaded mutt is so "subtly" trying to bait you mean ol' haters into calling the police on her again.
Now, I KNOW you all are SO EXCITED to see the "picture" she's talking about, right?! The BEST part of this picture is that she actually thinks that she's going to pass this picture off as a "current" picture. Notice the fucked up wig. Someone like Tila loves to post pictures of herself and when people love who they are they love nothing more than to post the most recent and up to date photos ... that is ... IF they look good. You see, Tila has no real recent photos and the most recent ones that she DOES have we've picked apart and talked about how meth-face and strung out she looks. So what does she do? She goes and finds the ones of her with the platinum wig so that she can try and pass it off as something current. Cute ... really, it is. Check out the date on that bitch:
Here Tila, I figured you might want some recent photos posted being as that it seems you're a bit shy about how you look right now. It's okay, your army will love you no matter how you look, right?
Courtesy: MissTilaOMG
I'm sure her "lawl-yer" keeps giving her this mind-blowing advice to keep baiting everyone that she claims to be so fearful of. If so, she should
19 comments:
HO-LEE-SHIT!!! Warn a sista before you post Tilas current phots. I haven't laughed till I peed in a long long long time!!!! I knew that photo wasn't current. I've said it a million times over there to her, She has a bunch of computer nerds that can call her on her bullshit when she posts lame old shit. I said it when she posted that bullshit last week when she was called on it. And she's dumb enough to keep doing it.
I know you read the comments here Tila. Give it up already.
I haven't studied law but isn't there something about keeping your trap shut during an investigation or impending court case?
I would think her MOST POW-ER=FUL ATTORNIES at this point, would have advised their client to cease addressing the "haterz" and keep it on the DL on the blog until everything came to light, you know...papers being served, people arrested, etc etc.
I'm interested to see how this storyline ends...what will be the excuse when there is no case and nobody goes to jail? or will she just claim they did and now she is going after the people that took their place...
the ongoing battle of Tila and her army of mentally gifted minors!
oh lawd.
You know she looks like that IRL. Lol, it's funny how she tweeted that she was gonna eat a turkey burger last night. I guess she was able to save enough money over the weekend to eat something else besides ramen sprinkled with fairy dust.
Bwahahahaha at her tits in that red belt. OMG I think I may have peed myself laughing! What else do we have here? Contacts and fake lashes? Check. Tan in a can? Check. Ghetto nails for a klassy touch? Check. Plastic Barbie hair? Check.
She is the epitome of understated elegance.
PS: Looks like Hope had the same reaction I did, LOL!
Bwahahahaha she looks like my best friend Seths Bubie. Seriously, I just told him he had to come and look at this and he is rolling on the floor because it looks so much like her.
She is so dumb she doesn't realize all her antics harm the potential of her gossip blog to be anything but train-wreck watch.
If she is already resorting to this to drive people to her website, think of what she'll have to do next. My guess is sex tape leak.
Oh God, her boobs look absolutely disgusting in that second picture. I'm definitely going to have to claw my eyes out after that disgusting shit. Rotty, prepare yourself, for I'm going to contact Tila's oh-so "POWerful lawyers" and sue you for causing me such distress.
Livvey,
Been there, done that.
So she threatened to sue them if they didn't take it down. She claimed it was stolen off of her laptop that got stolen once. NOW SHE SAYS IT ISN'T HER.
You can totally find the articles about it on TMZ. So much for being a big ol' lesbian, huh?
Eduardo,
I can't check the link because I'm on my work computer and that link scares me!
So we have:
Leaked sex tape. Check.
Proclaiming a mental disorder. Check.
Faked a suicide. Check.
Sex tape. Check.
It's pretty scary what lengths she will go to for people to notice her.
Oops, I put in one too many sex tapes.
I guess I'm just trying to be a psychic.
Holy shit on the last photos hahahaha. I about died. I really like the added "belts".
Thats from when she had those dumb handcuffs and shit on her nails, they are old.
Dude...those last pictures are so gnarly. I honestly have no more words, and now I have to go dry my eyes from the gagging.
Shes posting old photos on Myspace too, back when her hair was long and brown. She looked ALOT more healthy IMHO.
She tried that bait shit last night when she tweeted she STOLE an exclusive from TMZ on the Mary Jane Girls/Rick James and put it on her piece of crap gossip site. I made a comment about it on a prior post.
The skank probably don't have any money to pay Mr Vo or whatever his name is to re-bleach her hair and it looks like a hideous rat's nest or she looks so bad she's ashamed to take a current picture knowing even if she photoshopped it, it still would come out looking beyond bad.
My god, her boobs look painful. I can't believe she didn't rupture one of those back-alley saline bags while she was rolling around on the red carpet.
And what the fuck is that crap on her nails?? It looks like hardened frosting.
Oh God, I peed a little. That shit is so wrong! LMBAO!
Ewww; My eyes! :(.
On a 2nd note, LMFAO bobblehead!
I was listening to a song called that no too long ago: "Christina Aguilera - Bobblehead."
Instantly made me think of Tila :].
The shit should be her theme song.
Ha ha....I am out of words...great Job guys:)

<< THREATEN US SOME MORE ~ MAIN ~ EFFORT MADE TO BE SMART >>
Page 23, chapter four of the Stern Report:
Gender inequalities will likely worsen with climate change.
UPDATE. Climate change will also cause forced marriage.
(Via Joe Cambria)
Link to article
World Ends - Women, Minorities Hardest Hit.
Etc etc
Wait, I’m confused, hotter climates mean less clothing ipso facto, less burkhas and less inequality. Wait, this is bad, hotter weather means more laying on the couch asking the better half for more beer, which leads to more smiting from Gaia and more inequality. I’m so confused / hand wringing.
I forsee a Department of Climate Change.
There will be training, seminars, conferences, meetings. Lots of meetings.
#4, there already is: Australian Greenhouse Office
They’ve been given so much money from the government that they’re flat out spending it by attending seminars and conferences all around the world and they’ve still got plenty left over.
While we’re on the Stern report, I’m hoping to see some serious rebuttals soon. The report relies on some numbers from the IPCC that have already been comprehensively debunked.
Don’t heed stern warning
When Stern was chief economist at the World Bank he got into an argument with the formidable former commonwealth statistician, Ian Castles, over the inappropriate use of statistics in the bank’s development report (on emissions, as it happens), an argument Castles seems to have won.
From a quick look on the web today, Castles and others really got stuck into earlier drafts of the Stern report and their criticisms don’t appear to have been refutted or accommodated.
Every time I think the globalwarmacoolichanging thing has reached the height of absurdity, I see something like this. How long until they tell us global warming will shrivel our penises?
Wikipedia’s entry on Niagara Falls says that increased mist from the Falls that obscures the view from the Canadian side may be a result of global warming. I shit you negative.
I think that the concensus has fucking lost it.
Inequality? I would’ve though warming would mean more hot chicks.
It’s true! If women no longer need to put their feet on us to keep them warm while they sleep, what good are we to them?
Wish I had a link to the ‘report’ which argued - seriously - that global warming was worse for women because they were less likely than men to be able to swim. In fact, here it is.
Although he hasn’t yet weighed in on the Stern thread, Ian Castles has been a regular contributor to the comments over at Climate Audit. Climate Audit being the often very technical blog of Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, of Hockey Stick debunking fame (and well worth a look).
It means that when we cycle back to global coldening, dem bitches is gonna hog ALL the blankets…
#9 It’s okay, blogagog, as long as there are rubbish bins to be put out, spiders to be killed and VCRs to be programmed, I am indispensable to women.
Why didn’t Mr Gay write this report? Then people wouldn’t worry so much.
Hot Dogs up late game show is possibly caused by global warming
who said there’d be no consequences - huh, HUH???
#5; Art, Tim Worstall also has some criticisms that might be worth checking out.
Meanwhile, I’ll do my bit to keep the globe cooler; I’ll keep the airconditioner running flat out!
You know what the real elephant in the living room is here? With all these reams of reports on global warming, nobody says whether or not it’ll be a dry heat. That’s really crucial to the argument, I think.
#13: “#9 It’s okay, blogagog, as long as there are rubbish bins to be put out, spiders to be killed and VCRs to be programmed, I am indispensable to women.”
Hmmm. The trash is usually outside already when I get home from work, Mrs. Paco feeds bugs to Paco Jr’s pet lizard with her bare hands, and she’s a VCR-programming whiz, as well as an excellent self-taught electrician and plumber. Must preserve illusion of indispensability!
Hey, look, honey! I tied my shoes all by myself, again!
Obviously, Howard Stern is only worried about the future lesbian employment situation as it relates to his own financial well being and shouldn’t be taken at face value. It is a statement from Howard Stern, isn’t it?
You tie your own shoelaces? What did you have Paco Jr for, then?
For me, shoelace tying is a just compensation for being a bit slow working out what was the cause of offspring in hte first place.
#8 Habib said - I would’ve though warming would mean more hot chicks.
#6 Dave S. said - How long until they tell us global warming will shrivel our penises?
Yeah, but what good is one, without the other?
#21 Like tighty-whities, global warming will make men less potent. So, no pitter-patter of little carbon footprints for you.
#4 SingleMalt
“I forsee a Department of Climate Change”.
Too late.Bob Brown proposed that John Howard set up exactlt that department yesterday.
And you thought you were being droll….
(Reminds me of John Cleese’s Ministry of Silly Walks)
And who says a warmer planet is bad anyhow…?
I like the basic assumption of the Stern report. It’s like saying that if you stop on a level crossing and make no effort to get off the tracks that it is inevetable that you will suffer a catastrophic train impact.
#2 There has been for decades. Environment Canada has been working on Climate Change for at least 15 years now. There are whole departments and bureaucracies and careers that depend upon global warming funding.
The whole thing is a complete hoax to keep bureaucrats and jet-setters well fed and travelled.
That should have been #4 not #2. I see from #5 that Australia already has its own collection of parasites.
#6 Omigod, global warming will lead to increased evaporation from Viagra falls and no one will be able to get it up. Earth stops due to change in angular momentum brought on by BusHitler scheme to deny Big Bird her bananas.
We are doomed! We are all going to die!
I can’t focus on climate change. Not with rioting and looting in the cities, the international banking and finance system in tatters, raw sewage running down the streets of our darkened cities and airplanes falling out of the sky everywhere…
Just give us a chance to get over the Y2K catastophe.
Very OT, but lame-o ‘youth’ (i.e. thirtysomething) comedy show The Glass House has been axed. This show is the poster-child for publicly funded, smug, unreflective, Howard- and Christian-bashing ‘humour’ on our ABC. The stars are said to be ‘distressed’ and ‘devastated’. First time anything about that show has ever made me laugh.
Well, I’ll be…
I guess it makes sense. We have one side of the economy making stuff and the other side geared to not making stuff (or having a meeting about not making stuff).
It has a symmetry about it.

Hey, wait a minute! How come I’m doing all that stuff for myself? What gives?
*Looks at Mr. H*
Trouble is, I tend to kill the spider by hitting it with the VCR, after which I have to throw it in the rubbish bin.
Paco, you should wear blundstone boots, no shoelaces just pull them on and go;)
Catfish tend to be tropical- imagine when they start pouring down the east coast of Australia, and all the meat women have to start covering up at the beach- then you’ll be sorry.

I suggest a smallish water diversion project. That ought to leave one helluva rock climbing “experience” once the Falls are gone. At least it’s somethin’ to do if blogagog’s worst fears come true.
What, in this feminised world of positive discrimination, men will be even worse off? Surely not…

I’m getting confused.
BTW, there was a dingbat in the letters section of the Oz extolling the example of the planetary action over Y2K to push the same reaction to global warmy/coldy/dry-y/wetty whatever the fucks going on:-
AS we approached the new millennium, Y2K became the most important thing facing the world and billions were spent to ensure that our computer-dependent world was prepared. The Y2K bug hardly rates when one looks at the monetary and human cost global warming will have on everyone on the planet, and yet we have John Howard and George W. Bush unprepared to acknowledge the enormity of the problem. Even the latest dire warning on global warming by former World Bank economist Nicholas Stern has barely made a dent in the PM’s reluctance to acknowledge that global warming is a reality.

So by this reasonning, because idiot governments and cretinous business management got suckered with a world-wide con in 1999, we should repeat the performance and get our wallets hoovered by some spivs by panicking over another flim flam.
Evolution is a myth- humanity getes stupider by the nanosecond.
While we’re on the Stern report, I’m hoping to see some serious rebuttals soon.
This is a question I ask all the time.
Does your data take into consideration water vapor?
Water vapor, responsible for 95% of Earth’s greenhouse effect, is 99.999% natural (some argue, 100%). Even if we wanted to, we can do nothing to change this.
Adding up all anthropogenic greenhouse sources, the total human contribution to the greenhouse effect is around 0.28%
[Kyoto], even if imposed equally on all countries around the world, would reduce total human greenhouse contributions from CO2 by about 0.035%.
This is much less than the natural variability of Earth’s climate system!

I’m just wondering whether we’ll hear the usual suspects warning about the dangers of surrendering our freedoms in the face of fear.
You know the kind of thing: If we start profiling at airports then the terrorists have won, etc, etc
I’m just guessing our hard won rights to drive cool cars and eat whatever the Hell we like may be under threat. I don’t see too much beard stroking over what promises to be the mother of all erosions of liberty?
A quote from the Stern Report:
Gender inequalities will likely worsen with climate change. ... A particular burden will be imposed [on them] ... leaving women vulnerable to impoverishment, forced marriage, labour exploitation and trafficking.
So climate change is the new Islam?
Time for a new look at the whole phenomenon- could global warming be being caused by all those hot and horny Moslem males radiating randy energy?
I’m for terrestrial sequestration to mitigate the effects.

The whole thing is a complete hoax to keep bureaucrats and jet-setters well fed and travelled.
In my view it is part of communism’s ongoing culture war agaimst the West.
Part of the how can we make them hate themselves and slow down their damn economies campaign, alongside the left’s attacks on Western culture, history, patriotism, etc.

I read your link. Contrast that to the screed written at the “forced marriage” link provided above by Tim.
I have a problem here. The commenters at “The road to Smur.. er… Surfdom” think everyone at “Tim Blair” are “smartarse idiot morally vacuous warbloggers”; so just what do you think you’re doing bringing incontrovertible science into this??? Shame! How in tarnation will Tim’s commenters ever live up to our hard-earned reputations?
By the way, is that Surfdom(sic) as in “surfdom-and-turfdom”? Like when I take my wife out for a steak-and-lobster dinner.
Heck, I’ve been working like a serf lately… better hit the rack.
P.S. Any chance this Stern geezer is correct? Because if he is, I won’t have to shovel 6 feet of snow this winter in 35-below-zero temperature. Again… like I’ve been doing most winters for decades.
you might want to close those tags Joe, italics don’t grow on trees.
UPDATE. Climate change will also cause forced marriage.
I don’t believe the Stern Report addresses the question everyone wants answered: will we see cats and dogs living together?

You have to hand it to the people who came up with global warming/climate change/end of the world from carbon spewing capitalism.

Another quote from the report, quoted on “Road to Surfdom”
Women are also particularly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters with women and children accounting for more than 75% of displaced persons following natural disasters.
Hmmm. Consider a 3 generation family: nanna and pop, their two adult kids, with spouses, and the two offspring each of the adult pairs have produced. You finish up with 7 women and children to only 3 men (or 70% of the population).
Kill off pop because pops usually don’t live as long as nannas do. That brings the women and children population to 78%. Add more kids per generation and the percentage of women and children just keeps going up and up whether or not there’s a natural disaster. And remember that natural disasters include such things as earthquakes and volcanic explosions which, last I heard, have nothing to do with global warmening.
This bloke’s alarmism is contemptible.
And, frankly, if I’m caught up in a natural disaster and I survive more or less uninjured then I won’t be sitting around waiting for some bloke to do the necessary for me. Unless male level brawn is both necessary and useful being female does not render me less than capable of looking after myself.
So, wait, lefties are FOR forced marriage, near-slave like conditions for women, and all that when caused by Islam, but AGAINST the very same things when “caused” by climate change?
Color me confused.

Thanks Tim for that last link update
The posts there are rather amazingly twisted and one caught my eye:
This is part of Mr z’s comment
I was going to post a comment in response to this at Blair’s, but after reading the number of commenters on the linked post there who stated their wish for the mass-executions of ‘leftists’ as a response to climate change, while simultaneously calling the eco-aware “fascists”, I decided not to waste my time
Really?
I can’t remember seeing you all post about mass executions!
Or do the regulars here have some kind of code? That I haven’t worked out yet?
Wish I had a link to the ‘report’ which argued - seriously - that global warming was worse for women because they were less likely than men to be able to swim.
Poppycock. Not only do we know how to swim, our increased body fat makes us eminently more floatable.
Here’s an example of how well-researched and solidly presented this report is.. [113]
[113] is a reference to this lovely paper: ‘Caught in the storm: impact of natural disasters on women’. San Fransisco, CA: Global Fund for Women.
And that paper takes its reference from this poorly-cited article: Most tsunami dead female - Oxfam
So that “women and children account for more than 75% of displaced persons following natural disasters” is inferred from an Oxfam report on a couple of villages in Aceh following the tsunami.
I kinda think that if that witless child Tim Blair and his minions vanished from the blogosphere the average IQ across the board would rise considerably.
Ooo, I would so love to have a dueling IQs contest with blogosphere left. Bring it on.

Dear Climate Mufti:
I will shortly be attending a conference on Climate Change Activism in a far part of the world. Since the Jew manipulators have done away with all the sailing ships, I will be forced to travel there by airplane. I know that our spiritual leader Monbiot (pbuh) has declared airplanes unclean; can you tell me, O Tim, if there is any ritual by which the plane may be made clean and suitable for use of the faithful?
What is it with lefties and math? Are they all innumerate?
How long until they tell us global warming will shrivel our penises?
Don’t you think that’s already the problem for many of the climate alarmists, Dave?
#9 It’s okay, blogagog, as long as there are rubbish bins to be put out, spiders to be killed and VCRs to be programmed, I am indispensable to women.
I put out my own trash, kill my own spiders, know how to program a VCR and don’t have cold feet. Now, why do I need you men? Oh yeah, now I remember…
It is a statement from Howard Stern, isn’t it?
Yes.
And who says a warmer planet is bad anyhow…?
Indeed. As with any change, there will be winners and losers. Seems like North America will be one of the winners (our neighbor to the north already is counting the extra revenue derived from its increased agricultural capacity and extended growing season). How’s that for a kick in the teeth, ecofascists? The biggest polluter and most egregious waster of global resources is likely to benefit and profit from a slightly warmer planet (and remember, we know how to turn a buck from almost anything). But with that Anartic ice sheet supposedly expanding and all, I am a little worried about you guys Down Under.

As a marine zoologist I studied all of these global environmental trends 4 decades ago. They were predicted and predictable, and there were solid scientific reasons for them. I’ve seen nothing to change my mind.
That was until the illiberal godawful greenies made a religion out of them.
Is it getting warmer. Yes. It’s supposed to. In about 200 years it’ll start getting cooler. It’s supposed to. It’s a 500 year cycle overlaid on a 1500 year cycle overlaid on a 10,000 year cycle overlaid on a 100,000 year cycle overlaid on a million year cycle. And don’t forget to throw in the 11 year solar cycle. It’s even got a name…Milankovitch Theory from 1842 for Gods sake.
From a more empirical standpoint, think about the Currier and Ives etchings - Deep snow in London all winter in the mid 1800s. That corresponds to the low point in the temperature swings. Think about Chaucer’s writings - it was much warmer in England at his time - much much warmer than now. The swings are regular and predictable.
Globular Warmening is a joke and no serious scientist (i.e., one not dependent on moonbats for money) will sign on to it.

Q.: I bought several poinsettias during the Christmas season to use as decorations. Several of my friends and family said they were poisonous and dangerous to have around my animals and small children. Is this true? Should I avoid buying them in the future? Also, I noticed that the blooms look like colored leaves. Do the leaves develop into blooms? If they are safe, how can I keep them from dying so quickly? Mine already look sick.
Hannah C.
A.: Poinsettias can be mildly toxic, but it is a myth that they are extremely poisonous to people and animals. This myth apparently dates back to 1919 when a two-year old child erroneously was reported to have died of ingesting poinsettia leaves. Snopes, the urban legend watchdog, as well as several government agencies, health groups, veterinary groups and plant experts, agree that it is a myth that poinsettias are deadly to children and pets. Snopes says that The American Medical Association’s “Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants” indicates that ingesting poinsettia leaves may cause occasional vomiting.
The ASPCA Animal Poison Center on its website says that poinsettias are mildly toxic to animals. The American Veterinary Medicine Association of America says: .”
Poinsettias have been used as Christmas decorations for many years. The actually bloom is the small yellow part of the colorful area. The colorful parts of the “bloom” are actually leaves called bracts. With proper care, they will be attractive for several weeks.
When transporting them from the nursery to your home, try to keep them from becoming chilled if it is below 50 degrees. When you get them home, place them in bright light, but don’t allow the leaves to touch the cold windows. They prefer a cool place (60-70 degrees) away from drafts and heat vents.
Poinsettias prefer slightly dry soil. If they are in foil paper, check it to be sure water has not collected in it. If they sit in water for a long period, the roots will rot. Let the soil dry between waterings. After a few weeks, they will start to fade and look bad. Because, it is a lot of trouble to get the characteristic coloring, which makes the poinsettia so attractive, most people use them as annuals and replace them the next year.
If you do decide to try to get one to bloom the next year, there are several steps you need to take. Remove any dead leaves and place the plant to into bright light, preferably a south- or east-facing window. Remove the foil and place it in a saucer. Cut the stems back about half and fertilize it with half strength houseplant fertilizer in January and every four weeks until April. In April the bracts will begin to die. At this time, cut the stems back to 4 or 6 nodes.
When the weather warms, it can be placed outside either in a pot or in your garden. In the garden with proper fertilization it many grow to as large as 4 or 5 feet in width and height. Any houseplant fertilizer used at the recommended rate should work. It will need to be cut back at least twice during the summer to keep it small enough to bring back into the house in the fall.
Poinsettias are tropical plants and will die if they get too cold, so they must be mechanically manipulated in this area to induce them to bloom. To bloom, poinsettias much receive the same amount of light as they would in nature. Walter Reeves recommends covering them with a cardboard box for 14 hours a day beginning in late September. Any type of light during the 14 hours can disrupt the blooming process. Water them normally and leave them outdoors until it turns cool. Then move them indoors, continuing to cover them for 14 hours a day until early November. You should then begin to see buds appear at the ends of each branch. Then keep the plant in a cool, bright window and hopefully you will have colorful bracts in time for the holidays.
For more information on poinsettias, contact the Carroll County Office of the UGA Extension Service, 770-836-8546.

Mandissa Marshall was looking forward to the indoor season competing in the pole vault with the George Mason women's track team. She was red-shirted last winter to get ready for the outdoor season, but was planning for a big spring this season.
Mandissa had a major setback this fall when she ran through on a jump and twisted her ankle, pole vault coach Kevin McGorty said. It has been a long and slow recovery and she has missed a lot of base training.
Senior Marshall (Crestwood), who holds the George Mason record indoors (13-1½), will take it slowly because the outdoor season has been outstanding for her. Not only does she hold the school record (14-1¼), but she's won two straight Colonial Athletic Association Championship titles, was the top finisher in the NCAA Division I East Regionals two straight years and earned All-American mention as a sophomore.
We are doing our best to get her back into jumping form but we will also be very mindful of her injury, McGorty said. Unfortunately, an injury like this really just needs time to heal properly and to regain strength.
Marshall didn't compete in the first two meets of the season and is doubtful when the college hosts the Patriot Games this Friday and Saturday in Fairfax, Va.
The injury was really bad timing because she was hoping for a super indoor season, McGorty said. I expect to see solid performances in the few meets she enters, but nothing beyond that and we will continue to evaluate her training on a week-by-week bases.
KRAMER'S CLICKING – Senior Brianna Kramer of Drums (MMI Prep) kicked off the indoor track season for the Ursinus women's team in the Collegeville Classic last Friday. She helped the DMR finish second (13:10.85) and the 4x400 finish fifth (4:17.66). Individually, she was 13th out of 58 runners in the 800 in a time of 2:31.79.
Brianna has really blossomed the past year as an athlete, coach Chris Bayless said. Somewhere along the way something clicked and she is responding to the training we are doing and her times are dropping.
Kramer was one three school record-breaking relay teams last year to kick off the process.
Her attitude changed dramatically enough that she was named a captain this past fall and she made her first cross country regional team, Bayless said. I'm excited to see how she progresses this indoor and outdoor season.
The Bears return to action in the Thomson Invitational Saturday at the University of Delaware.
FAZZINI A HOT SHOT – Stonehill senior Adam Fazzini (Crestwood) ranked third in NCAA Division II in three-point shooting percentage in the latest statistics. The 6-foot-4, 205-pound guard had shot 50 percent (38-for-76). His percentage dropped a tad (48.7) after missing his only two attempts in a 68-62 loss to Le Moyne last Saturday. He finished with six points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal and was in foul trouble most of the game.
On the season, Fazzini is averaging 10.7 points and 4.1 rebounds for the Skyhawks, who are 7-8 overall and 3-8 in the Northeast-10 Conference. In a two-game stretch, he hit nine of 16 three-point attempts against New Haven (loss) and St. Rose (win).
HOOK HELPING WILDCATS – The first season that Justine Hook played for the Bay Path women's basketball team, the Wildcats finished 0-25. Since then, Hook has helped the team gain respect and this season, Bay Path is 8-6 overall and 5-3 and in title contention in the New England Collegiate Conference.
Hook, from Berwick (Columbia-Montour Vo-Tech), is averaging 11.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists. The 5-foot-7 junior guard had 22 points in a 68-46 victory over Pine Manor, 17 points in a 68-46 triumph over Newbury and 16 points in a 70-61 victory over Becker.
Justine is in her third season as a starter and she's been selected as team captain for the third straight year, coach Jill Shaw said. Pep, as she's known in Wildcat country, began the season at the point, but has since transitioned to shooting guard and that serves her quite well.
Hook is among the league leaders in three-point shooting – she has 23 – but the coach is quick to point out that first of all, she's a team player.
Pep will do whatever it takes for us to be successful, Shaw said. She leads by example on the court, both in games and in practice. She is just a great kid and a pleasure to coach.
LEVERY A KEY RESERVE – The Marywood women's basketball team is off to a fine start – 10-7 overall and 7-1 in the Colonial States Athletic Association. And 6-foot sophomore center Maddie Levery (Meyers) is seeing key minutes off the bench for the Pacers. She's averaging 2.4 points with 27 rebounds and has three steals and three blocked shots. She had four points and five rebounds in a 64-50 victory over Rosemont last Saturday in Scranton.
Maddie has been a great spark for us off the bench, coach Tara Macciocco said. She is a terrific shooter and is becoming a great defensive rebounder. We will be looking for her to give us a lot more minutes down the stretch.
LAMPART FITTING THINGS IN – Senior Kyle Lampart (Hazleton Area) is competing with the St. Joseph's men's indoor track team. At last weekend's Delaware Invitational, he finished fourth in the 800 (2:12.50) and helped the 4x400 relay finish second.
Kyle is a great guy who is currently trying to juggle the results of a fall training season that was interrupted by a worthwhile internship that left him too little time to train, coach Michael Glavin said. Hopefully his spring schedule will be a big more flexible.
Lampart is one of the veterans on the team.
Kyle needs and deserves to have a great senior indoor and outdoor season after the four years of hard work he's put in, Glavin said.
BULL READY FOR ACTION – After a strong season with the Gettysburg cross-country team in the fall, freshman Abby Bull (Berwick) is looking to compete in her first indoor track meet.
Bull finished 55th out of 346 runners with a 6k time of 24:12.3 at the NCAA Division III Mid-East Regionals and prior to that was 35th out of 113 runners (23:12.1) at the Centennial Conference Championships.
She's ready to go this weekend, coach Aubrey Shenk, the Bullets competing in the Thomson Invitational at the University of Delaware Saturday in Newark.
Bull competed in all events from the mile up to the 5,000 at Berwick.
We look for Abby to compete in the long distance events this indoor season, Shenk said.
FRANK ADJUSTING – Sophomore Mary Frank (Holy Redeemer) is competing with the Pittsburgh women's indoor track team. She finished 31st in the 3,000 meter run (11:59.23) at last weekend's Tiffin University Carnival in Tiffin, Ohio.
Mary is getting adjusted to Division I training and will be a work in progress as she continues to train hard to meet the demands of the Big East (this season) and the Atlantic Coast Conference (next season), coach Alonzo Webb said.
The Panthers will compete in the Penn State Nationals Friday and Saturday in State College.

The Lowly Ditch Lily
You know this plant; it's everywhere. In backyard gardens and along roadsides. It's Hemerocallis fulva, also known as Orange Lily, Ditch Lily, Outhouse Lily (I'd love to know the backstory on that nickname), and less offensive - Tawny Daylily.
My mom was an incredible vegetable gardener, and grew some perennials too, but I remember my next door neighbor (hi, Glenn!) having a huge bed of Ditch Lilies that grew through the chain link fence that seperated our yards. I used to take ownership of any of the flowers that bloomed on my side of the fence. They were so captivating and exotic looking compared to the dandelion and clover flowers I routinely collected from the lawn. I wonder if most people have a memory of this ubiquitous plant.
Last week a fellow plant geek friend of mine told me she was looking for a few of these to transplant into her yard. I was kind of surprised that someone with extensive plant knowledge choose this plant over other, more unique ones. But she shared that she had memories of growing orange lilies when her three grown boys were just babies, and that triggered my own memories of the plant - hot, sunny summer afternoons spent daydreaming and making bouquets for my mom. And I immediately understood. I brought her about 15 of the plants from my own back garden. And in doing so, perpetuated a pass-along practice that has been going on in our country since as early as 1793.
Many think Hemerocallis fulva is native, but it was actually brought here from Europe, and from China before that. It does not reseed, so according to this very interesting article, "it's widespread distribution is the handiwork of gardeners." So, the next time you see these lilies growing in an unusual place, you'll know that someone intentionally planted them there!
What are your experiences with Hemerocallis fulva?

Bush Led Kerry in IEM
June 11, 2004 | Bloomberg NewsDemocratic presidential candidate John Kerry continued to lead George W. Bush in polls the week of June 11 as voters expressed concern about the president's handling of the Iraq war and the economy. But some investors are betting Bush will win in November. According to the IOWA ELECTRONIC MARKETS, as of June 11 investors were paying 53.2 cents for futures that pay $1 in November should Bush win the election. Kerry futures were quoted at 46.8 cents. Sponsored by the University of Iowa Henry B. Tippie College of Business, the market allows investors to buy and sell futures contracts based on the outcome of political and economic events, such as elections and Federal Reserve interest-rate changes.

As far as New York City kids go, Bibi Cornejo Borthwick, who is the daughter of the fashion designer Maria Cornejo and the artist and T photographer Mark Borthwick, and Roman Grandinetti, a D.J. and the founder of the creative agency CNNCTD+, are pretty well connected. But just how connected even they couldn’t be so sure until they reached out to 100 of their cultural heroes and, using a Playbutton as a platform, loaded their words of wisdom, favorite songs and even the occasional recipe onto the wearable MP3 devices. The artist Cindy Sherman, who claimed not to like public speaking, curated a playlist; the legendary art director George Lois read from his new book, “Damn Good Advice“; Pharrell Williams rapped philosophic on his personal otherness (his new record label is called I Am Other). Starting tonight, and for the next three weeks, 10 different MP3 buttons will be available to the listening public at the New Museum Store as part of CNNCTD+100. Additional buttons have been planted throughout the city at special Sound Graffiti stations. (Hint: the Jason Woodside mural on Kenmare Street between Bowery and Elizabeth has something to say for itself.) Cornejo Borthwick and Grandinetti’s plan is to take the project global, bringing the buttons — and their collective good will — to cities like Paris and Tokyo and adding new names to the roster along the way. “In New York City people are always so competitive,” Cornejo Borthwick observes. “The way to succeed is to collaborate.”

They say a picture can tell a thousand words. When dealing with historical pictures, the pictures not only become our mechanism for visualizing the past, but in some way, reliving the past. Being so close, as to actually see immortal images of people, places and things can free us to share a glimpse of time with those who went on before us.

The Gun Control Debate: Americans Generally Like The NRA
by YouGov Staff in Economist/YouGov Poll and Politics
Fri February 1, 8 a.m. PST
(Week of 1/26/2013) Despite majority support for stricter gun control laws in general, and overwhelming support for some specific measures, the National Rifle Association may have at least a narrow advantage in the gun debate: more Americans continue to have a favorable view of the organization than an unfavorable one. In the latest Economist/YouGov Poll, 44% have a favorable view of the NRA, while 37% are unfavorable.
Groups with a negative view of the NRA are stronger supporters of gun control measures: 63% of Democrats have an unfavorable opinion of the gun rights group, as do 56% of African-Americans. Northeasterners are less likely than those in other regions to be favorable. Just under six out of ten college graduates are negative. So are nearly half of moderates and those under 30 years old. People in the West — residents of states no further east than Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico — are evenly divided. A majority of independents and 7% of Republicans view the NRA favorably. By 51% to 36%, men have a positive view of the NRA; women are evenly divided.
Another difference is between those who own guns and those who don’t. Gun ownership is low in the urban Northeast, and among those under 30. Republicans and independents are more than twice as likely as Democrats to own guns. A third of men say they personally own a gun, while just 13% of women do. But an additional 22% of women live in a household where someone else is a gun owner.
By 68% to 24%, those who own a gun view the NRA favorably; those with no gun in their household are unfavorable, though by just a ten-point margin (34% to 44%). Adults in gun owning households are positive—even though they do not own a gun themselves.
Since the December killings of 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Conn., a majority of Americans have favored making gun control laws stricter. In this week’s poll, 52% are in favor of that. One in three wants no changes, and one in ten would loosen gun control laws.

I have to confess these paintings leave me feeling uncomfortable! The first painting reminds me of strange experiences I used to have playing chess......sometimes when I was feeling threatened by an opponent's superior play the chessboard began to distort in front of my eyes and I could no longer distinguish between the black and white squares!
Anyway thanks for broadening my horizons.
Wow. These are great. I liked the first and the third one very much. Thanks for sharing...:)
Bob: They are not to everyone's taste but at least you had an emotional reaction! Sounds like your chess game took place in Wonderland with magic mushrooms on the menu.
Mr Stupid: Glad you liked them.
Thanks for the laughs you provide over at your blog; I always enjoy your posts even if I don't comment!
Hmm, the first one makes me dizzy.
Parlancheq: I think it's meant to!
These paintings are quite large when you see them in a gallery and you sometimes need to hold on to something to avoid falling over.
Hi bazza,
Struggling to leave a comment as I'm getting these wavy lines in front of my eyes. Weird.
Thanks for posting Bridget's pictures. I guess.
All the best, bazza. I'm going for a lie down in a darkened room...
The first one is a real bona fide optical illusion, for sure. Makes my sight a little jittery. The second, eh, didn't do much for me. The third, however, does make me feel drunk or bouncing gently with the waves in water. Can't decide.
Gary: It's OK to say if you don't like them or can't see the point; lots of people don't. Personally I find them fascinating. Bridget Riley is highly respected in the modern art world. I'm sure a lie down will do you good!
Kelly: I think the artist would be pleased that you had any kind of reaction! Thanks for commenting (even reluctantly!)
Hi bazza,
I thought the paintings were interesting. I sensed a bit of optical illusion which was actually okay.
I neither like them or dislike them. So, that makes me neutral. Heck, at this rate, I should run for politics. After my lie down lol
Gary: Actually, I rather enjoy pushing the boundaries a bit. So if I show something people haven't seen before I get a buzz; it doesn't matter too much which way you go so I am grateful for your honest reaction. You may find that now you know about Bridget Riley you might notice her influence all around. She is considered to be very influential since the sixties.
They do seem to move and I actually had to look away a time or two...almost like being on an artistic roller coaster ride.
Lovely the same.
Mimi: Glad you like them, Mimi. But you were dizzy to start with!
Like Mimi I saw movement in these pieces, especially when looking away... and like Parlancheq the first one made me dizzy... From all of the reactions in the comments, it would be advised not to mix Belgian beer with a study of these paintings :)
Joanne: You are right, I didn't realise at first about the juxtaposition of these last posts. Maybe some sub-conscious event made me link the two!
I, of course, a newcomer to this blog, but the author does not agree

Belladonna Took
Belladonna Baggins (née Took) (Third Age 2852 - 2934, died aged 82) was the mother of Bilbo Baggins.
History
Belladonna was one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took.[1] She had eight older brothers (and one younger), and was the eldest of the three daughters.[2] Belladonna married Bungo Baggins, who built a spacious hole for her (partly with her money).[1] It became the residence of the Baggins Family, and in Third Age 2890, her son and only child Bilbo was born. She died in Third Age 2934,[2] eight years after her husband.[3]
Etymology
belladonna is the name of a poisonous plant,[4] fitting in with the Hobbit-habit of naming girls after flowers.[5]
The word is understood as an Italian name, a rarity among Hobbits (though her sisters Donnamira and Mirabella share this peculiarity) and translates as "beautiful lady" although it derives from Latin bladone "nightshade".
Inspiration
In her first appearance in the fiction, Belladonna - which has stayed unchanged from the earliest survived sketch of the story[6] - is described as "one of three remarkable daughters of the Old Took". Humphrey Carpenter, in his attempt to draw an analogy between Bilbo and Tolkien, noted that Tolkien's mother, Mabel Suffield, was one of three remarkable daughters of John Suffield, who lived to be nearly a hundred.[7]
Portrayal in Adaptations
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
- A portrait of Belladonna Baggins hangs in Bag End. It is based on Fran Walsh's appearance. A portrait of Bungo next to it is based on a beardless Peter Jackson.[8]
2003: Sierra's The Hobbit:
- A portrait of Belladonna, Bungo and a young Bilbo hangs at Bag End. As he looks at it, Bilbo exclaims "A Hobbit couldn't ask for finer parents".[9]

>>,
And so this moment, which would have been the last had not this next one just arrived, and then this one, "beginning again and again" as Stein said. I didn't get to leave this 'note on things' yesterday, which seems again (in these parallel universes of ours) to 'connect' --.
Both the Johnson and Wittgenstein pieces, which I’m reading as a single Beyond The Pale publication, affected me very directly and strongly. In pure cliché terms (for which I apologize), I immediately felt them as light as air (in terms of the form and clarity of expression) and heavy as lead (in terms of their moral and intellectual import).
……..” is essentially my home address.
The force of “consideration upon the careless” has both darkened my view of human character (the effects of the current economic recession on the behavior of many people I encounter reminds me constantly of what you see on the Discovery Channel in terms of the savagery, but with none of the actual survival issues and none of the beauty) and provided occasional, unexpected happy surprises, thank heaven. (Friends, including BTP, family, the great outdoors, the great indoors, the surprising kindness of strangers.)
The weirdest thing to me about yesterday’s Goldman Sachs hearings (apart from seeing the father of a former classmate of my daughter’s testify) was the repeated use of the phrase “get closer to home”. I’m not a financier, but I think they were referring to the even-value position of the X axis set at 0, a flat-line. It clearly wasn’t meant to sound sinister, but I found it untoward. I mean home is where the heart is, where home plate is, not a flat-line. way.
Why would the light of the past and the light of the future intersect at a focal point--the eye of the observer? But we don't "see" time--it's an illusion. Nor can we "see" things in the past or the future. Except, perhaps, in the astronomical sense--where light traveling from distant galaxies reaches us millions of years after it was "sent" -- and, hence, we can only see the universe "as it was" before we--or anything else in our Solar System--even existed. It's a weird notion. The whole distant universe may have changed, but we will never know, since we, and all of our eventual descendants--will be long gone by that time.
Blip.
The present is all we have.
It’s funny, but I was just taking virtual pen to virtual paper and considering Curtis Faville’s observation when I saw Lucy In The Sky’s comment (which I was preparing, in advance of seeing it, to echo, which I guess isn’t temporally possible), and thinking: “Now if it is not the causal connections which we are concerned with, then the activities of the mind lie open before us.”
Logically/poetically, the light/cone illustration makes sense to me.
Curtis F.,
That blip point of the visualized two dimensional intersection, postulated for the convenience of the schematic mind, seemed to me an example of the sort of reduction of dimension of the experience of duration which Wittgenstein would have regarded as (in the immortal paraphrase of the philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt) "bullshit".".)
The other, no doubt obvious intended irony in the post involved the lower image of the formidable Devourer Goddess Kali, who "represents" Time, having her visual field (which according to Wittgenstein has, like our lives, no limits) -- or shall I say our visual field, including her now as merely one panel in a diptych -- extended beyond the designed limits.
Oh, well.
Peggy, welcome!
Curtis R.,
Know what you mean about that light/heavy clarity. The diptych is complicated for me (happily so, actually) by the fact each panel possesses certain of the motifs of the other.
The connection for me is that these are sentences, that is those of both writers, so constructed as to make the experience of them, for the mind, no less interesting, no less worth wanting to be in the middle of, for a moment, than the larger experience of a world.
When Wittgenstein with apparent serene assurance asserts we have left causality behind and now stand at the brink of an activity of the mind which is open and has no limits, I hear a Germanic poetry which veils its weight within a wonderful lightness.
Reading him sometimes a hear in my inner ear an odd tune, I imagine a brilliant schoolboy whistling the austere lyric of a perfectly constructed lieder as he proceeds through the dark woods of the Black Forest to the home of the local postman who was once his student, to ask forgiveness.
"(Not by the way to criticize the diagram, I found it strangely poetic, and a bit humorous as well.. .)"
Should probably add in explanation, lest the "humorous" in regard to the diagram seem a COMPLETE nonsequitur, that I can't keep from imagining the Future Light Cone and the Past Light Cone as matching protective devices designed to keep similarly afflicted twin dogs from overmuch obsessive worrying of bothersome, perhaps phantom itches..
And by the way, as to that OTHER nonsequitur: I seem to recall that I am not imagining things, LW actually did make that trek after absolution to which I vaguely allude, perhaps not with a lied on his lips nor in his heart -- as he was then dying, and at the end of a terminal quest to seek forgiveness from everyone he thought he had ever wronged, no matter how infinitesim
Imagine what this aspect must have looked like before the white man came. Pale yellow grassland punctuated with scrub oak, and higher up, stands of 200 year redwood. Herds of deer, foxes, ground-hogs, snakes. Flocks of birds filled the tidelands. The bay teeming with fish.."

After the moon goes down, the nearness of the night, fair
And dark in its standing against the remaining trees,
Comes off as not an embellishment
But a facsimile. Where have I seen this evening before.
Past is past. It is no longer the small town nineteen forties.
But living in the moment is postponed by
This uncanny sense of repetition.
For example, at the filling station
On the corner outside the theatre,
Beneath violet neon, near green garbage cans
And racks of bright red cans of motor oil, and rows of whitewalls
Stacked for sale, a young man in blue overalls pumps
Gas, over and over, in my mental reproduction of this scene,
Remembered from a foggy night on Pico, Santa Monica,
1951. Sometimes images will never leave your mind.
It's as though you were merely the carrier pigeon
For messages of unknown origin, to be delivered over and over.
As when, after a long day of construction
And assembly, the factory worker and the apprentice escort,
Having put workaday cares aside for a rare night out
At the movies, sitting rapt through the double feature,
Shyly holding hands, turn to one another at last
And sigh, and one whispers to the other,
In a tone of concession gentler than the soft summer night wind,
This is where we came in.

James Schuyler, "Salute", of course. He beings that poem with something I've always found troubling:
Past is past, and if one
remembers what one meant
to do and never did, is
not to have thought to do
enough?
My reaction's always been NO. To have thought to do and not done is called regret, in my book, and, at this point in my life, my regrets are what I find most heartbreaking.
I don't feel any "no" when I read your poem. This is beautiful.
Yes.
And yes.
Double feature thankyous.
A strong sense of the eternal, told within a modern span. Time transforms itself around me, making it harder to believe that all moments do not exist at once. I found so much to connect with in this piece. I agree that "no" is not a component, more a dreamy waltz that plays forever. Beautiful, very.
Heartbreaking. Heartbroken.
Tom,
Yes, "Past is past," and yet/also "This uncanny sense of repetition." Meanwhile, "This is where we came in." --

I don't know if there are still double features. My early moviegoing experiences were entirely double feature experiences. There were several theatres in my immediate urban neighborhood. You could watch the double feature as many times as you wished, over and over. Eternal recurrence seemed a plausible way of life in the universe.
"Eternal recurrence seemed a plausible way of life in the universe." That was also my experience. When I was growing up, my mother parked me in the local movie theater for long periods of double feature watching, seeing the movies over and over, as you say. I couldn't have been happier and, upon reflection, may never have been happier. I think double features are now only offered by art/repertory houses, which isn't the same thing at all.
just beautiful!
"Sometimes images will never leave your mind.

*sigh*
Curtis, hb,
Good to have your thoughts always.
The top picture here reminded me of early moviegoing experiences. The original intention of its making and propagating was obviously patriotic. However the feeling it evokes, now, has more to do with personal and cultural memories.
Most commonly I work from words to images, but in this case I began with the images; and from the associations produced by the images the words then came.
The utter immediacy of the voice of this poem is superb and effortlessly exacting.
But a facsimile.
is an absolute genius of a work.
Not a movie/cinema-goer myself, but been a witness to the double features plenty o' times in the daily events of life. How certain events keep coming, again. Unsorted is just another way of being sorted. It requires much less an effort.
Lovely poem !
"Unsorted is just another way of being sorted."
Inscribe that on my ash thermos, please.
Hahaha!
DO it YOURSELF.
Well atleast you though about it.
Poets are useless.

Choosing Sides Part 1: Using Luminosity Masks to Fix Halos
Lumin_6<<_7<<
Now invert the white Reveal All mask on the adjustment layer to make it black instead of white (Windows: Ctrl+I / Mac: Command+I). It is now a Conceal All mask as shown in the layer stack below. The normal haloed image returns.
_9<<_10<<.
In a previous post I described how luminosity painting is one of my favorite techniques for balancing the light in an image. The technique can be effectively used to burn or dodge specific parts of an image while maintaining tonal contrast in the areas being painted. In this post I’ll expand on the technique a little more and show some variations in the procedure that can be useful.
Unlike black and white images where a full tonal range from delicate whites to detailed shadows is often desirable, color images usually look better with the highlights retaining some good color instead of going to light or pure white. In fact, I’ve developed a preference for a left-shifted histogram for color images–no whites at all and mostly composed of mid-tones and quarter tones as seen in the histogram below.
Even though there may not be many of them in an image, getting the brightest values correct is still important. This is difficult to do sometimes because simply darkening white values yields gray, which really has no color either, and doesn’t contribute to the richness that may be desired. A good place to start to achieve the proper light tones is with RAW conversion, making sure there are no clipped highlights and that the light tones are already left-shifted and retaining color. This allows them to be further developed to the proper brightness and contrast in Photoshop.
The image below is one that I consider nearly finished. Color, brightness, contrast, and saturation had been addressed during processing, and on-screen it seemed nearly as good as I could make it. I usually let the print help make the final call as to when an image is actually finished, and the light values in this image looked a little weak in the print. They had too much tonal whiteness and not enough color richness. The rollover of the image (it may take a few seconds to load) shows the final version after the light tone had been further addressed. These tones have been darkened in the rollover and have richer color, but the contrast in these light values has been retained to bring out the texture.
There are, of course, many ways luminosity masks could be used to make this adjustment. What I’ll illustrate here is a way to do it with a combination of techniques, each of which may also be useful in other situations.
INVERTED MASKS
The first thing that will be done is to luminosity paint through an inverted luminosity mask. I’ve previously written that these inverted masks aren’t too useful. They tend to include a lot of tones and don’t isolate specific tones as a result. However, there is a dictum with luminosity masks that point to a way in which inverted masks might be useful:
To increase contrast in an image when luminosity painting, paint white through a Lights-series mask or paint black through a Darks-series mask.
Because of the way luminosity masks are generated, each series concentrates the selection progressively towards one end of the tonal spectrum. The Lights-series masks, for example, have fewer and fewer tones as the masks progress from Lights to Light Lights to Bright Lights and finally to Super Lights. The tones that do remain in the progression are the whitest and lightest with pure white being selected in every mask. Luminosity painting through a Lights-series mask, therefore, deposits more paint on the less-masked light tones than on the relatively more-masked darker tones. So painting with white means that the light tones get more paint and get lighter faster than the darker tones, which receive less paint. The end result being increased contrast in the area being painted. The opposite happens when painting with black through a Lights-series mask—the less-masked light tones receive more black paint and darken faster than the more-masked darker tones, which in turn decreases contrast in the area being painted.
Any inverted mask switches to the opposite series. An inverted Light Lights mask, for example, is effectively a Darks-series mask. Even though the inverted mask doesn’t have a name, it’s character is decidedly that of a Darks-series mask, namely that the parts of the image that show in the mask are a gray-scale negative of the original image with the darkest tones being 100% pure white in the mask. This is demonstrated in the Light Lights mask for the above image which is shown below. The rollover shows the Darks-series inverse.
So according to the dictum, painting black through the inverted Lights Lights selection, which becomes a Darks-series selection, should darken and increase contrast in the areas that receive paint. That’s what was done in this case. The process is as follows:
- Create the Burn/Dodge layer (new layer > fill with 50% gray > set blending mode to “Soft Light”)
- Create a Light Lights selection (and save a copy as a mask on the Channels panel).
- Invert the selection.
- Hide the marching ants.
- Make sure the foreground color is set to black.
- Paint black onto the Burn/Dodge layer through the inverted Light Lights selection (a 33% opacity soft brush was used)
- Deselect the hidden selection when done.
After luminosity painting through the inverted Light Lights mask, the Burn/Dodge layer looked like the image below. The areas darker than 50% gray cause darkening in the image.
The resultant image is shown below. The too-light areas have been made darker and painting through a luminosity mask has blended the darkening into the rest of the image, but it’s overdone. There is now a blackness in some of the areas that were painted as well as some dark haloing along the center ridge. This is because the broad, inverted selection allowed the paint to be applied in a very imprecise manner. Too much black paint reached the darker pixels in the image because they are substantially revealed by the inverted selection. While this is expected, the image has taken on a color “gloppiness” as a result. For reference, the rollover is the original image.
It may be hard to notice, but within this heavy-handed paint job the desired darkening of the light tones has been achieved along with a slight boost in their overall contrast. Black paint applied through a Darks-series mask (the inverted Light Lights in this case) insures this. Now it’s just a matter of fine-tuning the painting to separate the properly-painted pixels from the poorly-painted ones.
MASKING LUMINOSITY PAINTING
A luminosity layer mask on the luminosity-painted Burn/Dodge layer is the way to reveal the good parts of this bad paint job. Interestingly, the Light Lights mask, the one that was inverted for luminosity painting, can now serve as the correct mask to reveal the desired darkening in the pixels that were originally too light. While simply adding the Light Lights mask as a layer mask does a pretty good job, I prefer to actually paint the mask through the Light Lights selection so as to create a more precise reveal and to augment it with multiple brush strokes in specific areas. The procedure is as follows.
- Create a Hide All layer mask on the Burn/Dodge layer (a “black” layer mask).
- Create a Light Lights selection. (NOTE: It’s best to use the original Light Lights mask from the unpainted image instead of creating a new one from the now gloppy image. The original Light Lights mask can be stored on the Channels panel when it’s created and reselected at this point.)
- Hide the marching ants.
- Make sure that the mask is selected for painting and that white is the foreground color.
- Paint white onto the layer mask (100% opacity, soft brush) in the areas where the darkening effect of the luminosity painting needs to be revealed.
- Deselect the hidden selection when done.
Imprecision in painting this time has a much less deleterious effect on the image. The Light Lights selection is much narrower than its tonal inverse. As such, it’s harder to paint outside the lines because the selection is more confining as to where paint gets applied. Some care needs to be taken in smaller confined areas or where multiple brush strokes are used, but overall a few wide strokes of the brush creates the painted mask that reveals the darkening in just those areas where it’s needed. The remaining dark areas of the painted mask effectively conceal the gloppiness of the original paint job. Below is the painted mask that was created. The whitest areas are where multiple brush strokes were applied to create greater reveal of the luminosity painting.
The image that results after painting the layer mask for the Burn/Dodge layer is shown below. The rollover is the unmasked layer with the gloppy luminosity painting that was visible without the layer mask.
The painted mask effectively selected the right pixels to reveal in order to achieve the desired darkening effect in the light tones of the image. This is a good example of how luminosity mask selections, when employed in painting, can correctly select tones and seamlessly blend the desired effect into the rest of the image. What’s most remarkable in this case is that even after the grossly overdone luminosity painting through the inverted mask, painting a layer mask through the Light Lights selection was still able to reveal just the right amount of tonal adjustment for each pixel that received paint and almost effortlessly facilitated the desired adjustment to the image.
The blue highlighted layer below shows how this Burn/Dodge luminosity painting layer with its painted layer mask looked in Photoshop’s Layers panel when the procedure was complete.
BLURRING THE MASK
While I don’t often feel it necessary to blur luminosity masks, this is one time that it helped. Light tones tend to blend together visually. Blurring the mask provides a bit of increased sharpness, which causes what texture there is in the light tones to become a bit more visually separated. When I apply blur to luminosity masks, it’s usually a 21-pixel Gaussian blur. That amount was chosen to “correlate” with my 21-megapixel camera, but I’m not really sure if there is any correlation at all. For whatever reason, the 21-pixel Gaussian blur seems to provide a good result when used to blur a luminosity mask. The blurred mask is shown below.
Below is the final image after the blur was applied to the layer mask. The rollover is the image with the unblurred layer mask. The difference may be hard to see in this size image, but it has a nice effect on a larger jpeg and the actual print.
In summary, three steps were used to make this adjustment:
- Paint through an inverted luminosity mask to maintain/enhance contrast.
- Create a painted layer mask by painting through a luminosity mask selection to reveal the luminosity painting to the appropriate degree in the appropriate pixels.
- Blur the layer mask if it helps to improve textures/contrast.

Listening to the Light – Examples in Image Development – Part 2
The last post discussed concepts about listening to the light in an image—working to understand what’s not quite right and then finding a way to correct it. It’s an interactive and iterative process with each step building on what has been done previously. The process may require going back to adjust previous adjustment layers, printing the image and looking at it in different light to see things that the on-screen image might not reveal, and a willingness to experiment to find the best way to make a particular adjustment.
An important part of this process, I think, is finding and nurturing a relationship with the image and its light. While the Layers panel may have 10 to 20 different layers to complete the development process, only a few of them usually make significant changes in how the image looks. These “layers of significance” make the more dramatic changes to the image and set the overall tone and direction that development takes. These are the “finding the relationship” layers—the big steps. They’re the ones that spark interest in pushing ahead, rev up the imagination, and make one start to feel a bit giddy about the possibilities the light may hold in this image. These layers tend to create a degree of infatuation. There is increasing desire to be with this image and it’s light to see what might happen.
The other layers—the majority of layers in the layer stack—make smaller, less dramatic changes. These are the “nurturing” layers. They keep the relationship going, sometimes at a very deep level. When there’s no big changes happening during the development process, it’s these small steps that build on the themes first realized in the big steps. This is often a slower process, and it takes careful listening to figure out what the image wants. But as the whispers become reality, there is a certain closeness and intimacy that develops between the photographer and the image. The light will only speak to the photographer who took the picture at this point, and the photographer is the only one who can understand what the light is saying.
This post is going to take a look at the big steps in the development of an image. These are easier to see in mouse rollovers, so they lend themselves better to instructional purposes. Unlike the last post that showed the incremental changes in finishing an image, the rollovers here should be more obvious. A good place to start is to take a look at the final image, which is shown below. This is another sandstone abstract. The natural color in the rock, the warm light reflected from a nearby cliff face, and the blue light from an open sky combined to produce an interesting mix of colors. I saw the color, lines, and texture when I was taking the picture and felt like I would enjoy developing them out in Photoshop; however, I didn’t visualize this as the final image. The final image is the result of an ongoing dialog with the light as the image developed and the relationship that ensued. I felt there were three “big steps” that moved this image along, and I’ll go over each of them and how they were accomplished. First, however, rollover this image with the mouse. It shows how the image would look with the visibility of the three “big-step” layers turned off. (NOTE: It may take a few seconds for the second image to load.)
Healing/Cloning
The first big step that was important for this image was healing and cloning. My original thought was to keep this minimal since immediately after converting the RAW file everything seemed to look OK and work reasonably well together. About halfway through development, however, this changed. Richer colors and more pronounced contrast were starting to come out, and as a result, some of the lighter blue patches, especially in the foreground, were starting to look out of place in both brightness and color. So I cloned them out. There are different “ethics” with regard to how much cloning one should or should not do to an image. There seems to be more leeway given in nature photography to cloning out rather than cloning in. Removing twigs, leaves, and other “spots” seems acceptable, but cloning in birds, clouds, and animals is not. Personally, my ethics are pretty liberal on this subject. What the picture and the photographer do in the privacy of the computer is their business, not everyone else’s. In other words, it’s a personal decision. I also tend to be somewhat liberal when it comes to using Photoshop’s healing and cloning tools in my images when I feel it works to remove elements that cause visual distraction. If it’s done well and enhances the image, I think it’s a credit to the photographer and their skill. Photoshop’s healing brush, which was used here, generally produces good results, though it does require working on a magnified image to insure perfect blending. The image below is again the final image. The rollover shows how the image looks with the Heal/Clone layer turned off in which the blue areas distract the eye slightly from moving smoothly through the scene from lower right to upper left.
Below is the Heal/Clone layer that produced this effect. The healed ares show up well against the checkered background. Looking closely at this layer shows a bit of a dark smudge in the lower left corner. This isn’t healing/cloning; it’s luminosity painting. I had the wrong layer selected and accidentally added a thin layer of black paint to the Heal/Clone layer. However, I liked the effect it had on the image and simply left it in. The effect can easily be seen in the rollover above as a bit of darkening in this area.
Make-It-Glow
Make-It-Glow is a technique available in my complete set of tutorials and actions. I actually don’t use it all that often, but when it works, it can make a big difference in how an image looks. It simultaneously increases contrast and saturation in a smooth manner across the entire image. It essentially imparts a glow to the image that looks pretty natural. A low-contrast, low-saturation image that has lots of texture is a good place to try it. Images that have large areas the same color or significant color saturation tend to look garish with this technique, so it needs to be used judiciously. Since it makes a pretty dramatic change, lowering the opacity of the layer it’s on can help decrease the effect if it goes too far. Also, a vibrance mask on the layer can help restrict the effect to less-saturated areas of the image. In this image, it was applied soon after RAW conversion and before development had brought out the colors and contrast. As such, it worked well to increase the overall saturation without the need to lower the layer’s opacity or mask the effect. Again, the final image is below. The rollover is how it looks with the Make-It-Glow layer turned off.
Luminosity Painting
Luminosity painting once again had a significant impact on this image, but it was used in a decidedly different manner than in the last post. In the image in the previous post, most of the burning and dodging were done through a Basic Mid-tones mask to even out the brightness across the image. This resulted in decreased general contrast, which was restored in the next step. For this image I was more concerned about the lack of local contrast that I was seeing in the image and wanted to paint in more contrast while at the same time evening out the light across the image. To increase contrast with luminosity painting, there is an easy rule to remember: LIGHT through LIGHTS, DARK through DARKS. What this means is that to increase contrast when luminosity painting, paint a LIGHT color through a LIGHTS-series masks or paint a DARK color through a DARKS-series mask. For luminosity painting, LIGHT color paint = white, and DARK color paint = black.
So here’s a summary of my goals and how I’ll accomplish them:
- 1st Goal: Darken and increase contrast in areas that are too light.
Technique: Paint black through a Darks-series selection (Expanded Darks, Darks, Dark Darks, Shadow Darks, or Super Darks).
- 2nd Goal: Lighten and increase contrast in areas that are too dark.
Technique: Paint white through a Lights-series selection (Expanded Lights, Lights, Light Lights, Bright Lights, or Super Lights).
While it’s necessary to follow the “LIGHT through LIGHTS, DARKS through DARKS” rule in order to to increase local contrast while balancing overall light, it’s also possible to do it in a more nuanced way that offers greater control. Instead of using the “straight” Darks- and Lights-series selections to paint through, subtracting one mask from another creates a subtracted selection that selects image tones nearer the mid-tones. So, for example, paint won’t be applied to the full range of tones in a Darks selection. Instead, just the Dark tones near the mid-tones are selected. For this image the “DARKS” selection that was painted through was actually the Darks minus the Shadow Darks. This selection contains the image’s dark tones, but the darkest tones are subtracted off making the selected tones the darker mid-tones of the image.
Black paint is going to be applied through this selection to the Burn/Dodge layer to darken the too-light areas of the image, which generally contain light tones. As such, it’s necessary to be a bit careful in how the paint is applied. The subtracted selection still favors dark tones, so dark tones can easily get more paint than light tones when black paint is applied through the selection. So it’s important to choose the right size brush that doesn’t spread the paint too far outside the intended areas to be darkened and to control the brush strokes so they predominantly hit in the light areas that need to be darkened. Sometimes a slightly harder brush (30-50% hardness) can be useful in not straying into the dark areas too much.
You might be thinking that this approach sort of goes against the main advantage of luminosity painting, which is that errant brush strokes are of little consequence since the selection is controlling which pixels receive paint. This is a consideration, of course, but also keep in mind that painting is occurring through a luminosity selection, so it will still blend into the image. It’s just a matter of making sure that most of the paint gets stroked onto the areas that need to be changed. Additionally, the selected tones that receive paint are near image’s mid-tones; the darkest tones in the image are subtracted off and don’t receive much paint.
Again, the selection being painted through here is Darks minus the Shadow Darks. The mask of this subtracted selection is shown below.
The light areas are darker in this mask but aren’t completely black. This means they will still receive paint if they are stroked with a brush of sufficient opacity. Because the mask reveals dark tones more than light tones, darker pixels get darker faster when black paint is applied through the selection to the Burn/Dodge layer. So if the light tones are painted black through this selection, all the light tones get a bit darker, but the darker light tones get darker faster than the lighter light tones. This increases contrast in the light tones, and is exactly what is expected from the “DARK through DARKS” rule, and what is desired in this image.
Lightening the dark tones to increase contrast works the same way except this time the selection being painted though needs to come from the Lights-series of mask. A subtracted selection is once again desirable and the Lights minus Light Lights works well for this purpose. It selects the lighter mid-tones in the image and subtracts off the image’s lightest tones. It’s a pretty narrow selection and it’s mask shows a predominance of dark gray tones as shown below.
When loaded as a selection, there are no pixels more than 50% select, so no marching ants appear. Still it’s the right selection for the job and will be effective in lightening the dark tones while increasing their contrast. However, it’s again necessary when painting to be a careful to brush primarily the dark areas of the image that need adjustment and not stray too much into the light areas. With a little care, the LIGHT paint through the LIGHTS-series of masks lightens and increases the contrast of dark tones in the image.
The image below shows the painted Burn/Dodge layer for this image. White paint lightens and black paint darkens the underlying image and it’s possible to combine both these things on one layer by painting through the appropriate selections as described above. The rollover shows the image before painting in order to see how white paint was applied to the dark areas of the image and black paint to the light areas in order facilitate the appropriate burning and dodging.
The more even light across the image and the good maintenance of local contrast that resulted from luminosity painting can seen below. Again, this is the final image and the rollover is the image with the Burn/Dodge layer turned off.
A quick summary of this procedure might be useful, so here are the steps
- Create the Burn/Dodge layer.
- Create a Darks minus Shadow Darks selection and hide the ants.
- Apply black paint to the Burn/Dodge Layer through this selection to areas of the image that are too light, being careful to adjust brush size and hardness to only paint in the light areas as much as possible.
- Create a Lights minus Light Lights selection, clicking OK when the warning box comes up that no pixels are more than 50% selected.
- Apply white paint to the Burn/Dodge Layer through this selection to areas of the image that are too dark, being careful to adjust brush size and hardness to paint mainly in the dark areas where increased brightness is desired.
I like this technique enough that I recommended it to Alban Fenle when I saw one of his images. I requested to use the image in this post as it worked well to demonstrate this luminosity painting technique and he agreed. His image is more “realistic” than my sandstone picture and is shown below. The only adjustment I added to this image was luminosity painting on a Burn/Dodge layer as described above. The too-light areas of the image were painted with black paint through a Darks minus Shadow Darks selection, and the too-dark areas were painted white through a Lights minus Light Lights selection. The paint was somewhat carefully applied with a 30% hard brush to makes sure the right pixels received paint. This evened out the light across the image and maintained good contrast in the areas being painted. The end result, I think, is richer colors with stronger detail in both the highlight and shadow areas. The rollover shows the image after luminosity painting using this technique.
The Burn/Dodge layer that resulted from painting is shown below. The rollover is the original image so that it’s easier to see which light and dark areas received paint.
Alban’s version after applying this technique is posted on his Google+ page. It’s different from what I did, and that’s one of the nice things about luminosity painting—it’s a very personal way to interact with the image; no two photographers can do it the same. There are many interpretations of an image, and the photographer and the image will together decide what works best.
Listening to the Light – Examples in Image Development
One of the hardest things about developing an image in Photoshop is figuring out what changes to apply to improve it. This is an acquired skill, I think, that, like composing an image with the camera, improves with practice. Sometimes I know exactly what I need to do in Photoshop, but I also spend a lot of time going back and forth on different possibilities, experimenting with alternate techniques, and generally exploring options before settling on a particular adjustment. Even then, I may go back and readjust an adjustment layer depending on what happens with subsequent layers.
Image development is a dynamic process, not a one-way street. I receive questions asking which technique to use in developing an image and when to use it, and the answer is always the same: It depends on what the image needs. Responding to the image often means that a standard “workflow” probably isn’t going to work. It’s really the image dictating what needs to be done, not the photographer or some repeatable steps. It’s necessary to respond to the light in the image in the same way you respond to the light in the field. Don’t try to control it. Instead, work with it, listen to it, and let it determine the direction of development.
There’s a corollary to this concept of listening to the light that is very important. Once you do figure out what the image needs, you have to have the right tool or technique to address the issue. As such, I thought it might be instructive to occasionally write a post on how I think about what an image needs at different points in its development and discuss my approach to solving the “problems” that I perceive. In other words, what I heard when I listened to the light, and how I responded to what it was saying. The goal being not to go over every layer in the development of a particular image, but rather to look at a few of them and attempt to discuss the collaboration that was occurring between the image and me at that time. I’ll say up front that it’s not always easy to describe exactly what I was thinking. Sometimes it’s just intuition and sometimes just a fortunate experiment that helps to move image development forward. However, I also think that instances like this maybe reflect our deeper understanding of the light and that we just don’t always have the vocabulary to communicate these feelings.
The image below is one that is partially developed. It shows a sandstone detail that I recently photographed in twilight shortly after sunset. I know abstract images can be confusing, so just to get past the perceptional difficulties here, the camera is pointing downward to capture the layers of texture and color as they recede from the camera. Four Photoshop layers were added after this point in development. I’ll go over them one by one explaining what was going on and my reasons for adding the layers.
The first layer added was a luminosity painting layer, which involves dodging and burning through luminosity mask selections to lighten or darken specific parts and specific tones in the image. It’s described in detail in this tutorial. My goal in luminosity painting is generally to create an evenness of light so that the colors and textures assume a large role when viewing the image. This often involves lessening some of the natural shadows and highlights in the scene that might draw the eye unnaturally in the print. Dodging (lightening) with luminosity painting can sometimes remove excess saturation in dark areas and can add texture in light areas. Burning (darkening) can improve color richness to areas that look washed out and can remove distracting highlights that draw the viewer’s eye.
I usually start the process by painting through a Basic Mid-tones selection since it can be used to both lighten and darken the image, but I also use other selections or combinations of selections from masks of both the Darks-series and Lights-series depending on what I want to accomplish. Once the even light starts to come out in the image, the uneven places seem to stand out a bit more. In this way, luminosity painting sort of becomes self-directing. It’s just a matter of looking at the image and seeing and addressing the unbalanced light and then painting through an appropriate luminosity selection to correct it. I usually have all the Darks- and Lights-series of mask sitting on my Channels panel, as well as a Basic Mid-tones mask, so I can quickly grab what works best. Below is the luminosity painted Burn/Dodge layer for this image. The mouse rollover shows how the image looked before luminosity painting to provide a better idea of where paint was applied to even out the light. (Note: For all the the rollover images, it might take a short time to load the second image, but continue to hover the mouse over the image until it appears. Once it does, you should be able to move the mouse quickly back and forth over the edge of the image to see the change.)
Blacker areas on the luminosity painting layer darken the image, whiter areas lighten it, and 50% gray areas are unchanged. The luminosity selection being painted through determines which pixels receive paint and how much. The luminosity painting layer is generally one of the most dynamic in the layer stack. I continually return to it as subsequent layers shift the light, and apply additional paint, black or white, to bring back the evenness. Below is how the image looked after luminosity painting. The rollover shows the image before the luminosity painting layer was added so you can readily see the difference between before and after.
Once I had the light somewhat balanced with luminosity painting, the next thing I noticed was the lack of saturation in the colors and an overall flatness to the image. While luminosity painting can be used effectively to increase local contrast, using the technique to even out the tones across the entire image can result in a loss of general contrast. The benefit of balancing out the light almost always outweighs the risk of increased flatness though, since general contrast can be easily improved. Because the image was both lacking in general contrast and saturation, the most logical choice for addressing both issues is an S-curve on a Curves adjustment layer. One concern I had with this, however, was the fact that my histogram was looking pretty good at this point. An unmasked S-curve could cause loss of shadow detail as the dark tones got too dark, and the lighter tones might also start looking too light. I certainly didn’t want to clip any shadows in this image taken in soft light, and I generally try to avoid strong whites. S-curves also can really punch up the saturation, sometimes out of proportion to the desired contrast change. A mid-tones luminosity mask (Basic Mid-tones is always a good one to try) would be useful in this case for confining the adjustment to just the mid-tones in order to keep the dark and light sides of the histogram unchanged and for providing a more gentle increase in saturation. The Basic Mid-tones masks for this image is shown below.
This mask is always a bit hard to “read” in that it’s overall grayness is confusing. Essentially what a Basic Mid-tones mask reveals is the image’s mid-tones. Both the light and dark colors are darker (concealed by the mask from being adjusted) and mid-tone values are lighter (revealing the adjustment). The lack of pure black and pure white in the mask makes it seem like it would be ineffective at concealing or revealing anything in a meaningful way, but it actually does a very good job of targeting adjustments to just the image’s mid-tones, as designed, sparing the dark and light colors from being overly adjusted. The histogram below demonstrates this. The S-curve adjustment that was applied on the masked adjustment layer is shown in the figure below.
Like luminosity painting, an S-curve adjustment through a Basic Mid-tones mask seems to find its way into all my images since it’s a really good way to adjust overall contrast without messing up the histogram. If the saturation looks right before the adjustment, I change the layer’s blending mode to Luminosity to avoid adding saturation to the image, but generally the boost in saturation, especially with a small adjustment like this one, looks right and improves the image.
Below is the histogram before the curves adjustment was applied. The rollover is the histogram after the Curves adjustment through the Basic Mid-tones mask. Notice how the two ends of the histogram remain fixed. The improved overall contrast comes entirely from expanding the tonal range in the mid-tones.
Below is how the image looked after the addition of the Curves adjustment layer with the Basic Mid-tones mask. The rollover shows the image before this adjustment layer was added.
At this point I thought the on-screen version of the image was looking OK. I really didn’t see anything else that bothered me all that much. Whenever I reach this point of satisfaction, though, I make a print, and without fail, the problems I couldn’t see on my monitor are now quite obvious. I think this is because the transmitted light of the monitor makes almost everything look better. Pictures generally look better on-screen than on paper. So in this regard, viewing a print in reflected light encourages criticism, and it’s a useful tool, I believe, in helping to understand where the light in the print wants to go. The print in this case indicated a couple of problem areas, and the last two layers for this image are a direct result of viewing a hard-copy version of the image.
The most obvious problem was the blue color cast in some of the white rocks. This is completely natural given the light conditions at exposure—a clear sky with post-sunset glow in the west. However, in the print it seemed like the blue contrasted too much with the warmer elements in the scene. The image had become decidedly warmer as it developed, and these cool whites now felt a bit out of place. A warming filter would take care of this, but it wasn’t needed for the entire image and not even in all the white areas. Just the blue-colored whites need to be warmed. This is a situation where a painted mask works well. I created an Photo Filter adjustment layer with a warming filter and adjusted the filter until it removed the blue in the blue-tinted white areas. The adjustment is shown below.
The layer’s mask was then inverted to black to completely conceal the adjustment. A Lights luminosity selection was created to target the whites in the scene, and the marching ants were hidden. White paint was applied onto the layer mask to the blue-tinted white areas of the image. The lights selection helped target the paint to the lighter/whiter areas being painted. While this step was originally intended to remove the cool color in some of the whites, revealing some warmth in specific darker areas seemed to work well too. Because the Lights selection reaches into some of the darker tones, painting darker parts of the image turned out to be an effective way to warm-up other cool-toned areas as well. Below is the mask for the Photo Filter layer after it was painted showing the areas that were revealed to receive the warming effect. The rollover is the image before the warming was added to provide a better idea of how the blue-tinted areas in the image ware targeted for warming by the painted mask.
Below is the image as it appeared after the addition of the Photo Filter layer with the painted mask. The rollover again shows how the image looked before the Photo Filter adjustment layer was added. The blue-tinted areas in the rollover are now obvious and these areas look more coherent with the rest of the image once they’re warmed up, but again, it took viewing the print to see how this adjustment could benefit the image.
The final layer for this image involved color-cloning. While not all that bothersome in the on-screen version of the image, the unmatched rock color in the upper parts of the image, especially the upper right, looked unbalanced in the print. Revealing the Photo Filter warming didn’t help correct this A curve adjustment could be used to shift the color and then this color change could be revealed in the off-color rocks, but since there is plenty of the “right” color readily available in other parts of the image, an easier method is to simply paint in the desired color using the cloning color, retaining texture technique. Using this technique, the final layer is a pixel-containing layer set to Color blending mode. The desired color was sampled from other areas of the image and painted into this new layer where color change was desired. This technique worked particularly well for this image since the underlying color was slightly darker than the sampled color being painted into the layer. Color-cloning tends to lighten the painted area just a bit, so painting over a darker color keeps the area from appearing too light after painting. Generally when using this technique, I just paint the color onto the Color Clone layer at a low opacity to build up the color to the desired level. In parts of this image, however, I wanted to limit the color change to just the darker tones, so I painted through a Dark Darks and Shadow Darks selections to avoid adding the tint to the lighter tones. The image below is what the Color Clone layer looks like. Remember, this layer is set to Color blending mode so only the hue and saturation of things in this layer are transmitted to the image. The luminosity, which defines texture, comes from the composite of the layers below. The rollover shows the image before color cloning in order to see which areas were targeted to receive paint.
Below is how the image looked after color-cloning. The rollover is before this technique was applied. It’s a subtle change that once again probably benefits the print more than the on-line version.
In summary then, four techniques were used to provide the finishing touches to this image: luminosity painting, a Curves adjustment through a Basic Mid-tones mask, a painted mask with a Photo Filter adjustment layer, and color-cloning. The different layers for these steps are shown below. Each technique was applied after assessing the image (listening) to see where change was needed, and each was specifically chosen to address the particular concern that was uncovered. As often happens, an actual print of the image revealed more than the on-screen version, but adding layers to correct the print also led to subsequent and noticeable improvement in how the image looked on the monitor.
Painted Masks
NOTE: A more complete description of this mask painting technique can be found here.
Luminosity painting is one of my favorite Photoshop techniques and is described in a this tutorial. It is a method for burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) specific areas of an image and specific tones in those areas by painting through luminosity selections.
Painting a layer mask for an adjustment layer is another example on how luminosity painting can be used. It provides a method to first make a global adjustment using an adjustment layer, then hiding it, and then painting to very precisely reveal the adjustment in exact areas and tones in the image.
The image below shows the final version of an image where an adjustment layer with a painted luminosity mask played an important role during development. The mouse rollover is the image with this adjustment layer’s visibility turned off. (It may take a few moments for the second image to load, but once it does, you should be able to pass the mouse back and forth across the edge of the frame to flip between the before and after allow greater customization depending on what the image needs.
To make this adjustment, I started by first creating a Curves adjustment layer and changing the blending mode to Multiply. how the image looked after doing this.
While clearly excessive when not moderated by a mask or decreased layer opacity, Multiply (and its image-lightening counterpart, Screen) blending mode tend to make very natural-looking tonal changes to the image when properly applied. Provided that they are used in moderation, these blending modes can subtly and appropriately change image tones without unexpected saturation or contrast changes that sometimes accompany Curves and Levels adjustments.
By default, Photoshop creates an all-white, reveal-all layer mask when adjustment layers are created. Once the blending mode is changed to Multiply, the image is clearly too dark because the pure white mask conceals nothing. While Multiply blending mode will benefit parts of the image eventually, this full-on effect is not desired. To return the image to its original state before the adjustment layer was added, simply type Ctrl+I (Mac: Cmd+I) to invert the layer mask from white to black. This completely hides the adjustment from the image. The menu command Image>Adjustments>Invert can also be used to do this. The figure below shows how the new layer looks on the Layers panel. It’s worth noting that no adjustment was made to the curve for this adjustment layer. Changing the blending mode from Normal to Multiply is all that was needed to darken the image.
Once the desired (but exaggerated) adjustment is created and concealed, it’s necessary to create a luminosity selection to paint through to reveal the concealed adjustment just where it’s needed in the image. The easiest way to get the right selection to paint through is to make an entire series of masks on the Channels panel and choose what works best. For this image, I want to darken some of the lighter tones in the image. The Lights-series of luminosity masks provides several choices of masks that target progressively lighter tones. The figure below shows this series of masks as they appear on the Channels panel.
Masks are graphical representations of selections, with light colors showing selected pixels and black representing pixels that aren’t selected. Shades of gray correspond to the degree to which pixels are selected—dark gray pixels are less selected than light gray pixels. Any mask can be turned into a selection with a Ctrl+click (Mac: Cmd+click) on the mask’s thumbnail image.
Examining the masks by clicking them one-by-one on the Channels panel helps find the most appropriate one for this image. The mask that shows white (or light gray) in the areas that need to be changed (darkened in this case) is a good starting point. However, it’s also good to think about combining masks to make an even more refined selection to paint through. For most selections I use for luminosity painting, I’ll generally subtract off a selection at the extreme end of the series. So, for example, in this case I chose the Light Lights mask as targeting the tones I wanted to reveal on the adjustment layer. Instead of just creating a selection from the Light Lights mask and painting through it, however, I also subtracted off the Super Lights. I want the very lightest tones to stay nearly white, and by subtracting them from the selection that is painted through, they won’t receive much paint and will remain concealed from the adjustment and unchanged in the image.
So, after creating the Lights-series of masks on the Channels panel, here’s the process for making my desired selection:
1) Ctrl+click (Mac: Cmd+click) on the Light Lights mask thumbnail—this loads this mask as a selection.
2) Alt+Ctrl+click (Mac: Opt+Cmd+click) on the Super Lights mask thumbnail—this subtracts these tones from the selection.
I now have a selection that is targeting the tones enclosed by marching ants in the figure below–light tones are selected but very whitest tones are not.
: Cmd+H) so they don’t hamper judging the effect that painting has on the image. Even though the selection outline is hidden, the selection will still be active and directing paint to the desired tones.
Single-click on the black layer mask on the adjustment layer making sure the framing brackets are around the mask.
The “color” to paint with is easy: white. The mask is 100% black, completely concealing the blending mode adjustment. To reveal the adjustment in the image, white paint needs to be applied to the mask. So make sure the foreground color is white. Type “D” to reset the colors if white is not the foreground color.
Select the Brush tool by clicking on it on the Tools panel or by typing the letter “B”. The opacity setting for painting will depend somewhat on the mask(s) chosen or combined to make the selection to paint through. Selections made from masks with pure or nearly pure white areas in the mask pass more paint through the selection and require a lower opacity setting to reveal the adjustment. A good starting value for opacity in this case is 10 to 20 percent. Selections made by subtraction within the same series will often have the “white” pixels subtracted out of the selection, so a higher opacity setting is necessary to force paint through the “grayer” pixels that remain. Fifty percent is reasonable choice. One brush stroke is usually NOT sufficient to create the desired or perfect reveal of the blending-mode adjustment. There are two alternatives. If the reveal is insufficient, additional brushstrokes can be applied. Perhaps increasing the opacity or changing the size of the brush (bracket keys) will be necessary. However, layering in multiple brushstrokes to slowly reveal the adjustment is often desirable as long as each stroke makes a slightly visible difference.
If the reveal is too pronounced after a single brushstroke, undo it using Ctrl+Z, (Mac: Cmd+Z), and then lower brush opacity, reduce brush size, or possibly load or create a new, more restrictive selection to paint through.
The goal is to sequentially add white paint to the layer mask to allow some amount. The luminosity selection also insures that less than perfect mousing keeps paint inside the desired tonal lines.
The image below shows the painted mask and can help to better understand what’s happening with this type of luminosity painting.
The first thing that can be seen in the mask is an outline of parts of the image. Since the primary luminosity mask (Lights) is a gray-scale of the original image, all subsequent luminosity masks derived from this primary mask show image detail as well. A selection created by subtracting different luminosity masks, as was done in this case, still has partially selected pixels that mimic the luminosity in the original image. Painting through a selection based on the pixel variables in the original image (a pixel-based selection) recreates the contours of the image in all subsequent masks and when painting through these masks. defined by single mask, the mask can be enhanced in any area by simply applying more white paint through the selection. The enhancement can continue until the area being painted is 100% white, a complete reveal of the adjustment layer’s adjustment.. So it’s like using several luminosity masks on one layer mask and choosing which parts of them and to what degree they will benefit the image. In this case, most of the painting was done through the Light Lights minus Super Lights selection described above, but when repeated brushstrokes started to reveal darkening in some adjacent areas where darkening was not desired, a Bright Lights minus Super Lights selection was used to restrict the reveal of the adjustment to even lighter tones in the image.
Once you have a feel for luminosity painting, using it to create or enhance layer masks becomes a logical next step. Painting through a pixel-based selection, like a luminosity mask, applies paint in proportion to the pixel-based selection(s) in the original mask. The pixel-based quality of the mask is retained so that. I hope that you’ll try it and that your images will benefit from this technique.

eBooks from My Friends
Steffen and Isa Synnatschke and Guy Tal have recently released new eBooks. This electronic publication format is becoming increasingly popular as photographers attempt to share what they know with a larger audience without the expense of traditional publishing and distribution of actual books. Tal and the Synnatschkes are good friends who I’ve encouraged to write and share what they have to offer as I believe their unique perspectives will resonate with many nature photographers. These new eBooks validate this conviction. Both offer new insights into what makes photography such a popular activity, and both provide photographers new avenues for exploration.
Guy Tal’s blog is widely followed for its insightful commentary on photography. There is almost an infectious passion in his words that makes readers want to take their own photography to a higher level. Tal is now bringing this enthusiasm to a series of eBooks that take a deeper look at the creative aspects that inform his own body of work. The first was entitled “Creative Landscape” and it took readers into the natural world to explore processes for extracting personal and original compositions. It was a combination of practical knowledge and spiritual attunement that is at the heart of the creative process. The new eBook, “Creative Processing Techniques,” provides a similar perspective, but this time applied to image processing in Photoshop.
The emphasis on creativity in this publication is obvious from this excerpt:
“Given the irregular and unpredictable nature of creative epiphanies, your processing workflow should not be linear or very strict, but rather one of continuous refinement until the desired result is achieved. While the process has a known beginning (the RAW file) and a desired outcome (the visualized image), the transition from one to the other may be the equivalent of navigating a complex maze of paths and creative choices. A non-linear, or iterative, approach is one that relies on progressive refinement and course correction; where goals are re-examined at every step and inform the next iteration in ways that may not be obvious from the start. For best results, we may sometimes need to take a step sideways or even backwards before moving forward.”. Once again, Tal’s own words are probably best:
“The digital studio offers boundless opportunity for creative expression, experimentation and infusing your work with your own style and vision. Seen in this light, it is much more than just a set of tools for adjusting or correcting pixels. Rather, it is the place where your thoughts and ideas take shape and manifest themselves visually in your creations.”
This combination of practical application of software with creative exploration of the light is very much in line with my own concept of how we should approach our images and their light. I consider myself reasonably facile with Photoshop, but I still learned new techniques in Tal’s book that I’ll use to process my images from here on. And while I read it front to back to glean these pearls, it was the message that image processing is an integral part of photographic creativity that resonated most strongly. Guy Tal’s ability to fuse practical skills and existential concepts into eminently readable prose helps us all become better photographers.
_____________________________________
Steffen and Isa Synnatschke are perhaps the premier place-finders when it comes to the Colorado Plateau. From their home in Dresden, Germany, they scour many online resources to assemble bits of information on possible places to photograph during their semiannual trips to the United States. They explore continuously while they’re here and, based on my own time spent in their company, frequently walk right to the place they are looking to find. Wind Song, Sandstone Nebulae, Towers of Hasi Nagi, Lower Chamber, Sitting Ducks, Desert Mushroom, Momo’s Brain, and The Wing and a Prayer are examples of images from my website that owe their existence to the Synnatschkes and their irrepressible quest for new light. Their websites (linked above) show just how many places they’ve photographed and how dedicated they are to good light.
The iconic quality of many of the places discovered by the Synnatschkes makes these locations a natural draw for many photographers. If your vacation and picture-taking time is limited, photogenic subjects in the right light help insure you’ll come home with many good pictures. The Synnatschkes are particularly adept at sniffing out such sites. They have spent nearly a decade traveling and finding these places and are finally starting to share their secrets in the “Closer Look” eGuide series. They recently released their first book centered on the fascinating sandstone of Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada.
This park has been one of their favorite locations over the years, and they have hiked and photographed here extensively. This is an extraordinary place with unusual sandstone everywhere you look. Their desire to explore and eye for composition have uncovered many places within the park whose photographic potential was previously unrecognized. The eGuide provides detailed information about these places: how to get there, GPS waypoints, and recommendations on the best time of day for exposure. If you’re planning to visit the Southwest and are interested in seeing or photographing some astonishing sandstone, Valley of Fire State Park should be on your itinerary and the Closer Look eGuide to it should be in your daypack.

Of late, my 8-year-old has been giving a lot of thought to marriage—and more specifically, to finding a husband. To wit: When her friend turned down several snack options in a row, El sought me out.
“Mom, she is a PICKY eater. She’s going to have trouble getting a husband if she eats like that.”
And later: “I think it would be good to know geometry before you try to get a husband, because…” She pondered. “Because then you’d both know it.”
Right-o. I mean, I’m not sure that both people knowing the difference between an acute and an obtuse triangle would qualify as being “equally yoked,” but it couldn’t hurt.
El’s musings got me thinking. I watch The Bachelor, I admit it. And, yes, I disrespect myself in the morning, but I am fascinated by what young women and men assume will make a relationship work. Two minutes into meeting the prize—AKA, the bachelor—beautiful, seemingly bright women are passionately kissing this virtual stranger and claiming they’re sure he’s the one. By the end of the evening, these same girls are sobbing inconsolably, because the bachelor has given their coveted rose to somebody else.
Well, duh.
To all past, current, and future ABC bachelorettes: I’m going to give you a little advice, and you should take it, because I’m a romance novelist, and I know about happily ever afters.
When you meet someone you consider forever-after material, keep your lips clamped unless you are opening your mouth to talk. To talk, ladies. You will not know he’s the one for you simply because you feel goose-pimply after he kisses you and fifteen other girls at an alcohol-soaked cocktail party. (I’d feel goose pimply, too. Eew.) This is romance 101: Save your kisses for someone who’s kissing only you.
From now on, I want you to heed the wisdom of my 8-year-old: At the very least, find out if you both like geometry before you begin doodling your name together with his on a cocktail napkin.
I tell my daughter all the time, “Marry your best friend.” At the moment she’s taking me literally and is considering walking down the aisle with one of her girlfriends. “’Cause we talk about everything, and we could share the same wedding dress, and wedding dresses are very expensive, Mom.’”
I question the practicality of two women and one dress in the same wedding, but I appreciate that she’s budget-minded and, for the moment at least, wise enough to want to spend her life with someone she knows, likes and respects.
As for The Bachelor/ette, Too Hot Mamas must send the show to the front of its Doody Head line asap. Of course, I suppose I have to walk it there myself.

At least your daughter is exploring ideas of what a marriage should be when she is 8 and not when she’s on a reality TV show!
Also, I agree with the “marry your best friend” advice.
D.I.V.O.R.C.E. teach her the words to the Tammy Wynette song. they may also come in handy.
Funny. A wee bit frightening too. She’s an early bloomer, eh?

I just found this youtube video online that has some good clips of the race. At about 34 seconds into the video, I am the first rider around the corner with Andy Crater behind me. Andy had just won the $200 prime, and I decided to keep rolling in case a break came up to us. It did, but our break only lasted for maybe half a lap before the field caught back up to us.
Detailed Summary
Nearly 140 riders lined up for the start of the race. I got to the staging area real early, but after all the callups and people rolling in front of the staging area, I ended up on the third row for the start. Better than at the back, but not ideal. Fortunately, somebody in front and to the right of me had trouble clipping in, and this opened up a hole so I was able to zip around him and into the top 15 or so. The pace was fast, but manageable. Then at the start of the sixth or seventh lap, the announcer rang the bell for a $200 prime. I wasn’t intending to go for the prime, but I was already at the front when Emile Abraham (Aerocat) attacked with his teammate Andy Crater on his wheel. I was right there so I jumped in third wheel as we got a small gap on the field going into turn 5 and 6. Out of turn 6, Emile peeled off and Andy launched his sprint. I tried to come around, but couldn’t do it and had to settle for second (i.e., nothing).
I was happy to be in contention for the prime, but it was a lot of wasted energy. I spent the next 20+ laps trying to recover and work my way back to the front of the group. It was pretty crazy back in the pack and it took a really concerted effort to work my way all the way back to the front. A few thoughts kept running through my mind:
- “The #1 rule in moving forward is to NOT move backward”
- “Gee, it’s still a really long way to the front” when the group was strung out single file ahead of me
- “How on earth am I not to the front, yet? Who is passing me and when?”
Finally, with less than 15 laps left to go, I had worked my way back into the top 20-25 riders. It was much smoother, and not too hard to maintain that position as long as you made sure to pass people on at least two different parts of the course. This was the status quo for the next 8 laps when with 7 laps to go (no more free laps), the announcer rang the bell for a $750 prime. Coming through the start/finish line, I was sitting maybe 20th wheel but carrying some momentum so I swung to the outside, moved up to maybe 10th wheel when the group in front veered right opening a hole for me on the wind-protected side of the group. Without hesitation, I attacked as hard as I could hoping to get a gap that nobody would want to close. Unfortunately, I brought two riders with me – Rahsaan Bahati and a Mountain Khakis rider (Myerson or Howe). Nevertheless, I knew that Kristine would be excited to see me off the front so I drilled it and we absolutely flew through turns 2, 3, and 4. Turn 3 was a right turn, followed by a short 1 block straight away and then a left turn. I was going so fast through those corners that it felt like a corkscrew instead of two 90 degree turns! Plus I caught the pace car coming out of Turn 4 so we did get a little bit of a draft up the hill. By the end of those turns, we had a 5-10 second gap on the field. I was in the front and coming off turn 5, I coasted hoping that one of them would come around, but they didn’t. We gradually slowed down and started our sprint for the $750 prime from about 23mph with a comfortable gap on the field. I’d like to say that I crushed the sprint against one of the top sprinters in the country and walked away with $750, but what actually happened is that Rahsaan won by maybe 15 bike lengths, the Mountain Khakis rider was next, and then I trailed in maybe 3 or 4 seconds later with the field coming up hard.
Strategically, going for the prime wasn’t the best thing I could do — but I had the opportunity, and I wasn’t going to let it slip away and wonder what would’ve, could’ve, should’ve, etc… The only strategic advantage about going for the prime is that it meant I was at the very front of the race with 6 laps to go. When the pack came by, I knew that it was going to hurt, but I drilled it as hard as I could and slotted somewhere into the top 20 riders. The pace was fast with Aerocat, Bahati, and Mountain Khakis riders at the front drilling it. Even so, there was a lot of shuffling where riders from the back would carry more momentum and push forward ahead of the leadout riders. I tried to anticipate those “surges” and ended up in the top 15 with one lap to go.
The last lap was really fast, but I was able to move up a couple more positions going into the last corner and the downhill sprint. So I already knew at this point that barring an accident, I was going to place in the top 20 maybe even top 10. Well, with 100 meters to go, there was an accident — a bad one. According to my bike computer, I was going 39mph in the downhill, tailwind sprint when the accident happened. The sole BMC rider in the race, Cole House, got tangled up with a Mountain Khakis rider and the two of them went down at the front of the sprint — immediately in front of me. A third rider in front of me and to my right went down as he collided with another rider trying to avoid the original accident. Since I was going 39mph with very little time to react, I had already resigned myself to the fact that I was going to fall when I realized that if I punched it I could maybe squeeze between the riders and bikes on the ground to my left and right. The only obstacle was the BMC rider’s bike which was currently up in the air. It was just off to my left though so I ran into it with my shoulder and pushed it out of the way and very, very luckily no part of it got tangled up with my bike. So I made it through, but according to my computer I had slowed down to under 30mph. A lot of people were having to hit the brakes and slow down because of the accident, but there was still room for some people to come around carrying speed so I ended up getting passed by 3 or 4 people in the final 50 meters while I was trying to get back up to speed. Still, I was very happy (and lucky) to have stayed upright and finish 14th.
Brent Mahan (Nashville Cyclist) finished 11th riding a great race and has now moved into the green jersey for best young U25 rider! Congratulations Brent!

Mississippi Gran Prix – Day 2 – Road Race and Time Trial
April 14, 2012 at 11:09 pm 1 comment
Quick Summary
My teammate Pat Allison and I took 6th and 7th in the road race in a strategic 80+ mile road race. My other teammate Justin got into a great two-man move for over half of a 27 mile lap. This forced other teams to chase and gave Pat and I a much needed break from attacking and covering moves. Unfortunately, Justin’s break-mate Russell Walker flatted towards the end of the second lap. Earlier in the race, I had my own bad luck with a broken rear spoke, but Pat and Justin stopped and helped pace me back up to the group – awesome teammates! Later in the evening, we all rocked the TT merckx style and had decent times.
The Data
I didn’t have power data from the road race b/c of the broken spoke in my powertap rear wheel. I had the iBike on, but then the wheel magnet on my front wheel slid down so the iBike shut off with no speed data coming into it.

As the UK launch date for iPhone 4 is drawing near, potential buyers are busy in assessing available price plans announced by the different providers.
Apple’s much-anticipated iPhone 4 will be available from 24th of June via almost all major network providers including Vodafone, O2, Orange and AT&T. Three network providers viz. Vodafone, O2 and Orange have already announced tariffs for the upcoming phone.
Vodafone has also announced pricing for the iPhone 4, with a range of plans staring from £25-a-month. All of its monthly plans offer 1GB mobile internet and webmail plus 1GB of Wi-Fi with Openzone.
Comparatively, the cheapest deal on Orange is £30-a-month on a 24-month contract, while its "unlimited" mobile internet browsing and Wi-Fi packages are capped at 750MB each a month.

50 Nonprofit Mission Statements
Many nonprofit mission statements succumb to an over use of words in general, but especially jargon. Good mission statements should be clear, memorable, concise. While I'm tempted to add "inspiractional" to this list, I find that the end product often ends up as a frankenstein that is part mission statement, part vision statement, and almost always too long.

This week's parsha begins with the dissention of Korach, a cousin of Moshe
Rabbainu. He challenged Moshe's authority to appoint Aharon, his brother,
as Kohein Gadol, or High Priest. Korach, Doson, Avirom, and 250 men, mostly
from the tribe of Reuven, teamed up against Moshe. Rashi, (the medieval
French Commentator) writes that Korach was disgruntled about the
appointment of his younger cousin as Prince over his family, while he felt
the position was coming to him.
The Sages of the Talmud comment about Korach and his colleagues as follows.
"Any dispute which is for the sake of heaven will endure, and any dispute
which is not for the sake of heaven will not endure. What is a dispute
which is for the sake of heaven? This is the dispute between Hillel and
Shammai. (And) What is the dispute which is not for the sake of heaven?
This is the dispute between Korach and his followers" (Chapters of the
Fathers). There are a few questions about this, as follows.
A dispute for the sake of heaven is one which is borne out of similar
intentions to ascertain the truth. The opponents are, in reality, on the
same team. Hillel and Shammai may have had differing perspectives about how
to understand the application of a Torah law, but they both wanted to
observe the law as G-d intended them to.
The ability for the dispute to "endure" is that the goal of the opponents
endures, not the dispute, because the underlying intentions are "for the
sake of heaven," and not for selfish ends.
Korach's dispute was not between Korach and Moshe. Korach and Moshe were
not opponents. Korach's intentions were not the same as Moshe's. They were
motivated by his perceived loss of dignity at the appointment of his
younger cousin, not that G-d be served according to His will. Since Korach
and his followers were all motivated by selfish ends, none of them were
really on the same team. Each one teamed up with the other so that he could
attain his own selfish goal. None of them were acting on behalf of the
bigger picture. This is why the Sages say that the dispute was between
Korach and his followers.
There is a proof that Korach and his followers' intentions were selfish.
The test they were willing to undergo to choose a new High Priest was that
each one would bring a sacrifice of "Ketores," a blend of particular
spices. Each one knew that only one man's sacrifice would be accepted, and
only he would live through the test. Still they were willing to go through
with it.
Before we enter into disagreements with others we would benefit by
remembering the mistake of Korach and his followers. We might ask ourselves
together with an objective third party the following questions. Why do I
care about this? Is it for the sake of truth, or for my own concerns? What
might I lose if I get involved? What might the world gain? Will it really
matter in the long run if I get my way?
In conclusion, there is a passage in the morning liturgy. It describes the
way the ministering angels sanctify G-d each day. "And they encourage each
other to sanctify their Creator etc. The Eitz Yosef, one of the
authoritative commentators of the liturgy, writes as follows. "They
encourage each other to sanctify G-d. Their focus is not on who does the
job; rather their main concern is that the job be done." The ministering
angels are team players. Let us take their example in our lives, and be
better for it.
Good Shabbos.

U.S. Team has loaded staff for Futures Game
Bundy, Cole, Hultzen among plethora of high-ranked pitching prospects to play Sunday
The SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game always assembles the best talent the Minor Leagues has to offer, but when looking at the United States Team's pitching, it's safe to say no one has seen a more powerful staff of prospects assembled in recent memory.
The 10 pitchers on the U.S. club for Sunday's game are a veritable who's who of pitching prospects. All of them are among MLB.com's Top 100, starting with the Orioles' Dylan Bundy, who is ranked No. 7, and finishing with an under-valued Matt Barnes of the Red Sox, who is No. 95.
Seven are former first-round Draft picks, including five from 2011. The Pirates' Gerrit Cole and the Mariners' Danny Hultzen were the top two picks a year ago. Bundy went No. 4. Barnes was the No. 19 overall pick in 2011, while Alex Meyer of the Nationals went four picks later at No. 23. The Mets' Zack Wheeler went No. 6 in 2009, and Jameson Taillon on the Pirates was the No. 2 pick in 2010.
The other three, all supplement first-round selections -- Jake Odorizzi of the hometown Royals; Trevor Bauer's replacement, fellow Diamondback Tyler Skaggs, Taijuan Walker of the Mariners -- aren't far behind.
"Wow," an American League professional scouting director said. "What you're talking about is the No. 1 pitching prospect from each of those guys' organizations. I don't think there's been a more talented staff. That's a pretty impressive group right there."
Said a National League pro scouting director: "First and foremost, they all have the chance to be impact pitchers. Sometimes when you're putting rosters for All-Star games together, you have to balance who's available. This time, there's a legit chance every one of them ends up at least in the front end of a Major League rotation, and that's kind of unusual."
Before seeing them fronting those rotations, fans can watch this staff in action live on MLB.com, ESPN2 and ESPN2 HD and follow MLB clubs, selected the 25-man rosters. Hall of Famer George Brett will manage the U.S. Team, with former Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams doing the honors for the World Team.
The fact that the U.S. pitching staff is so stacked is a direct testament to what teams have been doing in the First-Year Player Draft, especially in recent years. The first round of the 2011 Draft -- so well represented on the roster -- saw 19 pitchers selected out of 33 picks. Led by Taillon, 14 more, out of 32 picks, went in 2010's first round. Walker was taken No. 43 overall in that Draft. In 2009, Wheeler's year, half of the first round (16) were pitchers. Skaggs was the 40th pick in 2009, while Odorizzi went No. 32 in 2008.
"If you look at the last couple of Drafts, there's been a pitching-heavy [slant]," the NL scouting director said. "That's starting to show up in Minor League All-Star games."
What's even more impressive is that these arms are not that far off from the ultimate goal: hitting a big league rotation. One day on a Major League mound for the Futures Game is great, but the idea is for them to call that home for the long-term. As the NL scout pointed out, all 10 heading to Kansas City this weekend have the chance to do that. And quickly.
Hultzen, Odorizzi and Skaggs are all currently in Triple-A, each having earned promotions after starting the year in Double-A. Cole recently moved up to Double-A, joining Walker and Wheeler at that level. Barnes and Bundy are both in the Class A Advanced Carolina League, having both earned bumps up with their performances this season. Taillon, in the Florida State League, has been at that level all year, leaving just Meyer as the lone member of the staff in the lowest level of full-season ball.
"I think all of these guys are within a calendar year of impacting their clubs, easily," the AL scouting director said.
The timing is right, too, in that all of these pitchers were available for the Futures Game in the first place. The stars were definitely aligned that each player's organization allowed them to be chosen, that each has been performing well for stretches, if not all, of this season, that all were healthy and that none of them other than Bauer had been called up to the big leagues.
"Pitching, especially dominant pitching, tends not to spend too much time in the Minor Leagues," the NL pro scouting director said. "[With this roster] you have college pitching right on track. The high school pitcher have forced their way up and haven't hit any bumps. They haven't seen a lot of hiccups yet. They all fit with the Futures Game mix at this point."

Duly Quoted: Paul Godfrey on a Downtown Casino
OLG chair says casinos shouldn't go in residential neighbourhoods—which is why it's fine to have one downtown.
“I live in a residential neighbourhood. It has what I would describe as either single-family homes or townhouses or places where people live. But I wouldn’t describe all of downtown as a neighbourhood. Downtown has stores and offices and places of entertainment and restaurants.”
—Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation Chair Paul Godfrey to the Globe and Mail, in an attempt to clarify remarks he made during a speech to the National Club on Tuesday [PDF]. Among his comments: “I gotta tell you, I wouldn’t want [a casino] in my neighbourhood, but at the same time you’re not putting it in a residential area.” Councillor Adam Vaughan (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina) quickly condemned those remarks in an open letter to provincial finance minister Dwight Duncan, writing: “These [downtown] communities deserve not only to be recognized by your government and its appointees, but their rights and quality of life deserve the same consideration as Mr. Godfrey’s neighbours and friends.”
Of the locations currently being considered for a Toronto casino, three—Exhibition Place, the convention centre, and the Port Lands—are close to a substantial number of homes or planned residential growth, although not perhaps in a form Godfrey recognizes, since they are primarily condos rather than single family homes.
The first public consultation meeting about a potential casino takes place tonight at City Hall.
This post originally listed Ontario Place as a possible location for a Toronto casino. It has been changed to Exhibition Place.This post originally listed Ontario Place as a possible location for a Toronto casino. It has been changed to Exhibition Place.

Darwin Strikes Back: Defending the Science of Intelligent Design
by Thomas Woodward
Baker Books, 2006
(224 pages, $14.99, paperback)
reviewed by Louis Markos
The intelligent design (ID) movement has come a long way since Phillip E.
Johnson’s crusading book, Darwin on Trial (1991), challenged
its readers to question not only the science behind Darwinian (macro) evolution
but also the academic-political-media establishment that dismisses as “unscientific” any
discussion of origins that does not adhere religiously to the dogma of scientific
naturalism.
Johnson’s call was heard by Michael Behe, who, in Darwin’s
Black Box (1996), argued that Darwinian (naturalistic) evolution was
incapable of assembling complex chemical structures, and by William Dembski,
who, in The Design Inference (1998), proposed a method by which
researchers could test whether a phenomenon was the result of necessity,
chance, or design.
Critical Shift
Still, the movement lacked a historian. Enter Thomas Woodward, who teaches
systematic theology and the history of science at Trinity College of Florida,
whose 2003 book Doubts About Darwin provided a clear and comprehensive
history of the major figures, books, and breakthroughs that have marked the
growing success of ID.
In Darwin Strikes Back, he explores the animosity that ID has provoked
from the academy and the media. He carefully documents how its critics have
changed their tactics since 2000, shifting from ridicule andcondescension to
outright attack and accusation, attempting to undercut ID’s strong scientific
foundation while associating ID with theocracy, witch trials, and the end of
progress. No longer willing (or able) to ignore the arguments of ID, they have
grown increasingly dishonest and uncivil.
The charge that ID is religion disguised as science was, of course, raised
against Johnson, but the “religion, not science” label, used sporadically
in the 1990’s, became [after 2000] a vehement first volley in almost
every rhetorical encounter between the two sides. Often it was closely tied
to the charge that many adherents of ID theory were known to be “religious” or,
even more rhetorically poisonous, “fundamentalists.”
In God, the Devil, and Darwin (2004), for example, an Oxford University
Press book praised by Science as a “cogent and well-argued
alarum” that “deftly skewers the scientific pretensions of intelligent
design creationists,” historian of science Niall Shanks declared that “a
culture war is currently being waged in the United States by religiousextremists
who hope to turn the clock of science back to medieval times.” This war
is an important fragment of a much larger rejection of the secular, rational,
democratic ideals of the Enlightenment upon which the United States was founded.
The chief weapon in this war is a version of creation science known as Intelligent
Design Theory. . . . At the fat end [of ID’s wedge strategy] lurks
the specter of fundamentalist Christian theocracy.
According to Woodward, one of the key players in the fight against ID’s “fundamentalist
takeover” is Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science
Education (NCSE), whose “goal is not only to warn the pro--evolution
constituency of these threats but to seek to block and thwart them at every
turn.” As a typical example of the extent of her efforts, he documents
how, along with the ACLU, she pressured a Washington state high-school superintendent
into prohibiting a biology teacher from bringing into his classroom information
critical of Darwinism, even though that information had appeared in prestigious,
peer-reviewed journals.
ID Strikes Back
Having established the general rhetorical tone of ID criticism, Woodward
surveys the major critiques not only of Behe’s irreducible complexity
and Dembski’s design inference, but of ID research in the fields of paleontology
(the Cambrian Explosion), biochemistry (DNA), physics and cosmology (the Big
Bang and the Finely Tuned Universe), and the history of science (textbook misinformation).
He then lets us hear Behe and the others answer, point by point, the charges
of their critics.
Woodward concludes with a promise: that the wedge ID has driven into Darwinism
will soon (“by 2025 at the latest”) split open the “aging
paradigm” of “nature-driven macroevolution.” New naturalistic
paradigms will spring up to take the place of Darwinism, but he argues that
these new paradigms will be less rigidly defined and will allow for the parallel
growth of ID research that accepts microevolution (adaptation) while insisting
on the need for design.
Although well organized and uniformly engaging, Darwin Strikes Back badly
needs a timeline that can double as a bibliography. Woodward is most helpful
in documenting ID responses to what I consider the most successful anti-ID
book of the last decade, Kenneth Miller’s Finding Darwin’s
God (1999), but he needs to devote more than two pages to answering the
critiques of Evangelical and Catholic Darwinists who argue that God initiated
the universe but subsequently refrained from intervening in nature.
Still, these are minor concerns. Darwin Strikes Back offers both
a unique, rhetorical history of the ID versus Darwinism debate and an accessible
primer on how proponents of ID may best defend their position. Club”.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Robert Khuzami is leaving the Securities and Exchange Commission after leading the agency's efforts to penalize the nation's largest banks for actions that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.
Khuzami was named enforcement director in February 2009, just months after the crisis peaked. In his four years at the helm, he spearheaded investigations that accused banks of misleading investors about risky mortgage securities.
His efforts drew large SEC settlements. Goldman Sachs agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million to settle civil fraud charges. Similar deals followed with Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and others.
Critics have said the penalties were a small compared with the banks' revenue and no senior executives were held accountable.
Khuzami is stepping down within a month of former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro's departure from the agency.

Welcome to the first "The Week in ID Checks." Each Friday from now until the election, I will be keeping track of where and how many times I am asked to present government issued photo identification during the week as Attorney General Eric Holder continues his quest to squash Voter ID laws across the country. Now, I am well aware the argument that the following activities are not constitutional rights will be made (voting is a right), but the point is, when I am asked to present photo identification it is simply because I am required to prove who I say I am. Should voting be any different considering it is more important? Nope. Not to mention, this project will be an example of how any American cannot efficiently function or do basic everyday things without government issued

Songstress Keri Hilson lays down vocals for ‘Freedom Ride’!
The cut, lifted from the ‘Think Like a Man’ soundtrack, is a clappy number layered with piano melodies and some electric strings. On the song, the singer puts on the emotional tap while lamenting on the loss of her relationship (to another woman). Before the split, they travelled on the freedom train of sorts making a pact not to let it ruin what they had. Turns out, she stuck to her end of the deal, and well, he didn’t, leaving the singer absolutely heart broken. ‘Freedom Ride’ is a very solid track and her vocals have really picked up over the years. The musical compilation will be available from April 10th, while the movie hits the big screen on April 20th. Take a listen to Keri’s heartfelt track about lost love, after the jump!

The leaves are turning and we've been seeing roadside signs for haunted hayrides and corn mazes. It might just be time for some spooky music. This record is a bit of a dark horse as I had never heard of it until recently. But it's a gorgeous little album of how should I say... noir exotica? There are hypnotic organs and flutes, chiming mallet instruments and a particular electric bass guitar sound that I like to call "punchy." This music is way, way ahead of its time, as if it were meant to have been buried and re-discovered somewhere in Bristol or Birmingham in the mid-1990s.
Good stuff. Reminds me of Peter Thomas' soundtrack for Raumpatrouille Orion.
cool, i don't think i've heard that.
Noir exotica? Nice!
@Ben, oh you should check it out. Essential space exotica.
And (in the main theme) also probably the first recorded use of a Vocoder in pop music, as I just read in Dave Tompkins' epic book about the history of the vocoder.
Well, if you had to write scores for future dances like this one in 1966:
@dispo - thank you VERY much for recommendation!
It is always time for spooky music. Always.
And yes, it is awesome. The soundtrack for black cars driving down foggy roads strewn with yellow leaves. Thank you!
Sir, this is marvellous.
But I must know more.
Principally:
1. Where did you find it?
2. What year is it from?
3. The artist is listed as P. Reno - is this correct?
Any help would be much appreciated.
I think the record is from 1969. Half of the tracks are by P. Reno and the other half by Reg Wale.
this is marvelous indeed! i love it. it's been ages since i've heard a library lp as good as this. moody, introspective and oozing with raw emotion. i live for this kind of music right here. thank you for sharing this.
INTERESTING!!
Peter Reno is two dudes. I knew it was linked to Dawn of the Dead somehow!

Ticket #137 (closed defect: fixed)
Time zone name wrong in waterfall header (says I'm in DST when I'm not)
Description
Here in November in the US Pacific Time zone, we're currently observing standard time (PST). However, the header of the waterfall display says it's PDT.
In status/web/waterfall.py, function "body", around line 503:
TZ = time.tzname[time.daylight]
Should be:
TZ = time.tzname[time.localtime()[-1]]
It turns out that time.daylight only tells you if the region you're in observes DST at some time of the year; if you want to know whether or not DST is *currently in effect*, you need the last item of the localtime time tuple.
Twisted's log.py also makes this mistake, causing log.msg to report the time wrong in the twistd.log(s).
A similar fix is probably needed in tests/tests_web.py, line 235 (Class Waterfall, def _check1)
Change History
comment:2 Changed 5 years ago by warner

Abstract
Teacher effectiveness has been a rallying cry for education reform over the last decade. The push for policies that aim to increase teacher effectiveness, fire ineffective teachers and recruit or retain effective teachers unite educational stakeholders; yet, specific, operational definitions of effectiveness remain elusive and divisive. It is easy to say that teacher effectiveness is the single most important factor in student achievement, but difficult to say what it means to be effective. In this study I take up a Critical Discursive Psychology (Wetherell, 1998) approach to the text of the current Framework for Teacher Evaluation and Professional Growth in Tennessee and the talk of the Teacher Evaluation Advisory Committee (TEAC)– a 15-member committee appointed to craft a new evaluation policy with Race To The Top funds under the First To the Top Act. My findings suggest that there are polarized interpretative repertoires available for talking and making sense of effectiveness in teaching. These ways of talking about teaching create conflicts and dilemmas within conversations that are managed in patterned ways. Within the talk of the TEAC, patterns in the way dilemmas are managed within conversations include evading and dividing decisions points in ways that support a self-extending system of education reform. My findings suggest that teacher effectiveness is constantly being constructed within conversations, rather than being a single idea that can be singularly and authoritatively defined and handed down. As such I argue that teacher effectiveness policies must purposefully engage individuals at all levels of policy and practice in ongoing conversations about effectiveness in teaching and the evaluation of teaching in order to mediate the unintended consequences of tools for evaluation, and to develop a shared vision of excellence for collaborative progress.

So here we are in Manila.
I tell you what, I haven’t had a chance to scratch myself since we got here. It’s been crazy, manic, hectic from the word go.
Within the first ten minutes of being here I nearly got ran over by a motorbike as we walked (ran) down the side of the traffic laden street.
I mean I had to turn my body sidewards, against a parked truck and suck both my belly AND my breasts right in to avoid being hit. Don’t ask me how you suck your breasts IN, but believe me it’s possible.
But even BEFORE that I had the biggest major anxiety provoking experience…
Landing in Thailand (We stayed there overnight before coming to Manila)
So…there we were, after eight looooong hours about to land. My favourite part. Yay! I get to put my feet firmly back on the ground where they belong.
So we’re descending, ears popping, chewing gum like mad, looking excitedly out the window as the ground is coming closer (when you can see past the smog that is.)
The houses are looking like little lego houses, tiny cars are coming into view on little weeny roads….rice fields (I don’t know….wet fields of something they looked like) patchworking the landscape…and there is the runway, aaaaand we’re almost there….I’m just waiting, holding my breath waiting for the inevitable bump as the plane touches the ground……aaaaaand…..VRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
What?
We’re going up?
Wait?
Oh SHIT!
We’re zooming up into the air again….
Christ!
Are we going to make it?
What about the tail?
What’s happening!!!!!!!
Umm….there was another plane in the way.
In the bloody way. A great big airbus taking it’s merry old time down there on the runway… MY runway, where I want to be safely set down on the ground THANK YOU, and it’s right in the path of the plane I’m trying to land in.
Can you imagine?
I’d never imagined that scenario….or the feeling of that roar of power when you’re actually still suspended in the air!
Man! What a truly frightening feeling.
Probably quite ok, for the pilots to, at the very last minute, pull the nose up and roar back up into the sky, but quite freakishly- almost need a change of underwear- nightmarish for me!
So where was I?
Oh yes, getting run over by motorbikes.
I’ve figured out, by watching the locals that to cross a road here you just have to walk…cars don’t stop you see. Pedestrian crossings? Na…purely for decoration.
So you just have to pick a moment, and GO…and do NOT hesitate, for he who hesitates, is…. no more.
Somehow, the cars and jeepneys, buses and motorbikes will dodge you. Not you dodge them…you just walk and God is with you.
Something like that.
God is with me anyway. “Oh God, oh God, ohhhhh God!”
Better still is if you cross with a whole bunch of other people.
Like lemmings, all running towards the cliffs edge.
Somehow, you just join in….and the cars swerve round the lemmings.
It’s absolute madness.
Everybody in a vehicle here honks their horns.
I don’t think they told the Philippino’s what the horn was actually for.
Nah…they’ve made up their own rules.
Honk if you’re impatient.
Honk if the light is red.
Honk if the light turns green.
Honk if the traffic is congested.
Honk if the road is completely clear.
Honk if you’re happy.
Honk if you just farted.
Honk ….just because.
I tell ya, it is driving me INSANE, and what is driving me even more insane is that this apartment we are renting, is eleven floors up, and if is as though we are on ground level and there is NO glass in the windows.
It is SO loud, and all we can hear is the incessant…..honking.
The good thing about it being so incredibly noisy here is that you can fart in public and nobody at all can hear it.
Everybody’s honking!
And there are bad smells drifting in and out of gutters and alleys and out of street food carts….so nobody is the wiser.
Hey, there’s always a bright side.
The kids have taken it all in their stride, I’m pleased to say.
We haven’t had to scrape their jaws off the ground too often, but there have been some experiences thus far that have been a little bit….nerve wracking.
I’ll leave those for further blogging when we get back.
The one child (grown child – my eldest daughter who is back home taking care of the pets and house while we’re away) is NOT coping well.
Actually she’s quite traumatized by the paranormal activity going on there.
She’s just moved back home see, from Western Australia. She’s never stayed at this new house before, but has been quite self sufficient and independent for quite some time now. Quite used to living alone.
Now she knows.
Now she KNOWS.
She’s been hearing and sensing it.
The ghost!
We’re seriously going to have to do something about this situation when we get back.
Just a quick blog for tonight.
I have to be up early to go to have my new porcelain crown fitted. Yes, visited the dentist….all is going well except for when the temporary one fell out as we were sitting in a public place having coffee- right before we were about to go to dinner. (Front tooth….nothing under it but a homeless person looking stump)
I could slip it back in, but to eat with it all just “sitting” there like that would be impossible. I’d swallow it!
The kids were impatient, and hungry.
“Mum just take it out and put it on the table while you’re eating then put it back in when you’re finished!”
I don’t think so! Not there in hoity toity central with millions of well groomed, fancy shmantsy folk around.
So it was a rushed taxi trip back to the dentist so they could cement it back in.
I’m grateful they GAVE me something temporary for a few days while the porcelain one is being made.
In Australia you either walk around with homeless person looking stumps or else pay an exorbitant fee for a temporary more aesthetic fully toothed look.
(Actually, in Australia unless you have loads of money to throw around, you’re usually stuck for good with the homeless person stumps.)
I think it was the incredibly bumpy boat ride the day before that worked that damn temporary tooth loose.
Lucky I didn’t lose it as we battled waves, and buckets of water being thrown in our faces….
More about that….exciting boat ride later.
Now….will the dodgy internet connection let me actually connect long enough to post this?
That is the question.
Yes the dodgy internet worked. I know what you are saying about temp crowns fitted and coming out – I have so been there. Amazing you have had the time to write a post! A window with no glass WTF? Do yo have ants – they have ants- they like beds… juz sayin’
Hysterics with the Honk if you just farted….takes me back reading this – not because of the farts mind… but what you are experiencing. Enjoy and hopefully the crown remains in place!
All good now. Permanent crown is fitted and feeling much better
I can eat without worry now.
Just sounds like they don’t because the traffic noise is SO loud!
No,,,the windows HAVE glass
I’m actually feeling a bit homesick! Craving some peace and quiet.
Wow
sounds worse than getting around Rome.
And I can honestly say that I hope that they never realize the medium of smell-o-rama.
Another close call hey?
I tell you, somebody is watching out for you.
And another thing, what makes you think that “it” the ghost is a malevolent spirit?
This is your friend’s house, yes?
Call me crazy (which should probably be my middle name) but my gut (which is also not without merit) tells me that it is looking out for you and those you love.
Hope those new pearly’s don’t effect your singing voice.
Sorry but the mention of coffee and dentistry always reminds me of the movie “10″ with Dudley Moore.
You didn’t happen to be looking at any hunks while you were drinking your coffee did you?

» Kenworth shows concept van
Nov 1, 2011 12:00 PM,
By Rick Weber
This concept truck from Kenworth is designed for improved aerodynamics. It is based on a European-built cabover chassis and a PACCAR van body.
KENWORTH unveiled a prototype-concept truck that integrates a European-style cabover chassis with its own van body to produce a Class 6 and 7 truck with enhanced aerodynamics.
“This has been tested, and I will tell you it has definitely shown fuel improvements over your standard box,” said Doug Powell, medium-duty marketing manager. “A lot of work has been done to prove this out, and a lot of real-world testing has been done to prove this out.”
It has a North American chassis with 34-inch frame-rail spacing, PACCAR PX-6 engine, Allison automatic transmission, Horz X-over exhaust, and five wheelbase options from 166 to 214 inches.
The frame rails will be 9⅞" × ¼" 120K steel, or 10¼" × ¼" 120K steel. It has a 45-gallon rectangular fuel tank located on the left side, with the 6.6-gallon rectangular DEF tank just behind it.
The cab has an 82.5"-wide interior space to cater to three people, and comes standard with an air-suspended driver's seat and a passenger bench seat with storage underneath.
Kenworth also has introduced NavPlus, which is now available for order on Kenworth Class 5-8 trucks.
NavPlus, a PACCAR proprietary navigation and business technology system, is standard on Kenworth steer clear of restricted roads and streets.
It.
NavPlus also offers audio controls (including satellite-enabled radio, AM/FM, CD, MP3 and USB), and camera inputs for up to four optional video cameras for monitoring the truck and trailer. An optional cellular modem allows drivers to connect to Sprint, which provides mobile connectivity services, meaning that means when the truck is parked and not in motion, the driver can access the Internet to look up favorite websites to search for loads, news and weather updates, and check personal email.
NavPlus and all of its features and benefits now are showcased on a special Kenworth NavPlus Website () that offers a six-minute video that explains and demonstrates how it works. The website's interactive feature enables fleet managers and drivers to discover the system's capabilities by clicking through the key menus and icons on the NavPlus system's dashboard screen.
The new website also includes a downloadable NavPlus online brochure, operating manual, Garmin navigation users guide, Sprint Broadband information and phone compatibility guide, and diagnostic guide.
Two other new products:
Neway ADZ rear suspension from SAF-Holland for heavy-duty and severe-duty applications.
“The big advantage is substantial weight reduction,” said Alan Fennimore, vocational marketing manager. “Neway was able to come back and take out almost 250 pounds per axle out of the suspension over the current axle.”
The ADZ suspension is for typical heavy-duty applications, such as construction trucks, loggers, and fire apparatus and emergency vehicles. The suspension also is for severe-duty applications where heavy vertical loads, high gross combination weights, high-torque drivetrains, high center of gravity loads, and significant off-road travel are expected.
Available in 23,000-pound and 26,000-pound. A new integral lower control arm module provides improved roll stability for high center-of-gravity load vehicles.
Kenworth is offering the Neway ADZ series suspension for the Kenworth C500, T440, T470, T800, and W900.
Fabco power take-off option on the two-speed transfer case for all-wheel drive Kenworth T270 Class 6 and T370 Class 7 models.
Kenworth says it is the first in the industry to offer a factory-installed PTO output drive on the transfer case on a medium-duty chassis.
It 3500 rpm.
The PACCAR van body includes a translucent roof. Note the slight curve to the roofline, a feature designed to smooth airflow.

2x01 Super-visor
February 3, 2011 10:30 pm
Tania's having a bad day. Darrel's living in the office, Gloria's winding her up, Asif's running away to Wales, Shelley's flat-hunting and Kenny's kissing strange girls and drawing pictures. The post room is in chaos and it's Tania's first appraisal as supervisor. Asif is so stressed that he enlists evil Charlie's help in convincing his family that he is a top lawyer. They want him to sue the optician who sold faulty glasses to his Auntie Reena. Can Tania pull it all together, pass her appraisal and get back on board the Kenny boat before it sails for good?
2x02 Monkey Love
February 10, 2011 10:30 pm.
2x03 Smoke and Mirrors
February 17, 2011 10:30 pm
Shelley wakes up in the office with the hangover from hell, annoys the other monkeys all day and smells terrible. Kenny and Tania's sex life is under scrutiny when Tania lets slip to Gloria that they didn't spend the previous night together and rumours fly through the office. Darrel's counter-espionage only makes things worse and his relationship advice for Asif, who has a crush on the office flower girl, isn't working. And there's a limo in Mike's personal parking space, so he's going up the wall.
2x04 Dream a Little Dream
February 24, 2011 10:30 pm
Kenny is back from a week on tour with the band for which he does photos and flyers. Tania has missed him, but Asif has missed him more. Tania has planned a motivational exercise involving hats and five-year life plans which puts the fear into Kenny. Is this it? Work, marriage, kids then death??
2x05 Who's the Daddy
March 3, 2011 10:30 pm
Darrel’s estranged dad, Pat turns up doing odd jobs at Fox Cranford. Pat soon spots an opportunity to find a new home at Darrel and Shelley’s flat having been kicked out by his ex. Shelley sees Pat for the unreliable self-obsessed tit that he is and verges on the point of violence. It’s a big day for Asif – if he passes his driving test he’s been promised a new set of wheels by his dad. And Kenny is stressed because everyone thinks he’s boring now he’s settled with Tania and sets out to prove them wrong.
2x06 Big Trouble in Little Cranford
March 10, 2011 10:30 pm
It’s Fox Cranford’s 30 year anniversary, but the celebration is a damp squib involving Gloria’s home made cake. Kenny’s panic stricken when he mistakenly thinks that Tania is pregnant, Mike’s on the verge of meltdown, the firm’s going under and the icy Miss Fox, a silent partner, is on the prowl - busting balls and sorting out the firm’s inefficiencies. Tania and Shelley decide to hold a proper party to cheer Mike up. Kenny’s in charge of the food and drink and with Darrel and Asif’s help it quickly goes pear-shaped. Will Mike top himself? Is Shelley pregnant? Or is it Tania?

5 Great things to do in Stockholm for free
There are only a few cities in the world that carry the historic pedigree of Stockholm, and certainly not very many this far north that have played such an important role in the evolution Europe. The earliest records of the name ‘Stockholm’ is from when the city was founded in 1252, but as far back as the 10th century a Norse settlement on the same spot called Agnafit was a major hub in the iron trade. Throughout the centuries the city has played a vital strategic role in the region, and today is one of Europe’s great cultural, political, financial and tourist hubs.
Of course, major European capitals are not known for being cheap to visit, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty you can do without spending much money. In fact, Stockholm is known for its beautiful architecture, clean air & water, and many municipal attractions that mean that there’s plenty to do even if you don’t want to spend a cent! Here are five things you can do in Stockholm for free that will still allow you to soak up the atmosphere, appreciate its beauty, and get to know the local culture a bit closer.

Militant group says such misuse of technology violates teaching of Islam, tribal customs. PHOTO: FILE
The pro-government militant faction led by commander Mullah Nazeer has banned mobile phones with built-in digital cameras and memory cards in Wana – a subdivision of South Waziristan tribal region which is believed to be a stronghold of the militant leader.
The announcement, which was made through loudspeakers from different mosques, also warned that any tribesman found in possession of such a cellphone would be fined Rs15,000 and his device would be confiscated.
Prayer leaders and clerics in different mosques have also been asked to spread awareness amongst tribesmen in their Friday sermons about the camera phone ban.
The reason provided for this ban is that the misuse of such mobiles violates the teachings of Islam and tribal customs. Indian and Pashto songs on these phones were cited as an example. The ban is also being used to justify protecting the honour and dignity of tribal women to ensure no videos of them are recorded in violation of the purdah system in the area. There is only one mobile network inside the Wana Scouts camp and the adjacent localities of Wana subdivision.
In the past, the Mullah Nazeer group set ablaze several camera phones in Wana Rustam Bazaar, and warned tribesmen to avoid using these kinds of technologies.
Militants in Swat
Earlier, in Swat, three Taliban fighters were killed in an ambush with security forces in the Sarsardarey village of Manglawar union council late Friday night.
Security forces raided the location where militants were hiding following a tip by local residents, according to Swat Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) spokesperson Col Zeeshan.
“Locals of the area informed security forces about some suspected militants in the area,” he said. “Following their tip-off the security forces cordoned off the area and raided the location, at which point militants opened fire on them. The security forces killed three militants,” the spokesperson told local media, adding that two short machine guns (SMGs), one pistol and ammunition were also recovered from the militants. He added said that the area has been cleared of the Taliban and there was no resistance from their side.
According to sources, the militants hail from an area located on the border of Buner district.
The new wave of target killing in the valley has resulted in the death of several peace committee members. As a result of the frequent attacks, security forces have beefed up their presence in sensitive areas and set up extra check points in those places as well.

Makes sense. Capturing images renders a Burqa useless, isn’t it and hence, against Islam. Camera Phones can be used to capture images ergo BAD!
Music is generally considered un-Islamic and hence, these phones which have the ability to play music are against Islam.
Taliban are always consistent and clear in their ideology.Recommend

The story of Arab, camel and his tent is being repeated in Wana and it might soon spread to whole of Pakistan for which military is entirely responsible for supporting certain factions of Taliban who are well known for switching their loyalties later and fight the state itself. No lessons have been learnt from the Swat experiment where Taliban antagonized and oppressed the people by enforcing dracunian laws and Mullah Nazir too is following the same pattern by banning cell phones which would soon be followed by many more restrictions.

What kind of ease does a camera-intact mobile bring to the already hardest lives of these tribesmen?

I too would be laughing at the absurdity of these laws made by the militants. But the truth of the matter is that they are directly affecting fellow Pakistanis ! When will we rid our land of such extremist fools who, for some reason, think that to be an Islamic society is equivalent to being a regressed society with no basic human rights, freedom of speech etc.

” The reason provided for this ban is that the misuse of such mobiles violates the teachings of Islam and tribal customs”
So the reason for the ban is misuse of mobile phones with camera. What about MISUSE OF RIFLES, SUICIDE BOMBERS & FORCE.? will such misuse be declared banned by them ? may we suggest them to USE THE BRAIN. We feel it is being MISUSED.
“The pro-government militant faction led by commander Mullah Nazeer has banned mobile phones with built-in digital cameras and memory cards in Wana’ — it is still in the memory that
all Militants were ONCE pro Government. ( till their ideology was supported ). With changed scenario their guns have been trained against the Government .

The College ��'. ?V- VOLUME V. No 1. BRYN MAWR, PA., OCTOBER 2, 1918 .<�� Pri�6 Cents I TWO OF FACULTY WED Dr. Clarence Ferree, Professor of Psy- chology, and Dr. Gertrude Rand, Associ- ate In Psychology, were married In New York last Saturday (September 28th). No engagement had been announced. ,W. B. M. PROFESSORS' AVIATION TEST IN USE ON WE8TERN FRONT Device Worked Out During Summer in Psychology Laboratory The government Is now using in France for the testing of aviators a piece of ap- paratus devised by Dr. Clarence Ferree and Dr. Gertrude Rand Ferree of the Bryn Mawr Psychology Department. The purpose of the test is to measure the speed of adjustment of the eye for clear seeing at different distances. Dr. Ferree's services were enlisted by the government last June when he was called to Camp Mlneola and asked to work out a test dur- ing the summer. An aviator needs a supernormal eye, Dr. Ferree said in sta'tlng the probfom. He must be able In one Instant to look off and see objects In the far distance and In the next to read clearly the figures on his dial plate. If his eye fails to adjust itself instantly to the change of focus, he is un- fit for aviation. Aces in France Often Unfit This facility of adjustment varies not only with different individuals, but from day to day. Aces in France are on some days unfit to make a flight. By means of Dr. Ferree's instrument such cases can be Instantly detected and consequent fa- talities avoided. The device will also be used in this country in the selection of aviators. Throughout his tests, which he made chiefly on the graduate students and the college farmers, Dr. Ferree found no one over thirty with the requisite speed of adjustment. His test has proved inci- dentally an excellent one for astigmatism. The apparatus may be seen in the Psy- chology Laboratory. Dr. Ferree was urged by Colonel Wil- iner, commanding officer of the Medical Research Laboratory at Camp Mlneola. to take a commission in the U. S. Service. Last week Dr. Ferree was called down to Washington and asked to devise an eye test for naval observers and signal men on battleships to determine the acuity of their eyes at low illumination.

always for the good guy...lawmanhowever the Rancher could go either way some good and some bad.outlaws are always the bad guys. ABreading4fun [at] gmail [dot] com
That's a tough question because all three could be great characters in the story. I'd say I don't have a preference, IF the outlaw was a changed man and wasn't a "bad" guy.
Hello, I prefer rancher...yep I am all about the good life, safe at home type... Gods land is a gift just like our life, so what we do with it is important ... just my opinion... I hope to read this book ...
I think I will pick The Rancher. He has so many options ~*~ unless, of course, The Rancher is a woman! That would be a good story!! Conversion, growth, and knowing God's Word is always true, by example and not so much by spoken word. The seeker being confirmed, settled in and strengthened; lives changed. Everyone can come out to the ranch ~*~ passer-bys, cook-out including town's-people, weddings, stray cattle, so many happenings!lanehillhouse[at]centurylink[dot]net
Hi, Rhonda! I enjoyed reading about you and your book. I haven't read a western romance before (but I'd love to do so), but I think the lawman would be my favorite hero.
It's a toss up between a lawman and a rancher. I'd probably lean slightly toward the lawman though.Your book sounds great! please enter me. kimberlyj503(at)gmail(dot)comThanks!
I just like a good christian hero. If an outlaw can turn his life around by becoming a hero, that makes things interesting.wfnren(at)aol(dot)com
First of all thank you for drawing my name for the Midwife book. I can't wait to read it, I will watch for your email. Second - I prefer the rancher in historical books, I think it is because of all the hard work they do and how dedicated they are to their family. Thank you for a chance to win another book.griperang at embarqmail dot com
In historical books I prefer the hero be a lawman. He can protect the heroine.
I prefer a lawman or an outlaw turned good! I enjoy historicals because they give you a chance to imagine what life was like at that time.jennydtipton[at]gmail[dot]com
Hi Everyone!! Sorry I'm late. I had jury duty this morning and well... let's just say I can now tell you what the inside of a judges chamber's looks like.I love all three. In this book Seth is a US Marshal. In Eliza's story coming in Feb. 2013 Jackson is a Blacksmith. And in Hannah's story, the one I'm working on now Daniel is a Rancher. As you can see, I like strong heros. Thank you all for coming by :)
I love it when an author takes a character with flaws and shows us readers how he/she can be changed once God is in control. The bigger the flaws, the more exciting the changes. So I would enjoy reading about an outlaw who becomes a strong Christian hero. I already have The Marshal's Promise in my TBR stack, so please draw someone else's name.
Hey Rhonda!Great interview! I prefer a rancher, but I'm a guy so probably doesn't matter as much. Always love anything you write!
I have to say I like Ranchers and Lawmen equally. The outlaws not so much. dancealert at aol dot com
My first choice for a hero is a Rancher...followed closely by a Lawman! Not crazy about an outlaw being a hero!Loved the interview and this post! Blessings!Judysweetpea.judy(at)yahoo(dot)com
Lawman, Rancher or a Blacksmith.richmond.abigail@gmail.com
Thanks everyone for stopping by. Trish thank you so much for having me, this has been really fun.Aw Aaron, thanks!Rhonda
Rhonda and Trish,Fun interview - I just won a copy of Short-straw Bride and I'm really looking forward to reading it.As far as a hero goes, I'm always intrigued by the outlaw, curious about the lawman, but give me the rancher, hands down. I think there's just something delicious about a man who loves wide, open spaces and doesn't mind spending time alone, a man who can build and repair anything, and who knows how to handle big animals. Strength, dignity, and doesn't feel like he has to prove it to anyone. Your book sounds wonderful - and I'm curious about your lawman :-). I'd love to win a copy!
I prefer an outlaw turned lawman. Thanks for the opportunity RO win!
I prefer when the hero is a lawman.This book sounds exciting.wildflowers386(at)yahoo(dot)com
Have no preference. I've read some with all those types of characters and enjoyed them greatly.Enter me please jrs362 at hotmail dot com
I guess I'm a sucker for a hero who has a second chance at life, a redeemed outlaw.:)worthy2bpraised at gmail dot com
Thanks for this chance to win this good sounding book. I would pick the Rancher as first choice. Maxie ( mac262@me.com )

US & World Summary: Congressional Dems Blast Bush (Washington, DC) -- Congressional Democrats are blasting President Bush for vetoing the war funding bill. Bush yesterday followed through on his promise to strike down the measure because it contained a timeline to withdrawal troops from Iraq. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress wont give Bush "a blank check" for Iraq. Despite the rhetoric, Bush and Congressional leaders will meet today at the White House to try to reach a compromise to provide funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. --- Immigration Rally Turnout Drops Drastically Immigration rights rallies across the country yesterday drew significantly smaller crowds than last years gatherings. The Phoenix rally drew about 15-thousand marchers, while about ten-thousand showed up in LA. Last year, the Los Angeles gathering drew about 500-thousand people. The LA rally turned violent after a brief confrontation between some protestors and police. After some protestors threw rocks and bottles at the officers, police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd. An unknown number of people were arrested. --- Corzine Pays Fine, Complaint Dropped (Trenton, NJ) -- New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine has voluntarily paid a fine for not wearing a seatbelt during last months crash that landed him in the hospital. According to authorities, the governors SUV was traveling 91-miles-an-hour when it crashed on April 12th. Corzine was thrown from the vehicle and suffered a broken leg, eleven busted ribs and other injuries. Because he paid the 46-dollar fine for the seatbelt infraction, a citizens complaint filed against Corzine for not wearing his seatbelt has been dropped. --- Study Suggests Racial Bias In NBA Referee Calls (New York, NY) -- NBA Commissioner David Stern is refuting a new study that claims calls made by the leagues referees are racially biased. According to the "New York Times," the University of Pennsylvania study looked at 13 seasons from 1991 to 2004, and claims that white refs called fouls at a greater rate against black players. Stern said the league did its own study after seeing a draft of the Pennsylvania study last year. The commissioner says the leagues review found that there is no bias. --- R. Kelly Pens Tribute To Virginia Tech Victims At least one singer is paying tribute to the victims and survivors of the recent mass shooting at Virginia Tech. R. Kelly has written a tribute to the victims of the massacre, entitled "Rise Up." According to Billboard.com, the song will be released through various digital services on May 15th, with the proceeds going to the Hokie Spirit Memorial fund.

The man filed a lawsuit yesterday against three Islamic groups who want to build the facility. According to the "South Florida Sun-Sentinel," Rodney Wright says the mosque would bring an extremist form of Islam to his Pompano Beach neighborhood and that it would be a nuisance that would decrease his property values. The Islamic Center plans to build a 29-thousand-400-square-foot worship center and school to replace an existing mosque. --- Britney Spears Performs At California Nightclub (Los Angeles, CA) -- Pop singer Britney Spears has performed publicly for the first time in more than three years.

WHAT A BASS! Competitive Fishing to Become Sanctioned KHSAA Sport
By: Michael C. Fehn
Updated: March 18, 2013
KHSAA Commissioner, Julian Tackett, announced Wednesday, Competitive Bass Fishing will be an officially sanctioned varsity sport beginning with the next school year. It will join bowling and competitive cheer as the newest additions.
"To say we are excited to sponsor bass fishing as a state championship sport-activity is an understatement," said Tackett. ", Tackett said.
Kentucky becomes the second state in the country to offer bass fishing as a high school sport. Illinois was the first. Competition will begin in the spring with a regular season, followed by a postseason and state championship in late April.
No word yet on whether any of the schools in our area plan to participate. But we'll keep fishing for that information. As soon as we get a bite, we'll reel you in. Sorry, couldn't resist.

Good question, I asked. Non-US TR6s received the Lucas mecahnical fuel injection system which, in the 1969-1970 models, was reputed to develop 150hp. The 1974 US-spec TR6 was quoted at 104hp. Direct comparisons are not really possible, because the methodology of quoting horsepower changed over the years. Through to the late 1960s, engines were placed on a engine dyno, and stripped of all auxillary items such as alternator, flywheel, water pump (cooling was provided by an independant pump), dry-sump lubrication, fan-forced cool air to the carburettor, no cooling fan, no air-cleaner, leaner jetting, and highly advanced timing, etc. By the early 70's, manufacturers were not allowed to be as liberal in estimating, but still the motors on the engine-dyno were not the same beasts as would be pushing around Mum's station-wagon.
The best measure of true horsepower and torque is to measure it at the rear wheels. This way a real-world estimate can be obtained.
My own TR6 is fairly stock; the engine has never been out of the car or worked on. It is a tired old donk with 80,000+ miles, so substantially less than the factory figures were to be expected. However, I have made some very simple and inexpensive modifications which I believe really helped; namely, K&N air filters, easy-breathing exhaust, Pertonix electronic ignition, electric cooling fan (ie, no mechanical fan), removal of all smog equipment, and carbs rebuilt and tuned by me.
The work was carried out by the helpful guys at the Dyno Shop in Santee, California (619/562-3933). Air temperature was 74F. I had the car tested at the same time as my Mates in the Pantera Club, and their big worked 351 Clevelands were pulling 300-450 rwhp (rear-wheel horsepower). Their runs on the chassis-dyno took only seconds. When time came to dyno the TR6, the run seemed to take forever, but everyone remarked at what a gorgeous exhaust note the 6 had. Some fellows likened it to an older V12 Ferrari, or maybe half a Ferrari!
The results of 91 rwhp at 5,000rpm and 123ft-lbs at 2850rpm are pretty impressive for an essentially stock and tired motor. What does this equate to in the real world? At the drag strip, my TR6 will dispatch equally tired Datsun 240Zs and early Mazda Miatas. I'm happy with that.

DERBY NOTES.
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).
The rains have come only just in time to save thousands of head of dying cattle. A few weeks longer delay and Kimberley would have lost stock to such a serious extent that years must have elapsed before its regaining a flourishing condition. As it is many thousands of cattle and sheep
have been lost. On all stations there has been loss. Some, however, have not suffered severely, whilst others have re- ceived a blow that will take a year or two to recover. Obogamma station is one of the favoured few. The losses there do not exceed 200 bead. The Yeeda station loss
is estimated at 500 to 600. The Gogo and Fossil Downs stations lost very heavily,
but no accurate figures are to hand. Kim- berley Downs station, or Balmaningarra as it was called until recently, had no loss over the average. The same can be said of the Barker River station. The losses
will be felt chiefly at shearing time up the Fitzroy, and until then no accurate esti- mate can be made, although it is known that many suffered heavily. In some parts
10 to 15 inches of rain have fallen within the last four weeks. In Derby we have had about 7 Inches since January 1st.

: Resentment
RESISTING RESENTMENT
This mother is wrestling with an insidious infection to relationships: resentment. Resentment results from being injured or insulted by someone. It is the negative response to being hurt. This devastating emotion often slithers into our souls unnoticed. We might respond in anger or sorrow initially and then “get over it” – so we think. A close cousin to the more hostile attitude of bitterness, resentment can hide in the crevices of the soul and go undetected as it poisons us.

For the radical Left, any Jew murdered in the name support for the Palestinians, had to have it coming.
Vasarahammer finds an interesting comment to a thread at the Hommaforum website concerning the brutal murders of the Rabbi and his family. the comment comes from a Finnish ‘lefty’ who also happens to work in a Swedish speaking daycare facility in Finland no less, who doesn’t agree that the cold blooded murders of the Rabbi and his children were acts of Jew-hatred (read = anti-Semitism).
H/T: Vasarahammer:
“He (Veini) says that Toulouse killer did not commit a racist hatecrime, because he wanted to avenge for the dead Palestinians (and not kill Jews because they were Jews). Therefore, his actions were politically and not racially motivated.It’s quite amazing how some people manage to perform such intellectual somersaults.”
NOTE: How would you like for this amoral jerk to work around your kids at a daycare? It’s totally unbelievable the kinds of crackpots and miscreants that inhabit the same breathing space as you or I, let alone access to your children.
Frida Ghitis:.
Europe’s blind spot on anti-Semitism
.
H/T: LLM
It is beyond me that someone who works at a DAYCARE can say such things! How is it possible for people to even think those things? The girl tried to run away, got pulled back by her hair by him and was shot in the head. How is the murder of little kids in any way political? To what extent would it affect his ‘political goals’?
Pretty sick stuff. It’s a real sicko mind that hang on to such thoughts like that.

An intimate group of cast members, industry execs and celebrity guests showed up to the premiere party for Sony Pictures Classics dramedy Celeste and Jesse Forever at FigOly Restaurant on Thursday evening in Los Angeles.
“I’m so pleased with it. It’s like the dream version of what we wrote,” said actor Will McCormack, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rashida Jones.
STORY: Andy Samberg Gets Divorced in 'Celeste and Jesse Forever' Trailer
For Jones, the story -- about two high school sweethearts who marry and decide to divorce while remaining friends -- struck close to home.
“It is a kind of amalgam of a lot of relationships that Will and I were seeing around us and obviously personal experiences we’ve had in our past,” said Jones. “We felt like it was enough of a phenomenon amongst our friends to write about.”
Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker mingled with guests as Jones and her parents Peggy Lipton and Quincy Jones sipped on Love on the Rocks cocktails. “It’s very reminiscent of great American romantic comedies like Annie Hall or When Harry Met Sally,” said Barker. “But the difference is, it’s from a female point of view which makes it rich, modern, new and fresh.”
STORY: Sundance 2012: 'Celeste and Jesse Forever' Sells to Sony Pictures Classics
Andy Samberg, who spent the night catching up with his brother and friends at a corner table, was excited about his departure from comedic films and into a more dramatic role.
“A lot of people think of me as just a comedy [actor] — that’s kind of all I really wanted to do up until this point,” he said. “But I read the script and really liked it. I’m friends with Rashida and I asked her if she’d ever consider me for it, and it worked out.”
Celeste and Jesse Forever hits theatres in New York and Los Angeles on Aug. 3.

I have defamed the Tooth Fairy.
Since the girls were little bitty, we’ve brushed their teeth. At first we used a soft silicone brush that they couldn’t impale themselves on. (We tried one of those impale-able ones first, and the girls insisted on grabbing them, and we could see the potential for injury, so we switched to the silicone ones.) Then after a while, the girls insisted on brushing themselves, with Mama and Dada doing a follow-up to get any missed spots.
But now they are growing and not so docile (if they ever were!) and insist on doing it themselves. We’ve now graduated to regular toddler brushes, so we supervise closely. The only problem is, they miss a heck of a lot of spots.
Zanna doesn’t mind us going over her teeth afterwards, but Halle passionately detests it. So how do I explain that she’d like it even less when the dentist has to fill her cavities, or worse, has to pull out her teeth? And not have her be a screaming wreck at her next dentist appointment, even if her teeth are fine?
So I dragged the Tooth Fairy’s good name through the mud.
Since they seem to be ok with the existence of the Garbage Fairy (that’s the one that lives in garbage cans and takes offerings in her ‘in-box’, and all dropped food on the floor is her rightful due, as well.) I told them that the Tooth Fairy is attracted to dirty teeth. She likes to take dirty teeth and that would be “Owie”. So that is why we have to do a good job brushing, so Halle will be safe and the Tooth Fairy will stay away.
We weren’t making much progress with that, until I took the girls on a shopping trip to our local Target store. It’s six weeks before Halloween and the shelves there are now full of related products. As we were wheeling our cart past, we must have set off a motion sensor, because suddenly a 6ft tall witch came to life, cackeling and scaring the daylights out of all of us. As I beat a hasty retreat with my girls, I had the presence of mind to say “THAT’S the Tooth Fairy! And she’s going to take your teeth if you don’t brush very well!.”
The girls were quite shaken after that encounter, but shook it off soon after. After that, though, Halle, while still protesting, allows us to do a final go-over with the tooth brush, to make sure there’s nothing left to attract that nasty Tooth Fairy!
I don’t like scaring the girls, but in this case, it’s not something that we can just wait until they’re older to get through to them. I really don’t think they’d handle well, being strapped down an administered a hypo and having the dentist work their teeth over with his drill.
Lesser of the two evils, I guess.

Hi all. I'm writing a simple image archive program. The program is for indexing a whole lot of pictures we sell on a CD. The focus of the product is on the pictures, not the viewer, so it's pretty simple; it just shows the pictures, sorted by category's, resizes them to whatever size the user wants (with imagemagick), and searches though the collection. Right now, the program is using a Twisted webserver in the backend. All the pages are dynamic, based off one template file. The gui is a very simple Venster (venster.sf.net) frontend, mainly consisting of a web browser control, and some code to open a file-save dialog when the user clicks save to save a picture. I'm wondering if there is a better way to do this. Perhaps twisted is a bit too much for all of this? Another problem is when Twisted opens up the server port, firewalls start complaining. Perhaps there is a better way.

Hello all, The past few years have seen the Twisted sprint at PyCon grow to a very impressive size. With expectations that this will be the largest PyCon yet, I have no reason to expect that the trend will be reversed this year. I have "run" the sprint for the past two years, though in practice there are not many duties associated with that post. This year, I need to hand off that responsibility to someone else, as I will only be attending the sprints for the first day. "Running" a PyCon sprint involves interfacing with the PyCon organizers to get a room assignment. Beyond that, all that's really necessary is to keep your eyes open for things that might be impeding the work of sprinters (yourself included, as these duties should not take up more than about 2% of your time). If you're interested in taking this on, please let me know. Let me know which days you'll be attending the sprints (preferably you'll be attending all days, but missing the last day or two might not disqualify you). Thanks! Jean-Paul

It’s that time of the year and it’s coming up fast. If you haven’t marked you calendar yet, we will be changing our clocks back from Daylight Saving Time on November 4th this year. This is the perfect time to ensure your family’s safety throughout the next year by changing out the batteries in your smoke detectors and emergency flashlights. Keep your loved ones safe by making this yearly practice suggested by the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), a tradition in your home.
Did you know that “Thirty-eight percent of fatal fire injuries occur in homes with no smoke alarms, while 24 percent occur in homes in which at least one smoke alarm is present but fails to operate, frequently due to dead or missing batteries”.(Fire Analysis and Research Division of the National Fire Protection Association).
I moved into my home over 12 years ago and never put much thought to the smoke detector up until last year when I heard all over the news “Change your batteries”. I got my little step latter out and wanted to check my alarms, all worked perfect. I walked away, till a few days later. I started to think. I was in that house for 12+ years and those batteries are still working strong? How in the world could that be? I walked back up to the smoke detectors, just to find out that someone, prior to us moving in, had hard wired all the smoke detectors in the house. How stupid (excuse my French) was that?
I added battery operated Smoke detectors to the house, now we are doubled up on the alarms and I feel so much better with the kids in the house, knowing that they are safe in case of an emergency.
From now through November 4th, visit the Energizer Bunny®Facebook page and click on the Fire Safety Info Tab, to be entered into a daily drawing for a deluxe Family Safety Kit valued at $150. While you are on the Facebook page, check out the fire safety tips, downloadable family home escape plan and children’s pintables.

Arson and other uncontrolled wildland fires pose a serious threat to lives, property, and natural resources in rural and suburban communities. Conditions are particularly hazardous in the wildland urban interface (WUI), where structures and other human developments meet, or intermingle, with forests and grasslands. Nationally, the damage associated with wildland arson, acreage and dollar losses, is more than all other causes associated with wildland fires.
Since its inception in 1915, one of the primary missions of TFS has been to enforce all laws pertaining to the protection of forests and woodlands and prosecute violations of those laws. To accomplish this, the TFS Director may appoint up to 25 employees who are commisioned state peace officers licensed and certified by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education to fulfill those duties.
One of the primary roles of a TFS law enforcement (LE) officer is to provide wildfire arson investigation and training as requested by TFS personnel, local fire departments, the State Fire Marshal’s Office or other law enforcement agencies. TFS LE officers work both misdemeanor and felony investigations. The department also maintains an arson hotline to enable reporting of suspected wildland arson.
LE officers also work felony and misdemeanor timber theft cases as well as serving as subject matter experts for other state or local law enforcement units. The agency maintains a Timber Theft Hotline to allow public reporting of suspected timber theft activity.
TFS LE officers also provide:

More controversy over Nativity scene
BY BETTY WATERS
blw@tylerpaper.com
blw@tylerpaper.com
ATHENS--Patrick Greene, of San Antonio, is seeking to have a sign put up stating that two Texas atheists gave a star for the nativity scene that will be on the Henderson County Courthouse lawn in December.
He has indicated that he would file a lawsuit against the county if the sign is not erected, Clint Davis, county attorney, said Tuesday.
Greene submitted his request via email late last week to county Judge Richard Sanders' secretary.
Sanders said Tuesday that Greene will have to file formal application before a decision on the request is made. The judge has authority under county policies to act on the matter.
As soon as he receives a formal application, Sanders said he will rule quickly ... "within one day" ... and direct the county attorney to notify Greene.
The judge has turned the handling of correspondence between the county and Greene over to the county attorney.
Historically, the county has not allowed banners with any type of writing on the courthouse lawn, Sanders said.
The attorney said, "I don't speak for Judge Sanders, but I think it would be unlikely that we would approve any request for any type of signage or banner to be placed on the county courthouse (lawn)."
Davis noted that the judge recently denied a request from the Freedom From Religion Foundation to put up its banner.
"It would be difficult for us to then turn around and allow him (Greene) to put out his banner or sign," Davis said.
Davis said he conveyed to Greene that he is welcome to formally make his request using the county's application form, but that there are no other decorations that include signs or banners or wording or things such as that in the Christmas decorations.
On Monday, the attorney sent Greene a copy of the county's premises use policy and the application form that everyone who wants to put anything on the courthouse lawn must use.
"We will just wait on him and see what he does next," Davis said.
Attempts by the Tyler Morning Telegraph to reach Greene by phone for comment Tuesday were unsuccessful.
Greene sent the star last March and added the sign stipulation last week. Giving the star "was a wonderful gesture but he has put a dark shadow over that gesture," Carol Morton, executive director, Keep Athens Beautiful, said.
KAB's Light Up Athens Committee has been authorized to put up Christmas decorations on the courthouse lawn for years.
"Per our agreement with the county, we cannot put signage up on the courthouse (lawn)," Ms. Morton said. "The committee will be meeting later, and we will be discussing whether or not we will use the star and what we are going to do with the star."
Greene first threatened a lawsuit last Christmas in an attempt to have the nativity scene removed. Controversy swirled over the nativity scene also because the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation demanded it be removed and later sought to erect an anti-religion banner.
At that time, Greene described himself as an atheist. Last spring, Greene said in interviews with the news media that he converted to Christianity after Christians in Henderson County sent donations to help with expenses he incurred for a medical problem with his eye sight.
However, a San Antonio Express-News article from May reported Greene said he had returned to atheism.
In correspondence he sent the county within the last week, Greene said he and his wife contributed a star for the nativity scene because he had noticed last year that it did not have one.
His email told county officials, "Because the Freedom From Religion Foundation gave you so much trouble with wanting their insulting sign put up, my wife and I would like the KAB Committee to place a sign near the star stating that two atheists contributed the star because of the generosity of the Christians of Athens."

East Texans inspire with health, fitness stories
BY COSHANDRA DILLARD
cdillard@tylerpaper.com
cdillard@tylerpaper.com
Fitness was booming in East Texas throughout 2012. In these pages each Sunday, local health and fitness enthusiasts, as well as residents who are figuring it out as they go, have inspired readers to create new lifestyle habits and taught them that it's never too late to make a change.
These are the top 10.
1. Bob Moore:
At 80 years old, Bob Moore doesn't miss a day of walking and has inspired Canton city officials to create healthy living initiatives. Moore also led the effort to draw up a resolution to have the Texas Legislature recognize the small city as the "walking capital of Texas."
2. Vanessa Pearson:
In one year, the Tyler Morning Telegraph copy editor dropped 100 pounds after participating in the company's wellness challenges. Not only did she adopt healthy eating habits and commit to regular exercise, but she also inspired co-workers by sharing her journey and providing encouragement.
3. Abbie Halberstadt:
A fitness instructor, Mrs. Halberstadt led a Body Pump class until around her 37th week of pregnancy -- with twins. Within weeks of giving birth, she was back at the gym, with the healthy babies in tow.
4. Harold Wilson:
For the past 26 years, 79-year-old Wilson enjoyed running marathons and has set his sights on the 2013 Boston Marathon. He started running after his doctor advised him to lose weight and to lower his cholesterol level.
5. Sandra Baker:
In July, the 49-year-old mother of two competed in a bodybuilding contest for the first time. To prepare, Mrs. Baker worked out four days a week for up to 90 minutes, usually in the mornings. Although a crowd favorite, she didn't place in the show, but her confidence was boosted and she pledged to continue competing in body building contests.
6. Fire Station No. 9:
A group of firefighters were motivated to make a change following potential health crises and after watching p opular documentaries on the state of America's health, including "Forks Over Knives." Wes Malcolm, 34, started eating better quality foods and reduced his meat intake while Bob Moon, 48, became a vegan. Zach Houston, 34, and Matthew Houk, 46, also have been dedicated to eating clean and making better lifestyle choices.
7. Tyler Senior Center's dancers:
People at the center participate in Texercise, a statewide exercise program developed for older adults, and line dancing. Most are regular participants whose love of dance -- and life -- inspire others to get up and move while having fun.
8. Candace Harmon and Jerry Fincher:
A chance meeting in 2008 led to a partnership between the pair, who both enter bodybuilding competitions. Mrs. Harmon, 38, and Fincher, 67, have both been successful and rely on each other for accountability.
9. Lindsay Gray:
The fitness instructor and Whitehouse resident's life changed after suffering traumatic injuries to her brain and face. She was in the hospital for 20 days -- 16 of which she was in a medically induced coma. Her face was crushed and she underwent two facial reconstructive surgeries. Seventy-five percent of her face is covered in titanium plates today. She feels blessed to have recovered with hardly any visible signs of the crash and has since committed to a life of health and fitness.
10. Heather Garland:
Ms. Garland avoids excuses and has become an avid exerciser. She's a single mom and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a teenager. She's lost about 50 pounds over the years after adopting a healthier lifestyle, which includes fresh fruits, vegetables and lots of exercise.

*The Exposure Trifecta. Or, how to shoot on Manual.
Have you ever taken a photo where your subject looks like a deer in the headlights from the flash while the ambiance in the scene behind them fades quickly to a black abyss? Or, you try to catch your child scurrying around the house and no matter what you do, the picture turns out as a blurred mess? This post is being written to help those (mainly my mom) who’ve asked me “how do you do that?” when they see a picture that avoids some of the common frustrating problems. Whether it be a selective focus, blurred action to accentuate movement or an image that is intentionally over or underexposed, the key to photography is understanding the three main components of proper exposure control. Hold on to your hat, I am going to help get you off of the ‘auto everything box’ and manipulating your own exposure in no time.

Le Figaro (Paris) reported Friday that a French-organized international military intervention in northern Mali is in the works. -- The government of François Hollande, pushing hard on the matter, is letting it be known that it is "only a matter of weeks" before its first phase is engaged, with the impending rainy season in Mali adding urgency to the situation. -- Paris, however, which "claims to be breaking with past 'Françafrique' practices" and "doesn't want to hear once again about its colonial past," is "refusing to be on the front line," Isabelle Lasserre said. -- And major difficulties have not been resolved, a meeting of the Support and Follow-up Group on Mali in Bamako showed on Friday: for the time being "the situation appears deadlocked both because of confusion over the sharing of power in Bamako after the March putsch and because of international disagreements over whether it is a good idea to engage in dialogue with the rebels before using force." -- And the U.S. is playing a larger role than originally expected: ." ...

HOW FRANCE IS PLANNING INTERVENTION IN MALI'S NORTH
By Isabelle Lasserre
** The plan's first phase should be launched in November -- Paris will not send ground troops **
Le Figaro (Paris)
October 19, 2012
It's "only a matter of weeks" before a military operation gets underway that is intended to reconquer the north of Mali, occupied by Islamist groups linked to al-Qaeda, according to French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The U.N. Security Council has given 45 days to West African countries to propose a concrete intervention plan. Urged on by France, the European Union will propose in the same timeframe a plan to manage the crisis. After that, the way ahead will be clear. "If we botch the meteorologial window, we'll have to wait for a year," warns one well-informed source. Everything should be engaged on a wide front before the end of March, when the rainy season begins. Concretely, Jean-Yves Le Drian's entourage is talking about a three-phase program: first, stabilize the south of Mali and protect Bamako by the end of November; second, put in place the formation of African armies in January; third, start the reconquest of the north by the beginning of March at the latest.
Officially, it's the African armies that will lead the operation. Although it has been designated as the principal enemy by AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb), Paris, which claims to be breaking with past "Françafrique" practices and doesn't want to hear once again about its colonial past, is refusing to be on the front line. France, hiding behind Europe and positioning itself as the support of African countries that will be assisted in planning and logistics, promises that there will "not be ground troops."
THREE THOUSAND MEN
The French authorities are communicating more discreetly about special forces at work in the region, whose mission is independent of the official calendar. They are preparing to intervene upstream in order to provide intelligence and guide the African forces on the ground. They could act more quickly still if France's interests or the life of the hostages come to be threatened.
As in Libya and in Côte d'Ivoire in 2011, covert means are positioned to provide support to local forces, in particular the Malian army, which is under-equipped and demoralized after its defeat by the Islamists. Behind the scenes, Paris has also taken charge of drawing up the intervention program that is supposed to be proposed by the West African countries..
All the details of the military operation have not yet been worked out. The African countries are expected to furnish 3,000 men, but the list of states participating in the intervention against Isalmist fighters armed with missile- and rocket-launchers has not yet been finalized. Nor have the political rules. But all the potential countries are well aware: without a lasting diplomatic solution, military intervention will not be sufficient to settle the problem of AQIM in the Sahel.
[INSET: THE MALIAN CONFLICT. AT STAKE IN THE CONFLICT: Northern Mali and cities under the control of Islamists and Tuaregs. Zone of AQIM's activity. TOWARD AN INTERVENTION? Member countries of CEDEAO [Communauté économique des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest ('Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] [ ]) [Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Niger]. Non CEdEAO-member country that may intervene [Chad]. Countries opposed to intervention [Mauritania, Algeria]. Presence of French military.]
MILITARY RECONQUEST UNDER DISCUSSION IN BAMAKO
The Malian interim president, Dioncounda Traoré, emphasized on Friday the "urgency" of a foreign armed intervention to liberate the north of his country when he opened the international meeting in the Malian capital whose goal was to hasten such an intervention.
"We shouldn't lose even a second. This is an emergency, we're in a race against the clock," said Dioncounda Traoré to high international officials gathered to harmonize their positions before sending a West African U.N.-supported force into the north of Mali.
The U.N. and the African Union have announced, for their part, the opening of permanent offices in Bamako in order to coordinate their respective actions in this crisis. But there are still divergences between West African officials and the representatives of the international organizations regarding what is needed for the deployment of the African force if it is to participate in a military initiative in the part of Mali controlled by al-Qaeda and its allies.
Given the extent to which the situation appears deadlocked both because of confusion over the sharing of power in Bamako after the March putsch and because of international disagreements over whether it is a good idea to engage in dialogue with the rebels before using force, this meeting of the Support and Follow-up Group on Mali is not expected to result in any spectacular progress.

Dustin Hopkins took advantage of the 11 Florida State scoring drives to work on perfecting his kicks based on a host of new rules. The senior said it takes a little adjusting to, but that the new rules don't make kicking off much different.
New rules move kickoffs to the 35-yard line and bring touchbacks up to the 25-yard line. The kickoff coverage team can no longer take off to a running start. Coach Jimbo Fisher says the rules were put into effect to decrease significant kickoff return injuries. But he's not sure that they haven't backfired.
"I said to myself, I don't know, this might be more physical than not." Fisher said.
"I think they did it trying to eliminate [more] returns," Fisher said. "But I think they might have enhanced the problem because I think you're going to get more big bodies flying in shorter areas now [in terms of] collisions. I think there are going to be more [because of] less space."
Fisher doesn't think the new rules affect FSU adversely.
"The type of athletes we have, I think if we hit the ball right and do what we're supposed to do, I think it can be an advantage for us," Fisher said.
In the Murray State game, several of Hopkins' kicks soared high into the hair, gathering plenty of hang time before eventually landing in 10-yard line. FSU's kickoff coverage team was already there, ready to use their size and speed to swallow up the defender.
Of Hopkins' 12 kickoffs during the game, five went for touchbacks. The other seven that were returned for an average of just 16 yards. Murray State was pinned behind their own 25-yard line on six kickoffs.
"Our coverage team is so fast and athletic, every time we tried to put one in the 10-yard line, they were right there," Hopkins said. "Running down quick and they helped make me look pretty good. I'm lucky to have those guys running down."
FSU didn't always abide by the theory of putting your biggest, fastest guys on kick coverage, but they have since Fisher has been around. He believes it can drastically change momentum of the game and give Florida State a leg up on their competition.
"Those body types in special teams - which we have a lot of - the Christian Jones type, Telvin [Smith], Toshman [Stevens], Kelvin Benjamin, Nick Moody types, Nigel Bradham - those big physical guys give you such an advantage [on special teams]," Fisher said.
Those players take pride in their special teams work, and cornerback Nick Waisome, who works on second team punt coverage said it is a matter of being the best.
"It's definitely a pride thing. Coach Gran is hard on special teams here, he wants us to be number one in everything," Waisome said. "He definitely stresses it and we take it as a serious matter whenever we go on kickoff. He's always like, we have to be number one, so that's what we shoot for."
Hopkins said that he has not game-planned further out that Savannah State, but that his kicking philosophy will likely only change if the other team fields a great kick returner. With the coverage team that he has on his side, he's not worried.
"It gives me so much confidence, because I know that even if I don't get a great kick, the chances of the other team getting a great return is hopefully pretty slim given the people I have next to me."
'Noles support Team Fleetwood
EJ Manuel took a deep breath and then another. He asked for the media, and for those watching his Monday morning press conference to support the Team Fleetwood facebook page, since he was unable to tweet and spread the word.
Manuel became emotional while talking about a recent visit he and Dustin Hopkins took to see 17-year-old Austin Fleetwood, a Wakulla teen who had been battling cancer.
"It was
just
"
Manuel couldn't finish the sentence. He had run out of words and shook his head back and forth.
Hopkins and Manuel went to Fleetwood's house on Sunday afternoon to visit the teen and bring him autographed FSU jerseys and gear. Fleetwood had wanted to come to the Murray State game the day before, but wasn't up to it.
Manuel said the teen was thrilled with the gear and the visit touched both he and Hopkins and helped put things in perspective for them.
"It definitely puts things in perspective - how unimportant football is and how important football is," Hopkins said. "The unimportance being that the beauty of life is just so much more significant than a game
And then I see the importance of football, in that the hope it can give people, just being able to relate to somebody on that level."
Austin Fleetwood passed away on Monday morning, not even 24 hours after the visit from Manuel and Hopkins.
"Being able to see him, I've never experienced something like that," Manuel said. "Luckily my parents and my sister were still here because I couldn't help but cry this morning when I [found out]."
Sadness tinged their memory now, but the visit itself was a happy one.
"Man, you can just see the smile on his face. I can't forget it," Manuel said.
Manuel and Hopkins won't soon forget the visit and both plan on wearing the red and black Team Fleetwood bands around their wrists for the rest of the season.
Waisome ready for bigger challenge
Nerves are par for course and Nick Waisome felt a little bit nervous running out of the tunnel and onto Bobby Bowden field for the first time as a starter.
It was different, he said, but he definitely liked the feeling.
"Little bit of nerves in the beginning, but after that first play, everything else goes away and it's just football," Waisome said.
Waisome, who made a tackle on Saturday night, was happy with the way he went out and performed for the first time on the big stage. He wished Murray State threw the ball more, but stayed on his toes throughout the game and worked on his technique so that he can be ready for teams that do throw more.
He's already looking forward to Savannah State and hoping that their offense throws the ball more.
"They know we're a pretty strong defense, I mean, I don't know if they would throw it on us a lot, but hopefully they do," Waisome said.
Waisome was prepared to see more action at field corner because opponents sometimes try to avoid challenging Xavier Rhodes, who is opposite Waisome at boundary corner.
"I thought I was going to get a little bit of action, but I'd watch and they'd give him one and they wouldn't give me anything," Waisome said with a laugh. "They did throw one time [to me], but it was a pretty good game."

Perhaps it isn't fair to post this particular cape buffalo on Ugly Overload. Afterall, his looks come from a long and hard life on the African savannah (check out those nitched ears!). Though, when you poke around online, you quickly come to understand that the merit of this animal doesn't come from their looks.
Although they are herbivores, they are known to be very aggressive. These beasts are believed to have killed more big game hunters than any other animal in Africa. They can take down lions, who only bother attacking sick or old individuals. If wounded, they have been reputed to have stalked and then attacked the foolish man who shot him. When they decide to throw their weight around - nearly one ton of muscle, bone, and horns - they are lethal.
The cape buffalo may not have any brains underneath those gnarly horns, but I'll respect it just the same. From a distance. Behind a strong fence.
Thanks for the photo, Vearl.

Lexington Virginia Music Festival
Upriver brings a show for the whole family that is an educational and a step back in time to the the Appalachian Mountains with Bluegrass, Folk, and Celtic Music to the Lime Kiln stage on on Sunday, July 24, 2011.
Upriver includes Dan Moorefield, with musical roots that stem back to Ireland, is featured on vocals, fiddle, guitar, and piano. Dan has a Masters degree in Education and provides not only entertaining music but also local history during his shows. Teresa Morrison adds a large amount of variety to the group as a talented artist on a multitude of instruments including the Irish tin whistle, alto recorder, tenor banjo, mandolin, bouzouki, and guitars. Both Teresa and Dan are committed to music education and Scots Irish heritage.
The band is occasionally joined by Myra Morrison. Myra is featured on fiddle, piano, and vocals. She is an award winning fiddle player and, like Teresa, teaches music at the Wayne Center of the arts. Their larger band adds an upright bass. The four piece band is used for large venues, festivals, large concerts, and dances.
Upriver is committed to education through music. They are active with music based enrichment and educational youth programs with activities to expose children to a variety of instruments, history, and culture. The group specializes in playing entertaining music while weaving in stories to tell how it came to be an integral part of our local culture. The performing artists and education specialists pride themselves on their goal to provide the audience with an experience that will thrill and entertain musically, and educate and enrich through oral tradition.
Upriver’s fifteen track album ‘Together This Time,’ features original music and old time favorites. The album contains a haunting rendition of the Appalachian classic ‘Shenandoah.’ This is music that is rarely heard on radio or television. It is tradition and legacy of rural American music that has been passed down through generations. The music is reminiscent of a time before technology when musicians were counted upon to provide entertainment were held in high esteem in the community.
This show is a wonderful event for families because of the focus and the artists' background in education. The concert on will be sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank and the gates and concessions will open at 6:00 pm and the show will begin at 7:30 pm.

One Direction aren't solely admired by teenage girls or dare we say it, older women too, even Hollywood A-listers are captivated by their charm with the boy's latest celebrity fan being Colin Farrell.
At last night's Total Recall premiere in Leicester Square omg! spoke to the star of the movie, Colin Farrell who initially stunned us by introducing himself (as if we didn't know who HE was).
[Related story: Colin Farrell on kissing Kate Beckinsale]
[Related story: Niall Horan tweets joy at having just 6 months with braces on]
Once we'd calmed down we asked if he was proud of fellow Irish fittie One Direction's Niall Horan…
Colin told us: "Yeah sure, I'm proud of anyone that puts anywhere on the map can I be so un-nationalistic?
"I'm proud of all my fellow country men and women, I do love the place I come from even if I'm not there as much as I'd like to. Yes [I'm proud of] Horan absolutely."
Colin Farrell praised Niall Horan. Copyright [Wenn]
Bless, we now await Niall's reaction to this…
Another famous face Colin spoke about was his Total Recall predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger who Mr (fittie) Farrell described as: "He had me by about six inches and 120 pounds on me."
Hehehe we're not sure those six inches matter when you're as fit as Colin.
And if his humourous side doesn't do it for you, the mocking of himself over his female fans certainly will.
After asking the star if he thought the movie would reward him with even more female fans he mockingly yawned saying: "I have more [female fans]? I couldn't possibly have any more!
"I just enjoy doing what I do anytime anyone comes out man, woman, dog, child, birds - I'm just grateful for it all."
And we are grateful for having you in celebsville too Mr C!

Last night Jennifer Aniston looked stunning in a red Valentino dress as she arrived at the Oscars.
Jennifer Aniston revealed that she chose her dress because it was loo friendly. Copyright [Getty]
Not an easy colour to pull off when it has the potential to violently clash with the carpet.
However, unlike many other actresses who walked the red carpet last night, the 44-year-old admitted that she her decision to wear the dress had nothing to do with fashion.
Instead, Jen’s decision was based on a more practical aspect.
She told People magazine: "It fits, it's comfortable and it's easy to pee in. You just lift, hoist and do a couple squats!"
Yes that’s right, Jennifer Aniston chooses her award season gowns based on how easy it is to go to the toilet in them.
Smart girl if you ask us.
The couple sparked pregnancy speculation last night. Copyright [Getty]
The actress was joined on the red carpet by her fiancé Justin Theroux, with the two prompting speculation that Jen may be expecting a baby.
As the couple posed together for the cameras, Justin was seen stroking Jen’s stomach.
So either she had an upset belly or a mini Jen could be on the way.
The two are also rumored to be getting wed in as little as a matter of weeks after sources reported that the couple had had wedding bands delivered to their house.
Well at least we now have an inkling as to what Jennifer’s wedding dress will be like.
Toilet friendly.

Hopes fading for climate agreement
BONN, Germany |
BONN, Germany (Reuters) - "Ask for a camel when you expect to get a goat," runs a Somali saying that sums up the fading of ambitions for United Nations talks on slowing climate change -- aim high, but settle for far less.
Developing nations publicly insist the rich must agree far deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, but increasingly believe that only a weaker deal can actually be achieved to keep the existing Kyoto Protocol, or parts of it, alive beyond 2012.
"They have to ask for a camel ... but will settle for a goat," Mohamed Adow, of Christian Aid, said of poor nations' strategy at a just-ended session of 180 nations in Bonn.
Hopes for a treaty.
At issue now is what can be salvaged from the talks.
"This process is dead in the water," said Yvo de Boer, the former head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat who stepped down last year to work at KPMG, a consultancy and auditing firm.
"It's not going anywhere," he said during the June 6-17 talks in Bonn among negotiators trying to avert more heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising sea levels.
Disputes between rich and poor on sharing curbs in greenhouse gases mean gridlock over the Kyoto Protocol, the existing U.N. plan which obliges about 40)

But Witty said the $1 billion price tag was "one of the great myths of the industry", since it was an average figure that includes money spent on drugs that ultimately fail.
In the case of GSK, a major revamp in the way research is conducted means the rate of return on R&D investment has increased by about 30 percent in the past three or four years because fewer drugs have flopped in late-stage testing, he said.
"If you stop failing so often you massively reduce the cost of drug development ... it's why we are beginning to be able to price lower," Witty said.
"It's entirely achievable that we can improve the efficiency of the industry and pass that forward in terms of reduced prices.".

HistoryEdit
Ultraman CosmosEditGelworm was a monster whom had lived its life on a tiny meteor with its mate. When the gelworms were separated, The mate was trapped on the meteor, which was then transferred to a university, where it was being tested with special radiation that was causing her great pain. The male Gelworm tried many times to reunite with
Once Gelworm grew larger EYES arrived on the scene only for him to evade their attacks. Once an energy net was dropped everything seemed fine until Gelworm's meteor reacted, making him react and shake off the net. Musashi turned into Ultraman Cosmos to save the fighter before fighting Gelworm. Gelworm continued trying to make his way towards his meteor, but Cosmos managed to hold him off until the creature used it's pincers to turn itself into Imitation Cosmos.

Last night, I did a lower body lifting workout - trap bar deadlifts, single leg Romanian deadlifts, kettlebell swings, and Swiss ball bridges/curls. Including my warm-up, the whole thing took less than 50 minutes and I could barely walk out of the gym.
Regretfully, when I got home, the rain hadn't yet started, which meant I needed to finish mowing the lawn. I spent at least 90 minutes finishing the mowing and it just plain sucked. From now on, I'm either going to mow every 3 days or so, or I'm just not going to mow at all. Mowing after a month of rain and rapidly growing grass is torture. It took me about 5 hours over two days to get the mowing done.
This morning was an upper body day in the gym, and my arms are so beat it's hard to type.
Running? I'm going to run tomorrow after work. I think.
I need to do some running miles between now and the VT100, just to be sure I'll be ready to pace. But right now, I'm having fun in the gym.
In about 4 months, the snow guns will be turned on in the northeast and ski sesason will be approaching.

Mowing - gee, I don't do that. Our dirt never grows : )
I think the worst chore, for me (from the perspective of interference with training) was laying squares of linoleum in our kitchen.
I didn't use knee pads - I was SQUATTING for the whole time.
I simply could not walk. For days :)
...yeah, you get the snow and the skiing, but I get...uh, I get...darn. Can't think of a thing : )
You get to not mow your lawn!!!
$10 to the boy gets my lawn mowed fairly regular-like. But it's pretty tiny.

University of Maine STEM Laboratories
Laboratories and departments on the University of Maine campus form educational outreach partnerships with UBMS; these partnerships are symbiotic. Professors often depend on these partnerships to meet grant or tenure criteria and UBMS depends on these partnerships to engage students in legitimate college-level science experiences with distinguished faculty. Many professors accept students into their laboratories because they believe in education and the mission of the program. UBMS also forms partnerships with existing organizations, developing grant opportunities to offer STEM learning opportunities for our students. What follows are some of the program’s more recent collaborations.
National Girls’ Collaborative Project
In 2009, UBMS received a $1000 collaborative grant enabling the students to take part in a water quality Group Research Project. The money funded the purchase of boots, macroinvertebrate nets and water testing kits, among other related items. In partnership with the Lower Penobscot Watershed Coalition, UBMS students collected data related to river and stream health in June and July 2009, for Sedgeunkedunk, Blackman Stream, Souadabscook and the Penjajawok. The program was fortunate to partner with this organization, as well as Maine Department of Environmental Protection Biologist Mark Whiting.
EPSCOR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research)
In 2008, UBMS received full support for the implementation of a Forest Bioproducts research project. Funded by the National Science Foundation, through EPSCoR, the project consisted of three segments: forestry, chemical engineering of forest bioproducts and making biodiesel. The Program was fortunate to partner with State of Maine Forester Ken Laustsen, Washington Academy Science Teacher of the Year Don Sprangers, and University of Maine Chemical Engineering Professor Martin Lawoko. Using the funding provided by EPSCoR, the program was able to buy lab coats and safety equipment to use in the biodiesel and chemical engineering labs. The support funded the participation of professionals and many of the materials used, such as the portable biodiesel chamber for making large batches of biodiesel in educational settings. The project also funded the purchase of secondary containment for the chamber, as well as seven MacBooks, one for each student group. Again in 2009, based on the pre-existing partnership, EPSCoR purchased $1000 worth of supplies for the rivers project, and in 2012 provided full support for Group Research Project faculty, financial support for Individual Project Supplies and financial support to students, all under the umbrella of science education and outreach.

It starts with the endless lunches and cocktail parties in the office for end of the year parties until the start of another and together with the traditional Yuletide festivities highlighted in its midst, there is no excuse not to join in the fun. There is no better way to celebrate its joys than to sit down at a table with family and friends and share all the complements of the season. Of course, for many Overseas Singaporeans, every festive season is also synonymous with fine food. And over the holidays, why not try to cook some of our traditional dishes? Besides bringing a dish of home cooked food makes a wonderful gift to bring along for any get-together or party with friends. What better motivation to spend these hazy lazy days of summer and to share some of our time honoured finger-food recipes– perfect with any party or makan session.

Bond girl
From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
“I have pierced Mr. Brosnan and gone spelunking in Daniel's crag, and I am at last prepared for the big leagues.”
James Bond: stealer of hearts, whacker of villains, Scottish in accent and arrogant in demeanor. But how does he maintain his remarkable attraction despite franchise setbacks and blond hair? A Bond girl is a woman from a James Bond film who serves as a love interest for the suave protagonist. They are always beautiful, and while they are unprincipled in general, they will reverse this lack of morals in order to save Bond when he's in a tight spot, regardless of their previous affiliation with the enemy.
edit Quality of life
The Bondness of a girl is ingrained at birth, but the condition can only be positively identified, and then only at puberty. In overt cases, the Bond girl will become dazed and remote, losing interest in normal activities. He or she will stand on a balcony if there is one, staring into space and muttering something about a lover. The condition can be frightening to family members not properly educated about it. While it is not life threatening, it does affect quality of life significantly. If and when James Bond does arrive, experiential time for the Bond girl will exceed twenty years while only ten minutes will pass for Bond. Once the encounter is over, the Bond girl will return to her stupor, never to take any interest in anything again. The severity of the condition is well known to the Spanish, whose tradition of reserving a day of mourning for their as-yet-unclaimed Bond girls dates back to centuries before Ian Fleming penned his first novel.
As evidenced in From Russia with Love, a Bond girl can maintain some of the qualities of a normal person by maintaining regular correspondence with James Bond. Regular letter writing can alleviate the pain associated with the condition, with the level of relief being proportional to the lavishness of the writing and the imagined probability that Sean Connery will return to her arms. This technique only works in the Bond authors' most tame novels though; the Bond effect has since been transmogrified to ensure the swift, tragic death of any woman who manages to overpower her Bondness to leave the movie set before filming is complete. The difficulty in relieving the condition is typically attributed to its resemblance to a literary device, though this doppleganging is superficial as reality is not literature.
edit The Bond field
The Bond field is a force field permeating all time and space according to the inverse quartic law function. As the field drops off very fast, it is virtually undetectable at distances reasonably far from James Bond or an actor who plays him. Adding to the challenge is the fact that, like all fields in physics, it can only be detected with a test object that is affected by it, in this case a Bond girl. Physicists at CERN tried to strap Bond girls into a supercollider in order to empirically measure the Bond field, but naturally this rendered the girls damsels in distress. When James Bond was through with the place not a single experimental physicist was left alive, leading to the dearth of progress we have in the field today. The Bond field puzzles theoretical physicists such as Stephen Hawking because its equations are of a far higher order of complexity than, say, the Unified Field Theory.
A Bond girl typically does not make the decision to be with James Bond rationally, but rather out of a primitive urge. This motivation forms part of the base of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, but the hierarchy typically excludes it as it is peculiar to Bond girls. Specifically, the Bond field supplies a mental pathos in the Bond girl accompanied by some physical attraction of the gravitational sort. The Bond girl takes on a zeal for saving James Bond from crisis situations such as exploding poker chips and Chinese snipers. The sense of gratification for this is weak, of course, and fades over time, especially as James Bond leaves the poor Bond girl, which he, with few exceptions, always does.
edit Well-known Bond girls
- Goldpenny Moneydollar
- She is Bond's secretary and lover on location, one of the few Bond girls to have the honour of her capitulation to the Bond field being satisfied on a regular basis. The Bond field affliction prevents her from leaving Bond even though he is constantly with other Bond girls and disloyal to her.
- Kitty-Titty
- A femme fatale with a dangerous penchant for cocktail weenies, Kitty outraged audiences for her prominent placement as a villain's henchwoman in Never Dream of Tomorrow Dying Another Day. Melting at the sight of the then-Bond Michael Harris's gently spinning nipples, she ultimately chose to push the giant red button labeled "Blow-em-up-a the lair," sacrificing herself for no reason other than to comply with the Bond effect.
- Helga Russianbone
- As her name implies (Bond films are normally constructed from far deeper stylistic elements), she is a Russian, but what the audience doesn't know until she intimates it to the fourth wall is that she is a spy for the KGB. Through a plot twist, a helicopter, and some sort of utterly unfeasible orbiting laser satellite, she enters Bond's arms. She is foresaken to the depths by the screenplay upon revealing the code to the aircraft-carrier submarine.
- Margaret Hotass
- In the box-office hit "007- Live and Let Goldfinger Die Another Day From The Spy Who Loved Me With Love" James Bond (Played by Larry Linville) goes to a Korean� Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit disguised as a surgeon named Frank and meets the lovely Margarat Hotass (played by Loretta Swit). He proposed to her, but then everything blew up, forcing them to get a new Bond.
- Pussy Vaginacuntboobsnipplessex
- A recurrnig extra who ironically is not attractive and never engages in sexual activity or card games with Mr. Bond. She can typically be found in the background of car/boat/MIG/wombat chase scenes, glaring angirly out a window.
edit How to tell if you're a Bond girl
You may be a Bond girl if:
- You are female.
- You are aged twenty to thirty... one.
- You live in an "exotic" corner of the world.
- You have ever seen or slept with James Bond.
- You live in a town where objects frequently explode.
- You have a sexually suggestive name like "Pussy Galore", "Anita Goodtime" or "Valerie Lotsofsexualintercourse"
- You are fictional.
- You have Several Sexually Transmitted Diseases
- You are sexually aggressive
- You have slept with more than 10 men.
- Your career as an actress went nowhere.
A caveat: the above points are merely heuristics. Anyone could potentially be a Bond girl, without respect to age, gender, reality of person, sexual habits, loyalties, or geographic location. There is no completely reliable test to screen out Bondness. You will just have to live with the fact that you too could be a Bond girl.

Denzel Washington
From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
“Denzel Washington was a really, really bad teacher.”
“I would marry him, if only my nostrils didn't manipulate me into not doing so.”
Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr. (born December 28, 1954) is a teacher. His mother gave him the first name Denzel, which means "devil" in the chopped liver dialect (and that's why we call the devil "Denzel"). But I know him as Mr Washington. Mr Washington was also my mother's schoolmate, my cousin's, sister's, uncle's, brother's, nephew's, second cousin twice removed's son and my dad's best friend. His daughter Shaniqua and her twin brother Shaquille invited me to their birthday party.
edit Denzel "ON FIRE!" Washington: Biography
edit The Early Years
Mr. Washington and my dad Tom Sawyer grew up in Mount Vernon, New York. They became best friends when they met in Sunday School at the Pentecostal church . Mr Washington's father, the Reverend Reverend Denzel Washington who was my cousin's, sister's, uncle's, brother's, nephew's, second cousin twice removed, once lent my dad a paintbrush so that he could whitewash the fence. Sometimes to get out of chores my dad and Mr Washington used to go fishing on the Mississippi. Once they even ran away to become pirates. It was when they were pirates on the Mississippi that they first met my mother Pippi Longstocking, although they met her again the next day at school.
edit Mr. Washington at school
Mr. Washington was my mum's schoolmate at Pennington Grimes Elementary School, but she did not play with him very often because he was a boy. He was in her class for three years. My dad went to the same school but he was in a different class. He did play with Denzel Washington and they remained best friends throughout elementary school. The Reverend Reverend Denzel Washington who was my cousin's, sister's, uncle's, brother's, nephew's, second cousin twice removed decided that my dad, Tom Sawyer was a bad influence on his son, and sent Mr Washington to boarding school. Then he was no longer my mum's schoolmate. At this school he met Spike Lee who became his new best friend. My dad Tom Sawyer never met Spike Lee, but if he had met him I don't think they would have got on.
edit Mr. Washington becomes a teacher
When Mr. Washington left school his friend Spike Lee told him he should be an actor. Spike Lee asked Mr Washington to star in his movie Malcolm X, but Mr Washington only wanted to star in films about pirates. Since Spike Lee didn't want to make a film about pirates the two had a big argument and hit each other with spoons. Mr Washington dressed up like a pirate at home on the weekends, and Spike Lee cast Scottish actor Ewan McGregor in the lead role, resulting in McGregor's meteoric rise to fame. Mr Washington never talked to his best friend ever again and became a teacher at my school.
edit Mr. Washington the teacher
Mr. Washington is not a very popular teacher at my school. He teaches math and physics which are very unpopular subjects. He uses lots of text books and we have to sit silently in his class. Most of the kids don't like him, but I like him because sometimes he smiles and makes jokes. One day when he was talking about the theory of relativity he said to the whole physics class, "We didn't land on Plymouth Rock. Plymouth Rock landed on us!"
Some of the girls in my class think he is really good looking, but I think they're just being silly. He seems to like me because he has given me good grades. He gave me a certificate that made my parents Tom Sawyer and Pippi Longstocking very proud.
edit Mr. Washington the Police Officer
My cousin said that 13 years ago Mr. Washington had a break from teaching. He was very interested in elephant mating and went to the Doctor Doolittle Academy, Los Angeles to learn to how to talk to the animals. But he was quietly and quickly expelled for making a classmate smoke a bowl of marijuana with a little hint of TNT, a dash of hitler, and a pinch of pure evil at tip point. After laughing and yelling AUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa!!! and throwing a few racial slurs around, he was reinstated and graduated the same day. He received the Academy's highest honor, Badass Cum Sallovertheplace only to return to teaching at my school three minutes later.

edit From Pee Review
Hello. This is my first time putting something in review. I'm not sure if it's the best though. I'd like to look for things to improve or add to it, cause I'd like to make it funnier and all, since it's supposed to reference and poke fun at fighting games in general. I feel I've got some good things down, but it needs something more, something I feel is missing... a sense of completion, perhaps?
Please don't be too harsh or critical on it, go easy on me, okay? I'll do my best to improve it. --Hanyouman 13:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
Hm, you mean that "dues ex machina" thing? I had thought about putting that in, thanks for reminding me. I'll try what I can and I hope more people will give me suggestions on what more to do with it.
I do hope to improve the Characters section, since I feel it's essential for poking fun at what we usually seen for characters and stuff, and that me and other people who wish to contribute help with it. :) --Hanyouman 20:46, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
edit From Pee Review 2
Okay, this is my second time putting this article through Pee Review. I've improved on it some (and a couple people added their ideas too), but I feel my weakest is in the Character Types section, which I feel is essential to the article's humor. There's a way to poke fun at them that I need to tap into, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Possibly a few other areas that I have wary feelings on too, but not sure on them either. So any advice or ideas would be nice. Again, don't be too harsh on me.
I hope I can improve upon this some more so that it's just right. Thanks for any help, it's appreciated. --Hanyouman 00:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
Hey this has definitely improved tons since I reviewed it the first time. I maybe wouldn't score it quite so highly but I have a natural aversion to being overly positive - it's really good. I'm guessing from the amount of work you've put into it you'll be looking at VFH pretty soon. The most important thing to work on now is the introduction. Get your readers to laugh out loud in the first few lines and they'll be on your side right the way through. At the moment I would be reluctant to vote for it since most of our ADHD afflicted viewers would simply give up before they got to the meat of it. --Kelpan 23:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
edit From Pee Review
Third time's a charm, eh?
I know this is probably getting tedious or something by now, but I would still like to know where I can improve this without removing anything too vital (there's a few things in there I feel are important to it). So any advice would be nice as long as you're not being mean about it or something. If you wanna discuss it feel free to leave me a message or whatnot.
I'm just trying my hardest to make it as good as I can. I appreciate any help. --Hanyouman 17:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

Sheriff Takes Lesbian Drug Addict To Ex-Gay Evangelists Instead of Rehab
Amanda Booker is suing the pants off of Bartow County Georgia’s police force after her arrest led to a nightmarish kidnapping and imprisonment at an evangelical Ex-Gay center instead of one of the court-ordered drug rehab programs she was meant to attend..”
Paging Officer Homophobe! This story sounds INSANE.
Booker names 11 defendants in her lawsuits, and if her story is true (It sounds too crazy to have been made up), we hope a jury serves up a hot plate of justice. Preventing Booker from attaining the drug rehabilitation treatment she medically needed is bad enough, but forcing her to endure a week of religious fanaticism is just unbelievable.
If the homophobic culture of the Bartow County Police Force allowed this incident to manifest, we can only imagine other illegal and discriminatory conduct is going on as well. For the sake of all the LGBT residents of Bartow County, we hope some serious changes are made, and that those responsible for this horrific conduct lose their badges.
What the heck is going on in the Bartow County Sheriff’s Office?

Fear is inertia. It’s a reluctance to change direction or a lack of energy that keeps you stuck.
The way to fight fear is simple. Each and every time you find yourself at a crossroads, and you know that the only thing keeping you from moving forward is fear, then you should head in that direction—even if your fear seems too big to handle. To turn back is to be defeated. If you choose to be defeated, you’ll remain scared until your dying days.
When you have a feeling that resembles fear, track it. That is, ask questions and pay close attention to what you discover. Find out its origin. Maybe you just need a refresher in learning how to jump over the obstacle. Listen to your body as you keep asking questions. Why am I feeling scared? What would make me feel calmer about this situation? What led me to be at this place today?
Keep building momentum to jump over the obstacle. Keep building your personal power. Fighting fear will do this.

Good news on federal policy for families in poverty
Stop taking low-income fathers’ money away from their children; help fathers form better relationships with children and mothers; don’t make legal marriage more important than good parenting. Finally, the federal government’s approach to the role of family structure in the lives of low-income children is starting to look more reasonable and realistic.
In a conference call last week, two Special Assistants to the President revealed the administration’s new strategy for TANF grants. The $150 million annual allocation for Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood will be split evenly between the two program types ($75M for marriage and $75M for fatherhood) in next year’s budget as well as this year’s current funding. There will be a new competition for these funds, and previous grantees will have to demonstrate past success to be considered for future grants. Marriage programs can’t get fatherhood funds just to keep doing marriage stuff (or vice versa).
This amounts to a permanent 25% reduction in marriage promotion and 33% increase in fatherhood funding. On the call, Martha Coven, Special Assistant to the President for Mobility and Opportunity, described it as a welcome increase for fatherhood. She also said the administration had decided to follow this funding pattern because it was acceptable to Congress, rather than dig in to fight for the much bigger state-level competition for innovative marriage, fatherhood and family programming which it had proposed last year.
The call further revealed the administration’s much bigger focus on fatherhood, in the form of a package of improvements to the child support system worth $2.8 billion over 10 years (i.e., averaging $280 million annually). The world of low-income child support collection is maddening for everyone, not least because it was originally designed as a cost recovery plan for welfare agencies. This design concept causes friction between mothers and fathers, fathers and children, families and agencies, courts and jails, and even between the federal and state governments. Much of the proposed federal funding will be used to pay the states to modernize and humanize their systems. Not my area of expertise, but sounds like a really good idea!
Now here’s the less good news – the line between fatherhood programs and marriage promotion is not as bright as you might hope. Here’s how federal law describes fatherhood programming (italics added):
1).
2) Activities to promote responsible parenting through activities such as counseling, mentoring, and mediation, disseminating information about good parenting practices, skills-based parenting education, encouraging child support payments, and other methods.
3).
4) Activities to promote responsible fatherhood that are conducted through a contract with a nationally recognized, nonprofit fatherhood promotion organization, such.
So, we can enjoy a modest celebration but it’s not time to kick back and relax. We’re pursuing two goals in 2011: first, to influence the ongoing use of TANF funds so that programs are less rigidly focused on marriage and more helpful to people in diverse relationships; second, to influence the reauthorization of TANF so that marriage promotion will not be stated as its primary purpose for the next five years.

Will Obama really fund failed marriage programs?
The President of the United States has proposed the federal budget – his wish list of revenues and expenses covering the period October 1, 2011 – September 30, 2012. Budgets, whether federal, nonprofit or family, are statements of priorities, goals and hopes. AtMP keeps an eye on certain federal budget lines that show whether the government promotes legal, different-sex marriage as being better than other relationships or family forms.
Unfortunately, while cutting things people really need, the President is proposing to fund two marriage-related programs that should be abandoned because they are insulting at best, and downright dangerous at worst:
- the grant program called Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood is still carving out $150 million per year from welfare funds under the umbrella of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
- to paraphrase our friends at SIECUS (the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States), the President is also continuing to put $50 million a year into Title V abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, which have been widely discredited and proven by the federal government’s own study to be ineffective.
I’ll get to the second program another time. Today I’m wondering: Why are the TANF programs still funded?
Marriage programs are not a presidential priority. In his budget statement, Obama does not mention marriage at all. He does discuss fatherhood, mostly in the context of the very good idea of urging states to let fathers’ child support payments reach their children instead of getting absorbed into state treasuries. But it took quite a bit of digging to find any reference to this funding continuation (fellow wonks, see page 473).
The administration knows that marriage programs don’t work. An evaluation of an eight-site TANF-funded marriage program found no net effects on participants’ relationships.
The President’s team tried to replace marriage programs last year. Joshua Dubois – Special Assistant to the President and Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships – spearheaded a campaign to replace marriage programs with a potentially better, experimental package focused on the economic needs of low-income parents. (We commented on it extensively here.)
Congress moved money from marriage to fatherhood last year. When Congress extended budget lines instead of passing a whole budget last year, it assigned $75 million instead of $100 million to marriage programs. Fatherhood programs got a corresponding increase from $50 to 75 million.
In sum, I see a glimmer of hope. Although the title and size of the budget item is the same, maybe there’s a plan to develop a completely different kind of operating program using that money. AtMP and our allies will keep an eye on it, and we’ll weigh in with suggestions about how federal funds could be put to good use to reduce poverty and improve child outcomes.
Here are some basic components: financial assistance to cover food, shelter, health care etc; early childhood education; relationship skills and supports to help adults be great parents and partners. Want more ideas about how reducing poverty can improve a child’s prospects ? There’s a compelling article by Duncan and Magnuson article starting on page 25 of this magazine on poverty, inequality and social policy.
Marriage programs return to federal welfare budget
In the waning days of the year, marriage programs poured on the charm (i.e., lobbied like mad) and got themselves partially reinstated in the federal budget. Congress had not included marriage programs when it funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, the umbrella welfare program) from October through December 2010. However, it did include them in the new extension through September 2011, though at only three-quarters of their previous dollar level – $75 million instead of $100 million.
Fatherhood programs got a corresponding increase from $50 to 75 million. From the sidelines, it can be interesting to watch the tug of war between marriage and fatherhood programs. The Obama administration wanted to merge them into one, even bigger, program that would be managed by the states. Our analysis of all that is available here. Congress also seemed to favor programs that help low-income fathers get jobs and stay involved with their kids. A bill called the Julia Carson Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2009 (H.R. 2979) was being considered as an alternative to the administration’s proposal. That bill would have to start from scratch in the new Congress.
The extra year of funding will allow Congress (and us) to review the evaluation results for many more marriage programs before deciding whether to include them in the full five-year reauthorization of TANF. Of course, the programs are acutely aware of the importance of demonstrating positive results.
Marriage is not an anti-poverty strategy
Last month we quietly celebrated the end of federal welfare funding for marriage programs. One reason our cheer was so muted was that Congress had let the programs die with a whimper by refusing to act on the President’s budget proposal. Instead of ensuring a safety net for very-low income people for years to come, Congress gave just a few months extension to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF – the main anti-poverty program). The extension did not cover marriage programs, nor did it cover “the Emergency Fund, which was created as a stimulus effort and helped millions of very low-income people make ends meet through the worst part of the Great Recession.” Next year we can hope for a full renewal of the safety net, plus a proper debate about whether marriage or relationship education belong in welfare funding.
At about that same anti-climactic moment, the Women of Color Policy Network published an interesting report about unmarried mothers. It has lots of good information, but strangely does not recommend policies to reduce marital status discrimination. This is especially surprising given single mothers’ low incomes, which might get a lift if we prohibited marital status discrimination in employment (yes, that’s still legal in all states except these).
Single mothers not only earn less than men, but they earn only 77 percent as much as married women with children and 87 percent as much as single women without children. In contrast, unmarried men with children earned 8 percent more than unmarried men without children.
As the report says, “lower earnings no doubt contribute to the wealth gap for single mothers, but they are just the tip of the iceberg.” Here are a few interesting excerpts about the intersection of wealth and marital status:
There is no single reason for the lack of wealth among single women mothers; the reasons are manifold and interrelated: lower wages and life-time earnings, occupational segmentation, lack of access to wealth escalators such as retirement and pension plans, and historic structural and institutional discrimination, among others. …
… Single mothers who have never been married have less wealth than women whose pathway to single motherhood was through divorce or widowhood. Divorced or widowed single mothers have a median wealth of $7,500 whereas single mothers who never married have a median wealth of zero. …
… Marriage is associated with higher wealth for two reasons: first, many women wait until they are financially stable to marry; second, marriage has wealth-building advantages such as economies of scale. Upon divorce, mothers may be able to access any wealth accumulated during marriage. Additionally, divorced single mothers are much more likely to receive child support, which gives them more disposable income to save or invest. …
Note to marriage promoters: these correlations still do NOT make marriage an ethical or effective anti-poverty strategy.
No more welfare funds for marriage promoters
This week, AtMP sent the Senate Finance Committee a petition calling for the end of federally-funded marriage promotion, along with detailed analysis and recommendations on the use of anti-poverty funds for marriage and fatherhood programs. AtMP’s statement describes the differences between marriage promotion, relationship education, and fatherhood programs. We ask Congress to use the evidence it has received to set performance standards for President Obama’s proposed $500 million Fatherhood, Marriage and Families Innovation Fund.
In contrast to President Bush’s $750 million program, we want the new Fund to
- serve only low-income people;
- not discriminate on the basis of marital status or sexual orientation, nor stigmatize unmarried
- relationships;
- make relationship education inclusive of all relationships;
- develop standards, educational requirements and/or an accreditation system for relationship
- educators;
- let service providers work from their strengths rather than pursue fads;
- help men and women be great parents and partners, not husbands and wives;
- not confuse parenting with gender role-modeling; and
- gather and publish evaluation results quickly.
Finally, we suggest directions for re-envisioning federal anti-poverty efforts, with the ultimate goal of eliminating poverty. All people, including people in poverty, should be legally and economically free to choose whether and when to marry or form other healthy relationships.

Big news on welfare-funded marriage programs: they don’t work
At last, a moment we’ve been waiting for! The release of a major evaluation of marriage programs funded by federal welfare dollars titled “Early Impacts from the Building Strong Families Project,” written by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. under a federal contract. Punch line: they don’t work.
The executive summary is very worth reading. It does not sugar-coat the dismal results, and I love the opening line: “Although most children raised by single parents fare well, …”
Our friend Shawn Fremsted at Center for Economic & Policy Research does a nice job of summarizing, concluding that the federal Healthy Marriage Initiative was a mistake that shouldn’t be repeated. Hear hear!
Rather than re-hash, I’ll add a comment on how the report’s detailed information about program operations speaks to the question of whether marriage programs should receive anti-poverty funds. I’m writing from the perspective of having spent 13 years working in low income neighborhoods around NYC, designing and running social service and housing programs for TANF* recipients and other community residents.
Mathematica reports that “Most BSF programs had little or no effect on relationships; however, there were two notable exceptions. The Oklahoma City program had a consistent pattern of positive effects, while the Baltimore program had a number of negative effects.” Oklahoma City was the only one using a relationship curriculum especially designed for low-income / low-literacy couples. Baltimore recruited couples with the lowest incomes and the lowest levels of commitment to each other or the program. Oklahoma City’s program was purpose-built; Baltimore’s was added to a pre-existing program “known for providing employment and fatherhood services to low-income men since 1999.” Although only 45% of participants in OK City graduated, that is five times higher than all the other programs.
There are many other distinctions, of course. But these few suggest that these marriage programs didn’t just fail, they failed to address the realities of people with very low incomes who could have been receiving more effective anti-poverty services if TANF funds hadn’t been diverted by marriage-happy politicians.
We eagerly await the release of more marriage program evaluations. To learn more about the upcoming evaluations, and what we hope to learn from them, turn to page 14 of Let Them Eat Wedding Rings.

Becoming an Adult Without Getting Married
When does a person become an adult? What is adulthood, and why does it matter? How have the answers to these questions changed over time, and what do the changes mean for American society? How should civic institutions respond?
These fascinating questions are the subject of Transition to Adulthood, the latest in a research series called The Future of Children published by Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School (my alma mater) and the Brookings Institution. This anthology of 10 essays does not answer all those questions. In fact, it doesn’t seem to recognize that some exist; but, it does provide valuable insight into demographic trends and policy responses.
Why review it here? Because, according to one of the authors,
Becoming an adult has traditionally been understood as comprising five core transitions – leaving home, completing school, entering the workforce, getting married, and having children.
However,
Today… only about half of Americans consider it necessary to marry or have children to be regarded as an adult.
The question begs so hard it practically jumps off the page: should marriage and parenthood still be understood as markers of adulthood by researchers and policy makers? Amazingly, none of the 19 authors in this anthology seem interested in changing their traditional understanding. For example, one lists women’s tendency “to delay marriage and parenthood” as a factor that has “helped to delay and complicate the passage to adulthood.” Even the use of “transition” (singular) in the book’s title suggests the authors’ devotion to the idea of one right way to become an adult, despite the rich diversity of reality which their data describe so well.
Equally amazing, none of the authors unpack the implied moral or normative value of adulthood; no one explains why it matters. Of course, I’d rather live in a country where my fellow adults act like adults, not like children. But my common sense definition of “acting like an adult” has little to do with the “five core transitions.” A book that recommends governmental and civic action towards a goal ought to justify why that goal is good for individuals and society. Instead, the closest it comes to explaining why adulthood matters is to describe the negative
consequences of the extended transition. … [F]irst … the growing burden placed on the middle- and lower-income families who were providing their children with schooling, housing, health insurance and income well beyond the age range of 18 – 21, the traditional age of majority. … [S]econd… the unexpected strain being imposed on key social institutions.
One thing the anthology does very well is highlight the different life patterns experienced by people of different gender, race/ethnicity, economic class and immigration history. For example, it cites one study of children of immigrants who (rather than becoming a long-term burden) provide regular or even total financial support to their parents, and another study finding that children of immigrants “differed in several ways from conventional American norms of departing the parental household and setting up a separate home.”
Another question begged: whose norms are “conventional?” A different essay mentions that “youth and parents from less-advantaged families continue to favor an earlier departure from the home than do those of more advantaged means.” Furthermore, “women are typically younger than men when they leave home because they complete college earlier, form cohabiting unions earlier, and marry about two years earlier, on average, than men.” However, “young mothers who do not enter a union before bearing a child typically remain in the parental home for several years and receive financial support and child care from their parents.”
What Transition to Adulthood does best is provide heaps of fascinating data. Here are just a few highlights about marriage and its alternatives: “About half of high school seniors say that they plan to cohabit as couples before they marry. … By age 34, 7 in 10 have tied the knot. … [T]he percentages of people who have never married, and who are intentionally childless, are higher now than at any other time in American history….”
Given this nation’s obsession with marriage and parenting – and our politicians’ willingness to legislate behavior – I was especially struck by the fact that, while there are many studies of people who are relatively rich or poor, “[r]esearchers know far less about the family formation patterns of young adults who grow up in families with modest resources.” Isn’t that the majority of us? I was also glad to see recognition that “young people who can build stronger and wider connections to adults other than parents (for example, teachers and adult mentors) also end up faring better than those who do not.” (emphasis in original)
With essays on education, labor, the military, civic engagement and “vulnerable populations,” as well as the immigration and family formation sections I’ve highlighted, Transition to Adulthood offers plenty of food for thought. I do hope that its target audience of “policy makers, practitioners and the media” will dig into the rich details and give more thought to what adulthood is, how people get there, and why it matters. Otherwise, we’ll end up with more legal carrots and sticks, more media hype, and less real help to build a society where we all can thrive.
Why TANF must give economic aid & help all relationships
Two heartrending news articles crossed my desk this morning. Both highlight the reasons that TANF (the main federal anti-poverty program) should focus on economic assistance. They also point to the importance of healthy relationships for all people, regardless of marital status. If any federal money is going to pay for relationship education, it really must be available to people in every type of relationship.
Women’s e-News details how the recession contributed to an increase in domestic violence.
The New York Times details how evictions have a disparate impact on unmarried African-American women.
President Obama’s budget proposal offers a one-year extension and expansion of marriage programs. Few details are available yet, but we’re inclined to agree with our colleague Wendy Mink, who writes.

Conversations with a chief marriage promoter
A few days ago as I was heading into the office, my Blackberry picked up an email posting to AtMP-Talk, our interactive listserve. AtMP-TALK has been hosting important, enlightening and sometimes silly conversations among over 500 members for over a decade, but it had been pretty quiet in recent months. This posting caught my eye not only because it broke the silence, but also because of the writer’s name: Chris Gersten. “Gee, that sounds familiar” I thought as I walked up the stairs and unlocked the office door, then “nah, it couldn’t be him!” When my PC warmed up, I confirmed that yes, Chris Gersten is the chairman of the Fatherhood & Marriage Leadership Insititute, and yes, he has been lurking on our listserve since mid-September (not coincidentally, around the same time I last blogged about FAMLI). I posted his brief bio to the list and wondered what would happen next.
Chris’s initial message made several general statements about the value of marriage and government-funded marriage programs, including
[M]arriage is the critical building block for every civilization since the dawn of time. It is the institution that all the social science research tells us is best for children to be raised in. It is also very difficult for people in marriages to maintain strong relationships over the years. There is nothing wrong with society and government understanding that it is in the interest of the broader society for married couples to get help.
Of course, Chris works to secure not only government understanding, but big funding for marriage programs. AtMP opposes this use of funds, and invites the public to sign our petition.
Member responses came in quickly. Almost all were thoughtful, detailed, respectful and passionate about cherishing diversity, protecting children and supporting relationships. I’m really proud that AtMP has such wise members! Here is a brief sample of what AtMP members said:
FAMILIES are the critical building block. People need to be “built” in stable families in order to become adults who function well regardless of the living situation they choose. Adults who live alone aren’t destroying society. But children can’t be single; they need families.
What the social science research tells us is that children do best with a consistent, reliable family and adequate physical and emotional care. Married parents look good in research because the majority of consistent two-adult households are married ones. However, studies of other family types such as stable same-sex couples show that the important variable is not marriage but stability–having the same adults in the family throughout childhood. There are many advantages to having more than one
adult (particularly with more than one child) but single parents who intentionally became parents while single tend to do very well.
- ‘Becca
Several people echoed and expanded on the importance of family stability and relationship education.
I was going to ask about the nature of the help for married couples that is being funded, and why it wouldn’t be helpful for unmarried couples as well. You’ve explained that marriage education programs are really relationship education for all. Why not just call it that? Isn’t that a worthy goal?
- Kelly
Chris, if you replaced the word “marriage” with “loving, intimate, relationship” I might agree with a lot of what you say. However, marriage as a social/cultural/legal status has little to do with whether a relationship is loving or intimate! Programs should be aimed at improving love, communication, and intimacy in all relationships. Then the children would really benefit.
- Rene
Others raised questions and theories about the evolution of marriage and its connection to poverty.
Jobs for women pay less and are less likely to provide health insurance. Day care is expensive, and women’s wages simply aren’t high enough. Marriage has been a building block of civilizations because women have been relegated out of society outside the home. … We should be working to raise people up out of poverty, and marriage will *not* create that change. Improving work environments for women, creating opportunity in impoverished neighborhoods, and putting a stop to the shaming of single parents and their children will greatly help improve outcomes for children of single parents.
- Carolyn
Marriage was created as a mechanism by which to manage property. Our idea of “love marriage” is a recent invention. Marriage has historically been a partnership formed by families (most marriages were arranged in all cultures for centuries) for financial reasons.
- Jillian
Chris replied to most member responses, mentioning (but not formally citing) studies, percentages, experts and pastors, and stating “these are not just opinions. They are facts.” Our studious members were ready.
You know what, Chris? MARRIAGE CAUSES DIVORCE. There is a 100% correlation, and the causation is clear: Every divorced couple was married before divorce! Speaking more seriously … as best I can recall from my reading, child poverty and infant mortality have *decreased* significantly since 1960 (although there have been upticks recently, they’re not back up to pre-1960 levels), low birth weight is still a problem but hasn’t changed much, and child abuse is hard to measure reliably because of drastic changes in reporting standards.
- ‘Becca
How DARE you call me or my kids a national disaster.
Several members referred to Dr. Bella DePaulo’s careful analysis of marriage studies, and at least one contacted her offline to ask her to weigh in, which she did:
Thanks to those of you who recommended my book and my blog. Since Chris has specifically
challenged my work (obviously, without reading it), I’ll say a bit more.
Chapter 9 of my book, SINGLED OUT, is about the children of single parents. There, I explain why Chris’s claims do not pass muster and how those studies are so widely misinterpreted. (Because Chris seems to value appeals to authority over a close reading of the original research, I’ll mention that my PhD is from Harvard, I have more than 100 academic publications to my name, and I’ve taught graduate courses in research methods for decades.) My chapter directly addresses some of the claims Chris makes, such as the one about the alleged drug abuse among the children of single parents. I explain, in detail, how particular kinds of studies are misrepresented; so if you make the same methodological mistake each time (such as confusing correlation with causality, as Rachel pointed out), it doesn’t matter if you have 50 studies or 50,000 studies – if they are flawed, they can’t be used to support your point.
I stay on top of studies that have appeared after Singled Out was published. Many of my critiques can be found in a recent collection, SINGLE WITH ATTITUDE. I’ve also posted some critiques at my Living Single blog at Psychology Today. Here are a few specifically relevant to the points about the children of single parents:
1. Children of Single Mothers: How Do They Really Fare?
2. It Takes a Single Person to Create a Village
3. TIME’s Misleading Cover Story on Marriage
- Bella DePaulo
Members were uniformly unimpressed by Chris’s responses, and after about 48 hours the email storm collapsed in a heap of fatigue and curiosity, with members asking “Why is a former Bush Administration official on this listserve?” and “Are you just bored and looking for someone to harangue?”
Tiresome as it may be, we can expect many more conversations like this in 2010, because federal funding for marriage programs is up for renewal this year. If you agree that anti-poverty funds should be dedicated to reducing poverty, and relationship education should help everyone regardless of marital status, then please sign our petition!

We’ve all been there. Wake up early for first chair, roll out of your inflatable mattress and head to the kitchen only to remember that it has been weeks since you bought any food. A fried egg or two would be ideal in this situation, maybe on a bagel with some pepper jack and hot sauce, who knows? The accoutrement is optional, but anyway who wants to pull out that large pan and crack a few eggs into it, then burn your bagel while you try and corral you eggs into a bagel-sized mess? Nobody. And that is why we usually just skip getting breakfast food all together and just go skiing.
What if there was a small, egg-sized pan that fries a perfect egg every time? A pan that could be carried to the lift line when GNAR points are needed? A pan that could change your life? Such a pan would even nicely fit in with camping supplies. There is such a pan. I just call my small pan the “perfect egg,” but for this review I looked up the proper name, just to share with all of you. The One Egg Wonder Pan is a mere $5 and will be your new lift-line companion and GNAR point MVP. It’s got a Teflon non-stick surface too so your backpack won’t start to smell like old grease after a few lift-line toasadas. Raving customer reviews will reveal, “the One Egg Wonder Pan’s compact design fits one egg perfectly [it’s true]”. But that is only because it’s difficult for the average breakfast connoisseurto say a whole lot about an unusually small pan. I’ll let the experts expand.
According to the American Egg Board, One egg has 13 essential nutrients in varying amounts, including high-quality protein, choline, folate, iron and zinc, for 70 calories. Eggs also play a role in weight management, muscle strength, healthy pregnancy, brain function, eye health and more. Not to mention, eggs are crucial to being the best skier on the mountain, everybody knows that. So this weekend, hold out on buying that last drink at the bar and go get yourself the One Egg Wonder Pan, it practically sells itself. See you in the lift line.

Welcome to the new University of Louisville Department of Orthopaedic Surgery web site. We would like to tell you about the exciting things happening here as we carry on the rich 81-year history which began at the Kosair Crippled Children’s Hospital and has grown to include 20 orthopaedic surgery residents, 11 full-time faculty members, and 26 clinical faculty.
Our outstanding full-time faculty do much of the “heavy lifting”. These individuals deserve to be credited for their leadership and expertise: Dr. David Seligson for orthopaedic traumatology; Dr. Arthur Malkani and Dr. Madhu Yakkanti for adult reconstruction; Dr. Edward Tillett for the arthroscopy laboratory; Dr. Trey Crawford and Dr. Steve Glassman for spine surgery and spine research; Dr. John Dimar for spine surgery and serving as Chief of Pediatrics at Kosair Hospital, and Dr. John Johnson for spine surgery and spine research; Dr. John Nyland for outcomes research; and Dr. Mike Voor for the orthopaedic bioengineering laboratory.
On February 1, 2011, I became the 8th leader
of the Orthopaedic Surgery enterprise at the
University of Louisville School of Medicine.
The Department has traditionally been known
for its strengths in orthopaedic traumatology
and spine surgery. The subspecialties of
adult reconstruction, pediatric orthopaedics,
and sports medicine are also growing with
leaps and bounds. My vision is to elevate
our residency training program to top ten status,
bring Federal funding into the Department, and
significantly grow the clinical enterprise so that it is a huge resource to the region.
Our Department is currently at the tipping point of exponential growth and development. We added a night float rotation, expanded our conference series to a four-hour block of time on Friday mornings which starts with Grand Rounds, linked the educational conferences to a curriculum, and created new rotations in foot/ankle, and musculoskeletal oncology. A new orthopaedic traumatologist will also be joining the faculty fairly soon!
We want you to be a part of what is going on in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. I assure you, we are only warming up. Together we can do great things in the future.
Very truly yours,
Craig S. Roberts, MD, MBA
K. Armand Fischer Professor and Chair
Department of Orthopaedic Surgery

Our Daisy Belle chicken has been in moult; the lass is clogging on a bit in years, here she is in her youth in 2007
She can’t mange such a resplendent plumage these days. But she is working on this seasons feathers right now.
Chickens stop laying when they moult and general act ‘out of sorts’ not quite hanging out with the rest of the flock, first in the hen house at night, last out in a morning, having a bad feather day I suppose. They moult once a year, they don’t loose all the feathers at once (I’m not even sure how often some feathers are replaced, not every year I think).
Here she is with her new feathers emerging. Bless.
The quill grows first, and then the feather emerges from the tip of the quill,
it looks like she’s covered in little paint brushes.
Reader Charles is concerned for Spuds the dogs welfare, as he has been absent of late. I can report he is fine, muddy and wet, but that’s Springers for you… He’ll be along soon.

Finders (Not) Keepers
Twice in five years, writer lost her electronics while traveling. What happened next surprised her.
I seem to have bad luck with electronics when traveling. These two stories top them all. They also illustrate stories of remarkable honesty.
August 2006:
During a trip to Colorado, I accidentally left my new Canon DSLR on a rock near a dam we stopped to see. Even worse, the card inside held over two weeks worth of irreplaceable family vacation photos.
I felt physically sick when we reached our trailhead in the heart of the San Juan Mountains and realized it had been left behind.
When we returned to the dam after a 60-mile round-trip drive down dusty, bumpy roads, the rock was there, the camera was gone.
My heart sank.
Instead of a fun birthday hike for my hubby, we spent the day frantically looking for my camera at every campground throughout the area. Perhaps someone had turned it in. Or maybe someone had spotted it and figured, “My lucky day!”
We returned to "the rock" several hours later. To my disbelief, there was a note in a plastic baggie.
Could it be? Were there still honest people in this world? I frantically opened the baggie and ripped out the note.
It said, “Found camera. Call to give description and retrieve.”
Hallelujah! My faith in mankind had been restored.
Fast forward to July 2011:
When we arrived in Las Vegas, it was too early to check into our room. The bellboy offered to store our luggage until our room was ready.
I decided to keep my MacBook with me, “just in case.” My laptop and camera are my lifelines to family, friends and work. Knowing my luck with electronics, I didn't want to take any chances.
Having my hands full, I asked my 9-year-old, Addison, to carry the MacBook for me.
We decided to hang out at Starbucks until we got the call for the room. After about an hour of relaxing with drinks, we gathered our things to leave.
The MacBook was missing.
“I just set it over here on this table, mom,” Addison said.
I searched above, below … every which way to find that slim laptop which happened to be full of very useful and important photos and information.
My heart skipped a few beats. Did someone TAKE it from right in front of us?
Maybe what’s taken to Vegas stays in Vegas, too!
I raced to the baristas to see if they knew anything about it. The young girl looked me over with caution and asked its color.
“Purple with white skulls and cross bones,” I said. (My husband’s gift to me.)
“Yes,” she said. “Someone picked it up off the table and thought it had been left here. It's being held in security.”
Hallelujah, again.
The moral of the stories:
There are still honest people in this world. Good DOES shine through.
My electronics were saved once again!

Bidding Adieu To Congressional Trailblazers
Originally published on Wed January 9, 2013 8:15 am
The drama over the fiscal cliff and the familiar up-against-a-deadline dysfunction of Congress have largely overshadowed the leave-taking of some Capitol Hill originals.
So we wanted to remember a few true congressional trailblazers whose long Washington careers are ending. They include the first openly gay member of Congress, a leader of the libertarian movement, the first Jewish candidate to run on a major party presidential ticket, and the most fervent supporter of a U.S. Department of Peace.
While many members of Congress are departing by choice (like GOP Tea Party godfather Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who is taking a high-paying think tank job) or by loss (like eight-term Rep. Leonard Boswell, an Iowa Democrat who lost to a fellow incumbent in a redistricting battle), these are some we won't soon forget.
HOUSE
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
In his own words: "I'm used to being in a minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority."
At 72, Frank will wrap up more than three decades in the House, where he became not only the first openly gay member of Congress but also the first to get married to a same-sex partner.
Elected to the Massachusetts House in 1972, the irascible, irrepressible Frank co-sponsored that state's first gay-rights bill. "He was willing to speak out and be public about his sexual orientation when he was the only one," Lois Pines, who served in the state House with Frank, told us at the Democratic National Convention.
In the U.S. House, Frank was an advocate of affordable housing, a lightning rod for GOP criticism for co-writing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, and survived a 1990 House reprimand for fixing a male prostitute's parking ticket.
But his legacy will most likely always be best defined by traits he saw defining him as a perpetual outsider, including and especially his sexual orientation.
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas
In his own words: "There is only one kind of freedom, and that's individual liberty. Our lives come from our creator, and our liberty comes from our creator. It has nothing to do with government granting it."
Paul, a 77-year-old obstetrician who has served in the House for nearly a quarter century, has himself said he may appear in stature and tone an unlikely movement leader.
But the Texas native is a hero to libertarians — whom he once represented on a presidential ticket — and repeat GOP presidential candidate, much to the consternation of many party regulars. Before the 2012 presidential race, Paul's fierce supporters took over GOP leadership in a handful of states and battled publicly to get his delegates seated at Mitt Romney's nominating convention.
Nicknamed "Dr. No," Paul made news in 2009 when the first of 620 measures he had sponsored in his House career finally passed. He's remained consistently anti-intervention, anti-tax, anti-Federal Reserve and pro-gold standard. Social issues, he's argued, should be decided by the states.
His financial views, opposition to the war and criticism of government intrusion on personal privacy attracted an unlikely coalition of supporters. Paul's legacy now largely lies in the hands of his son, Rand, a first-term U.S. senator from Kentucky who shares his father's views, if not his unconventional appeal.
Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio
In his own words: "I am running for president of the United States to enable the Goddess of Peace to encircle within her arms all the children of this country and all the children of the world."
With the departure of Kucinich, 66, whose two quixotic runs for president served as a platform for his anti-war and pro-universal health care stands, Congress will lose its biggest dove and, perhaps, its most unconventional member.
The once-heralded youngest mayor of a major American city (Cleveland), Kucinich leaves a legacy of futile advocacy for a U.S. Department of Peace and Nonviolence, criticism of the nation's use of drones for targeted killing, and push for universal health care.
"I'm not selling insurance," he said in 2003. "I want to create a system which makes it possible for all Americans to have health care."
Kucinich, who as mayor ultimately earned the enmity of Cleveland voters when the city went into default under his leadership, is not willingly leaving the House: He lost after eight terms to fellow Democrat Marcy Kaptur in a primary after their districts were realigned.
But he'll be remembered as a critic of his own party for aligning with corporate interests, and as a peace advocate who used to some effect the language of conflict to bring attention to the poor, characterizing both poverty and unemployment as "weapons of mass destruction."
SENATE
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine
In her own words: "We've miniaturized the Senate. All we're doing is debating messaging points for the next election and the next political ad. Messaging isn't doing anything to bring the country together."
At 65, and after three terms, the moderate Snowe has said she's leaving the Senate in large part because of its historic dysfunction and lack of a goal of doing "what's in the best interests of our country."
A former member of the Maine state House and Senate, Snowe was sworn in to the U.S. House in 1979 and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994.
With her fellow Maine Republican, Sen. Susan Collins, Snowe has been in the middle of debates ranging from recent wars, which she supported, and Senate filibusters of judicial nominees, which she worked to block. She voted against President Obama's health care legislation, but for the Wall Street bailout and stimulus funding.
An advocate of environmental protections, Snowe has also supported legalized abortion and gay rights. Though frequently targeted by conservative Republican organizations, she remained exceedingly popular at home and won re-election in 2006 with more than 74 percent of the vote. In November, Maine voters picked independent former Gov. Angus King to replace her. He'll caucus with Senate Democrats.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
In his own words: "There are no shortcuts to victory. We must commit ourselves to the slow, painstaking work of foreign policy day by day and year by year."
It has been suggested that Lugar's primary loss this year to Tea Party Republican Richard Mourdock after 36 years in the Senate was proof positive that the GOP has no more room for moderates.
And though Lugar, at 80, ran a poor campaign and was criticized for being out of touch, it was, indeed, his friendship with President Obama and his even-keel statesmanship that did him in. He had won re-election in 2006 with 87 percent of the vote.
The low-key Lugar's departure leaves the Senate without one of its most experienced foreign policy hands, who leaves a decades-long legacy of reducing risks of nuclear weapons. His most notable accomplishment was his 1992 bill with then-Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to dismantle weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union.
Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear weapons specialist at Stanford University, told us this after Lugar's loss to Mourdock (who himself lost in the general election): Lugar "leaves an incredible legacy, having realized in 1991 that we were threatened more by Russia's weakness than its strength."
Lugar, elected mayor of Indianapolis at 35, also ran briefly for president in 1996.
Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.
In his own words: "Every day Saddam remains in power with chemical weapons, biological weapons and the development of nuclear weapons, is a day of danger for the United States."
Campaigning as the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in 2000, Lieberman, now 70, was the proverbial happy warrior, reveling in the attention lavished on him as the first Jew on a national party presidential ticket.
The crushing way the race ended — in a divided U.S. Supreme Court — dealt the centrist Lieberman a blow from which he seemed to have difficulty recovering. His own presidential campaign fizzled four years later, and soon his hawkish stands put him at odds with his home state party. Thumped by a liberal Democratic primary challenger in 2006, Lieberman ran and won re-election as an independent. Two years later, he would endorse Republican John McCain for president and speak at his nominating convention.
But during much of his four terms in the Senate, Lieberman, a tireless advocate for Israel, also sounded the alarm on global warming, supported the rights of women and gay Americans, and helped create the Department of Homeland Security after the attacks of Sept. 11.
Lieberman's 1998 Senate floor condemnation of President Clinton's dalliance with Monica Lewinsky as "immoral" was seen as a turning point in the controversy.
Despite his tangles with Democrats, Lieberman continued to caucus with the party and supported its positions 87 percent of the time in 2010 — the same year the American Conservative Union gave him a 4 percent rating.
A year ago, in an NPR interview, Lieberman expressed little regret for decisions that infuriated Democrats — and characterized his 2006 Senate win as an independent as the "most gratifying" moment of his political career.

Kenny Engles, cofounder of Curious Brain that today launched a game in partnership with Zynga and Atari. Kenny Engels
The little-known Brooklyn-based Curious Brain today launched Super Bunny Breakout, a game it developed in partnership with Zynga, the leading mobile game developer, and Atari, the granddaddy of the videogaming industry.
"This is a validating event for us," said cofounder and chief executive Kenny Engels in an interview with Upstart Business Journal. Engles said he and his cofounder and wife, Unha Engels have been working to create such large scale rollouts of character-driven games and would eventually like to open up their business model to include merchandising. "That's our future," he said.
Originally known as Touchchords, a mobile music e-learning site, the husband-and-wife cofounders started going by Curious Brain in 2010 when they realized the demand for music education was too small for their ambition, and pivoted into a mobile/social user experience and development agency.
Kenny described the creative culture at Curious Brain as "ambitious, thoughtful, and design-oriented," where, unlike what he calls Internet 1.0 companies that play ping-pong in the lobby, a typical day might include a trip to Makers Faire or an afternoon at the Museum of Modern Art.
Curious Brain's character-driven games for mobile devices were previously based on such franchises as Power Rangers and Angelina Ballerina, as well as on Paul Frank's designs. But he told Upstart the company also does work for WebMD and FedEx Office, though those project aren't on the site.
In the Super Bunny Breakout game, players must rescue critters from “nefarious” Evil Animal Testing (E.A.T.) Labs by passing through 40 physics-based levels. It is available for $0.99 from the App Store on iPhone, iPad, and iPod, with an Android version due to come out.

Kate Fletcher: Using Local Wisdom to Craft Our Use
Kate Fletcher. Photographer: Paige Green
In this interview Urban Times speaks with Kate Fletcher; researcher, writer and design activist. Over the past 15 years Kate has shaped the field of sustainable fashion whether this be through consulting with fashion businesses, the books she has authored and co-authored or teaching at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the London College of Fashion. Kate gives us an insight into the current state of fashion and how far off we are from achieving our sustainability end goal.
What brought you initially to engage with sustainability in fashion?
Being raised in a family of community activists, holidays in wild places and a youth of making clothes.
As a designer, lecturer, campaigner and consultant in sustainable fashion, you wear many hats. Is there a single goal you have in mind?
To contribute to the common good and – to borrow John Ehrenfeld‘s fabulous and evocative word – flourishing.
Having recently spent quite a bit of time in the US, how is the sustainability discussion in fashion different in the US from what it is in the UK and continental Europe?
I would say it is more similar than different – in certain ways Europe steals a march on the US, particularly with the extent to which sustainability is part of discussions in mainstream brands; but in other areas the US is ahead – many of its companies are, for example, key catalysts in the Sustainable Apparel Coalition.
Recently you gave a talk on Designing for Change. Can you give us an idea about what you touched upon and the importance of mastering “the craft of use”?
The talk explored broad ranging themes around fashion and sustainability, including consumerism, and focused on some key ideas such as true materialism and ‘the craft of use’. For me, the craft of use is about the life world of all of us who use clothes, and extending the design process to engage with this in a ‘social context’, in a way which fosters sustainability pleasure, authentic experiences and sustainability values.
What are you hoping to achieve with your ongoing fashion research project, Local Wisdom?
To foster ways of stories, practices, ideas, knowledge and products which generate more satisfying use. So we can and do do more with the stuff we’ve already got.
Lecturing at the LCF, what is the most essential message that you want your students to take away with them?
About the complex, dynamic, interdependent relationships in fashion which they are intrinsically part of…
Local Wisdom, mismatch-buttons. Photographer: Paige Green
Honest By‘s concept of full transparency and traceability is quite unique and is an important step forward. How far are we in the process of maintaining such transparency within all fashion supply chains? What are the biggest hurdles?
A long way … supply chains are dominated by third and fourth tier suppliers … while many brands may know about what happens at the second tier, they are hard pushed to know about what goes on with sub-contractors.
Perhaps one of the biggest problems is scale … things are now so big that trust is eroded … and people are using transparency as a replacement for trust. Which, of course, it is not…
It is quite hard to get hold of contacts of sustainable manufacturers for smaller to medium fashion brands, while designers are reluctant to share such information with peers/competitors. Why is there not more sharing going on?
Perhaps the best way to answer this question is to look at what happens in nature … here there are competitive relationships to be sure, but there are also collaborative ones where different ‘species’ work together to the benefit of the whole. The commercial imperative tends to value only a narrow spectrum of activity – and favours that activity which can be quickly co-opted to deliver economic gain – but new and broader understandings of value need to be developed …
Looking at the bigger picture: Are we getting anywhere at all with the efforts around sustainability in the fashion industry or are we just fighting the symptoms?
I think we are beginning to imagine what a satisfying and flourishing (sustainability) future may be like… but to date most effort goes into just fighting the symptoms.
Finally, do you have 5 top tips for our Urban Times audience looking to join the slow fashion movement?
I just have one tip. It’s not necessarily about slow. But about the right speed.
With thanks to texƧture, our Eco Fashion Strategy partners. texƧture helps players in the textile, fashion and jewellery industry become successful and sustainable businesses by addressing their strategical and operational risks.

IPO market, powered by Facebook, showing signs of life
Investors knew it would take awhile before the IPO market shook off the tech wreck. But not 12 years.

That's how long, though, it's taken for the initial public offering market to show signs of life after the dot-com IPO boom and subsequent spectacular bust.
After being almost comatose for years, the IPO market has hosted 63 deals this year and is expected to launch nine more this week, which would be the best start to a year since 2000, says Renaissance Capital. Add to that the biggest-ever technology IPO, Facebook — which is expected next week — and 2012 looks like the year IPO investors' bruises from the 2000 debacle may finally fade.
STORY: Facebook IPO will be tough for investors to get in on
COLUMN: Ask Matt: Is Apple stock becoming a bubble?
"There's a huge pipeline" of IPOs, says Kathy Smith of Renaissance Capital. "There's lots to choose from for investors."
Even some entrepreneurs say the reception their IPOs are getting exceeded their expectations. "It's a surprise how much demand and interest there was" for the IPO of Infoblox, says CEO Robert Thomas. Shares of Infoblox (BLOX), which helps companies find patterns in corporate data, jumped 33% their first day of trading in April.
The recovery of the IPO market has profound meaning not just for investors in newly public companies, but for the U.S. economy and all its participants. Since the stock market is a main pool of capital that allows companies to fund their expansion, grow and ultimately hire, a robust IPO market is critical to keeping money moving into new ideas. Venture capitalists, too, need a robust IPO market to allow them to cash in on their winners so they can move on to fund the next big idea.
The IPO market is regaining its swagger thanks to a bevy of fortunate coincidences working in concert to give investors the courage to step in and buy.
The strong stock market is perhaps the first prerequisite for an IPO recovery. The value of the Dow Jones industrial average, Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite index has roughly doubled from the low in 2009, notched during the financial crisis. Furthermore, the market's relative tranquility this year is a big help, says Renaissance's Smith. When investors are jittery about huge swings in the stock market, it's difficult for them to feel comfortable putting their money at risk on some of the potentially most volatile stocks available.
The resurgence of the IPO market coincides, too, with a second coming of Internet companies. As was the case in the last IPO boom, investors are dazzled by the seemingly endless opportunity of Internet companies. It was a social-networking stock, Theglobe.com, that kicked off the last IPO boom in 1998. Today, eyes are on big Internet and social-networking companies such as Facebook, Groupon and LinkedIn.
Not deja vu all over again
While the role of tech in both the IPO boom of today and the one ending in 2000 may be notable, IPO observers note that this renaissance is a different animal. Not only are the companies coming public much more seasoned than they were then, investors are much more skeptical .
"The only thing in common between then and now is the word IPO," says John Fitzgibbon of IPOScoop.com.
Specifically, some of the key differences in the IPO market today from the boom time are that this time the deals are:
•Still a far cry from the level of 2000. Having 63 completed deals so far is notable, since it's been years since that many companies have gotten out of the gate this early in the year. And the number of IPOs through April 2012, 58, is the highest during the first four months since 2000. Even so, the deal volume this year pales next to the activity in 2000, when more than 150 IPOs started trading at this point. And this year's IPO activity through Wednesday is a smidgen below the 66 completed IPOs through this point in May 2007, the last time IPO activity spiked higher before hitting rock bottom in 2008.
•Coming from companies with better fundamentals. The companies coming public are much older and more financially sound than they were in 2000. Nearly 70% of the companies coming public today are profitable, Renaissance Capital says, while in 2000 just 30% of the companies with IPOs were making money. Additionally, companies coming public this year have been in business 26 years on average, which is twice the age of the average company making its debut in 2000. "The bar is much higher," says Francis Gaskins of IPOdesktop.com.
•Happening in a different marketplace. Large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, drive the IPO market now as they did then. But in 2000, individual investors played a much more important role on the margins, says Gaskins. While individuals provided buying support for some household-name IPOs at first, such as Groupon, companies must now win over skeptical large investors who demand adequate returns. "The market is very selective," he says.
Meanwhile, many of the smaller investment banks that were aggressive in bringing smaller companies public are gone now, as are some significant larger players, Fitzgibbon says. Firms including Alex. Brown, Montgomery Securities, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Lehman Bros. and Bear Stearns have vanished.
•Subject to heavy discounting. Investors were battling each other to get IPO shares in 2000. Such intense interest caused the average IPO in 1999 to soar 72% on its first day. Many of those investors wound up overpaying and suffered losses as a result. Today, however, IPO prices are being slashed to lure in enough investors. The average IPO has gained 16% the first day. And more than 40% of IPOs have seen their share prices drop below their initial expected range, Renaissance says. That's the most discounting that has been done in the past 10 years, which is as long as Renaissance has tracked the data.
VIDEO: As Facebook prepares for its IPO, analysts say CEO Mark Zuckerberg will not operate the firm the way Wall Street would typically expect.
"There is price sensitivity" now, says Thomas of Infoblox, who took another tech company, NetScreen, public in 2001. Companies and their underwriters are pricing their IPOs at a level that may not attract speculators willing to pay top dollar, and flip, but investors willing to hold the shares longer term, he says.
•Less reliance on a single industry. Roughly 60% of the IPOs in 1999 and nearly half in 2000 were tech or Internet-related, says Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. This year, 33% are, Renaissance says. While that's still a healthy percentage of the deals, there are also 23% from energy and 13% from financials.
Just the beginning?
Optimists say the IPO recovery might just be getting started. The current state of the IPO market resembles 1998, Fitzgibbon says, which was when leading companies such as eBay were testing the IPO market. If top companies go public this year, hold onto their gains and make investors money, expect investment bankers to keep feeding the fire, he says.
There's a huge backlog of companies that have been waiting for precisely this moment and are ready to pounce, Smith says. Demand only continues to mount as investors make money on IPOs. The FTSE Renaissance US IPO Index, which tracks the performance of IPOs for the two years following their first-day closing price, is up 10% this year. That's a solid return, topping the Standard & Poor's 500 index's 7.7% gain.
Some are skeptical, though, that the IPO market can ever return to its heights of 2000. The 152 yearly average number of IPOs from 2000 through 2010 is well below the average of 420 from 1990 through 1999 and even the average 266 from 1960 through 1969, Ritter says.
There have been systemic changes in the ways companies' founders seek to cash in their fortunes, Ritter says. Rather than incurring the costs of going public, many smaller companies see being bought by giants as the end game, Ritter says.

Different kind of bubble?
Selling to a rival can be more profitable, because it saves the smaller company the expense of building its own administrative capabilities, such as a legal department or human resources unit, he says.
Instagram, the online photo software company Facebook bought this year for $1 billion is an example of a company that might have gone public in another era. "There's a bubble, but it's not in the public market," Gaskins says.
Even so, the public markets can offer prices other companies cannot pay or are unwilling to pay, making the IPO still a big draw, Renaissance's Smith says.
If companies continue to successfully go public, it's only a matter of time before others will follow, Fitzgibbon says.
"The good stuff has to really get rolling. If they make it, the competitors come, and that's when the market really gets going."

The:
•Connecticut has increased its tax to $1.51 from 50 cents per pack in 2002. Since then, per capita consumption of cigarettes has fallen 37%.
•New Jersey raised its tax to $2.40 from 80 cents in 2002. Smoking has dropped 35%.
•California raised its cigarette tax to 87 cents per pack in 1999 but hasn't changed it since. Smoking is down 18% since the tax increase.
By comparison, South Carolina has kept its lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax at 7 cents since 1977. Cigarette consumption there has fallen 5% since 2000.
As Congress considers raising the federal cigarette tax to $1 per pack, the nation may be about to experience one of the biggest one-time declines in smoking, health experts and economists say. "I expect a bigger drop than almost anything we've seen before," says Frank Chaloupka, a University of Illinois economist who has studied the effect of taxes on smoking.
He predicts that smoking will drop 6% if the 61-cent-per-pack tax hike is passed, taking the levy to $1 a pack from 39 cents. The Senate last week approved the increase as a way to pay for expanded government health care for children. The House has proposed a 45-cent increase. President Bush has threatened to veto the bill over the increased cost of the health program.
Nationwide, the number of cigarettes smoked fell last year to 1,293 per capita from a peak of 2,095 per capita in 1976, according to "The Tax Burden on Tobacco," an annual industry report. Research shows that health concerns, tax hikes and higher retail prices all have played a role in the decline. Smoking falls 2.5%-5% for every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes, according to the Congressional Budget Office..
"Using taxes to legislate use of a legal product is not good public policy," Briant says.
"Nobody should cry because of lower consumption of a product that kills half the people who use it," says Danny McGoldrick, vice president of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

Prep showdown: No. 2 Aquinas plays host to No. 5 De La Salle
De La Salle (Concord, Calif.) coach Bob Ladouceur doesn't mind facing athletic, higher-ranked teams. He just doesn't like playing them this early. His Spartans, No. 5 in the USA TODAY Super 25 high school football rankings, play at No. 2 St. Thomas Aquinas (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) tonight at 8 (ET) on ESPN2.
By Tamika Moore, AP
St. Thomas Aquinas and linebacker Cole Champion, right, topped Prattville High School and running back Brandon Smith 34-31 in the season opener.

"I'd rather play them at the end of the year, when we're playing our best football," Ladouceur said.
Thanks to its national record of winning 151 consecutive games, set from 1992 to 2004, De La Salle is the standard for elite teams, but St. Thomas Aquinas may be the new standard. When NFL rosters were pared recently, eight former players from Aquinas made the cut, more than any high school in the country.
"Schools like Aquinas and Prattville (Ala.) reload every year," Ladouceur said. "They're one of the best teams I've ever faced. Their defense is stout, strong and athletic. They're well-coached. It's going to be a tough one for us."
Both teams are coming off state championships and are usually better balanced than their opponents. While De La Salle runs more than the typical team from pass-happy California (the Spartans average 178 rushing yards and 82.5 passing yards a game), Aquinas relies on its passing game more (210 yards per game rushing and 129.5 passing) than most run-oriented teams in Florida.
A lot of the numbers clearly favor Aquinas. It has seven players who have offers from major-college schools to only two for De La Salle. The Raiders' record against out-of-state teams is 6-0 (Aquinas has never played a California team) and since 2002, California teams are 4-10 against ones from Florida. De La Salle lost 31-30 to Lakeland in overtime in 2009 in its only matchup against a Florida team.
But the biggest number that may benefit Aquinas is the 3,100 miles De La Salle is traveling to play at Aquinas' Brian Piccolo Stadium. At least, neither team should be intimidated by playing on television. Aquinas opened its season by defeating Prattville, 34-31 in a game on ESPN while De La Salle has frequently played before television cameras. "That could help us," Ladouceur said. "We have a lot of guys going both ways and against a team like Aquinas, we could use the extra timeouts."
Briefly: Andover, Minn., cross country runner Josh Ripley didn't win the Apple Jack Invitational Saturday in Lakeville, Minn., but he earned a lot of respect. Ripley heard Mark Paulauska screaming after the Lakeville South runner had been spiked on his ankle, a wound that would later require 20 stitches. Unlike the other runners before him, Ripley stopped, then carried Paulauska a half mile so he could be attended to. Ripley then continued his race. He'll be honored Monday by the Anoka-Hennepin School Board in Coon Rapids, Minn. … Fairfield Christian (Lancaster, Ohio) senior Hayden Welch accounted for 53 points in the his team's 59-18 football win against Green (Franklin Furnace, Ohio) last Friday. Welch returned two kickoffs and one punt for touchdowns, caught four touchdown passes and made eight extra-points and a 40-yard field goal.

Chairman workforce U.S., which has 125,000 of IBM's 330,000 people.
Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM.
The announcement follows similar plans by other technology companies.
Microsoft said last December that it would double its workforce in India with an investment of $1.7 billion in four years. Around the same time, Intel announced a $1 billion India investment plan, weeks after a group of expatriate Indians said they would spend $3 billion to build a chip-making facility with technology from Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices. Cisco Systems plans to invest $1.1 billion in India over the next three years.
While IBM's operations in India are primarily aimed at bolstering services for clients around the world, the company notes that its revenue within India has grown about 50% annually in each of the past two years.
Even so, IBM's $510 million in revenue from the India market last year, excluding the now-divested PC business, was a small part of the company's $88 billion total.
Bob Djurdjevic, an analyst with Annex Research, said he found IBM's presentations intriguing because they showed the company is not skittish about the topic of offshoring work to India and other developing countries, a subject that became contentious in the 2004 election.
"What IBM is doing is breaking new ground in that sense, by heralding its operations in India boldly and loudly as a success, not something they should be reticent about," Djurdjevic said.
AP Technology Writer Brian Bergstein in Boston contributed to this report.

Although operators in general aren't commutative, the order in which the two operators (bracket terms) are applied to y does not matter in this case because they only differ in a constant factor, which doesn't affect differentiation. This is why this technique requires constant coefficients: If they were functions of x instead, the two operators would no longer commutate, and the analogy with polynomial equations would break down. Because the order in which the two operators are applied doesn't matter, we can split up the 2nd-order equation in two separable 1st-order ones:
Note that k1,2 may be complex.
Linear ODE with constant coefficients of higher order can be solved following the same principle. The number of 1st-order ODEs to be solved is equal to the order of the original equation. The corresponding constants k1,2,3,... are found by finding the roots of the associated auxiliary polynomial.
Armed with that, we can return to solving Laplace's equation.
At this point, you may want to try the second worksheet. Check your solutions when you've finished.

After the script here, dated Oct 27, 2011:
became outdated last fall due to a site revamp, I had to rework it myself when the author wouldn't respond. I posted it in the Issues section of that script at the time:
// ==UserScript==
// @name Slate Single Page View (re-fixed)
// @namespace
// @description Automatically redirects Slate.com article URLs to a single page version if available.
// @include*
// ==/UserScript==
// Get the current window location (URL)
var curLoc = window.location.href;
// Get the html text
var bodyText = document.body.textContent;
if (curLoc.indexOf("single.html") == -1) { //Make sure it's not already singlepage
if (bodyText.indexOf("SINGLE PAGE") != -1) { //Does it think could be repaginated?
var newLoc = curLoc.replace(".html", ".single.html"); //Changes URL to single-page form
window.location.replace(newLoc); //Loads the new page
}
}
And that was working through last weekend, when it suddenly stopped working, not just in Firefox but Opera.
Does anyone know why? Something about the site must have changed to break it, since nothing changed on my end, but I don't know what. The URL format is unchanged. As a test, I even tried getting rid of the conditional lines temporarily so that it would always run, but no go. The conditional logic is not what's tripping it up. It's something with the other lines.
Test URL on the site, but any multi-page article will do:...
to load new page:
var newLoc = curLoc.replace(".html", ".single.html"); //Changes URL to single-page form
window.location.href = newLoc; //Loads the new page

I haven't had much time to look into this, but the "View all photos" has stopped working (changes to "stop loading", but no new photos appear) on albums, but still works on tagged photos.
My best guess is an "&hash=" that's been added to all of the page links of the albums.
If I get a chance, I'll see what else I can find.
--Martin
I've had a go at this ... I think the problem was a combination of the new "First" and "Last" links and also that the format of the page numbers have changed. I'm almost certain there will be more bugs though, but this is working for now. Let me know if you notice anything that's not working.
Working so far - Thanks!
doesn't work for me, the many pages of photos do not load.
hi, i think the script is not working for now. it doesn't load even a single photo.
its looping now for fan photo '-_-7
since i've lost 1.214 photos 'T_T7 and i get this update
:x please dear author :* fix this :)
GREAT REGARD
I have a very busy weekend coming up, but I'll try to find time to do this. What is it not loading for? I believe I have tested for photos of a person and for photos in albums.
hi.... actually i am totally lost that how to use it ..can you please explain..
hi, does this script still work? It used to work great, but now it just starts to load and nothing happens. Thanks for any help.
@JasonJones Facebook natively does album pages now. Tagged photo support is broken. I'm looking at it, but I'm having trouble. Znerp's better than I am, but tends to be pretty busy.
@Martin Stone Thanks for the reply. I hope it can be fixed, it's a great script.
As far as I can see, this script is becoming increasingly redundant. What's not working for you? Any pages that I come across with the (View all photos) link still work fine for me.
For me, Facebook's combining all of the albums into one page, but not for "Photos of ..." pages. (View All Photos) isn't present for me on those. I get:
Error: navLinks is null
Source File:
Line: 56
With some fiddling I got the link to reappear, but when clicked it dies with:
Error: Permission denied for <http: /> (document.domain=<http: />) to call method UnnamedClass.toString on <> (document.domain has not been set).
Error: uncaught exception: unknown (can't convert to string)
This seems to be in the "GM_xmlhttpRequest" bit (from blindly slotting in alerts).
“See this Photo in its Album” is gone in most private facebook albums also "There are no photos to display. Photos of XXX may not have been tagged or may not be visible due to privacy". can you fix this if so will be very grateful
_bugmenot_ : This script won't bypass Facebook's privacy settings.
Hey there, it's been a while so I don't know if you're still working on this, but I've tried out the script and I can get the "Back to Album" to appear above a pic, but nothing happens when I click. It lights up blue when I scroll over it, but I click and nothing. If I right click it doesn't even identify it as a link. It's just a piece of text that acts like a link.
Is a fix still in the works?
mityman50: That functionality is available in stock facebook. I can't remember if that link is there, but if not, click the album name (bottom right). If the album name is not a link, you do not have permission to view that album.
Pressing the "View All Photos" for tagged photos doesn't work, please help!
It doesn't Keep an eye on the new profile - It seems to have this covered. Between that and the new albums page, I think Facebook has this stuff covered.
Thanks, znerp! It's been really useful for me up to now! (and it taught me some things!)

Aaron Horn’s accountability chart—a multi-page matrix outlining goals, tasks, and an hourly schedule—would make all but the most hyper-organized a little nervous.
But Horn EdD ’08, MFT ’12 is convinced that his chart is exactly what the youths at San Francisco’s Youth Guidance Center, the city’s juvenile detention facility, need. A therapist trainee for the Youth Justice Institute and student in USF’s Marriage and Family Therapy Program, Horn works primarily with male youths at the Youth Guidance Center.
“They always tell me, ‘My father’s in jail’ or, ‘My father died.’ A lot of these boys don’t have reliable men in their lives. There’s a lack of integrity, consistency, and organization,” Horn said. “What I try to do is bring consistency to their lives.”
As part of the exercise, Horn has the youths identify accountability partners—people who check in and make sure they do what they say. For many of the youths, Horn plays a hybrid role as accountability partner and therapist, a delicate balancing act, but one to which he is particularly well suited.
Like many of his clients, Horn grew up in Bayview-Hunters Point, a predominantly African American neighborhood plagued by violence and poverty, and was raised solely by his mother and grandmother. That shared background, he says, has been key to nurturing relationships with the youths.
“When they see me come into therapy and I say I grew up in Bayview, that trust almost builds automatically,” he said.
For Horn, the path to becoming a therapist has been circuitous, with stops at local nonprofits and public schools and a five-year stint as an airborne ranger in the U.S. military, which, he says, taught him his signature focus and attention to detail.
It was his passion for educating underserved youth that brought him to USF, where he completed a doctorate in international and multicultural education. His research on the importance of father-like care in the education of young black males underscored what he had observed during his years in the classroom—the lack of available black men to serve as tutors and mentors.
Horn will graduate from USF’s MFT program in July with a new set of tools to serve the youth of his community on a one-on-one level.
“And that’s where I really want to be—working with youth of color as a black male therapist, teaching them to hold each other accountable,” Horn said.

Perceived benefits and barriers to joint protection among people with rheumatoid arthritis and occupational therapists. A mixed methods study.
Niedermann, K, Hammond, A, Forster, A and de Bie, R 2010, 'Perceived benefits and barriers to joint protection among people with rheumatoid arthritis and occupational therapists. A mixed methods study.' , Musculoskeletal Care, 8 (3) , pp. 143-156.Full text not available from this repository. (Request a copy)
Abstract
Background: deciding whether or not to perform a health behaviour is an active decision-making process which has an impact on current and future behaviour and can be influenced by the beliefs both of patients and their healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to explore rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients' and occupational therapists' (OTs) perceptions of the benefits of and barriers to performing joint protection (JP). Methods: a mixed methods design was used. Questionnaires applied a theoretical framework of key themes to assess the relevance of JP benefits and barriers both to people with RA and OTs. Focused interviews with people with RA then enabled data triangulation. Investigator triangulation was used to check the validity of data interpretation. Findings: ten people with RA and nine OTs participated. From the questionnaires, both groups agreed that highly relevant key themes for JP benefits were physical well-being, potential benefit and personal control. By contrast, the three key themes for JP barriers – negative attitude of others, negative impact on others and taking time from other things – were relevant for the majority of the OTs but not patients. The interviews enabled an understanding of the meaning behind RA patients' ratings, particularly their differences from OTs. People with RA explained JP benefits, and disease acceptance had altered some initial barriers into perceived benefits over time. Conclusions: emphasizing benefits and identifying individually relevant barriers could be an important communication strategy for OTs in understanding patients' rationale for whether or not to adopt JP methods.

Old Drug Gets A Second Look For TB Fight
Originally published on Thu October 18, 2012 11:04 am.
This kind of TB, called XDR-TB because it's extensively drug-resistant, is a lot harder to treat than multiple drug-resistant TB, or MDR-TB, a type that's unfazed by first-line drugs. A recent report from the World Health Organization estimates that 310,000 people have MDR-TB, most of them in India, China and the Russian Federation.
While XDR-TB is worse, MDR-TB is bad enough, says Dr. Kenneth Castro of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "All of a sudden you switch from being able to cure someone in 6 months to requiring 2 years of treatment and lowering your ability to cure, using lousy and toxic drugs," he says.
About 1 in 10 people with drug-resistant TB have the more severe XDR type. Eighty-four countries have seen cases of XDR-TB, although most of them have counted fewer than 10 cases so far. There are nearly 9 million new cases of all types of TB globally each year, and 1.4 million deaths.
Drug-resistant TB is a growing problem and a flashing neon sign of what happens when people don't get prompt and proper treatment for ordinary TB.
"One of the major reasons for MDR-TB is inadequate treatment of plain old TB," say Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "And one of the drivers of XDR-TB is inadequate treatment of MDR-TB."
Fauci and Castro spoke at a Washington press conference on Wednesday to mark the WHO's annual TB update.
The linezolid study, conducted in South Korea, suggests that even the most-difficult-to-treat form of TB may be curable most of the time. Patients have to take the drug along with others for 6 months and health workers have to make sure they're complying. That, of course, is no foregone conclusion in places with the worst XDR-TB problem, countries such as Tajikistan, Azerabijan and Belarus.
And, as with everything TB-related, the good news about linezolid comes with a dark side. There's a high incidence of serious side effects such as nerve toxicity and bone marrow suppression, which caused several patients to drop out of the study. And a few patients developed resistance to this antibiotic, too, though fewer than feared.
The linezolid report isn't the only encouraging news. The TB drug pipeline contains 10 other new or repurposed drugs, and two or three may get U.S. market approval in the coming year, says Dr. Mario Raviglione of the WHO's Stop TB program.
"Initial trials are showing that the capacity to kill bacteria resistant to the most important drugs is dramatically increased," Raviglione says.
The new drugs have been tested so far only in patients with MDR-TB, but Raviglione hopes they might ultimately be used as first-line treatment for TB that could shave months of the standard six-month regimen.
Millions of TB patients wouldn't progress to the MDR or XDR stages if they got treated promptly and correctly in the first place. And that's where another recent advance comes in.
It's called GeneXpert, a rapid diagnostic test that can tell in under 2 hours if someone has TB and if it's a drug-resistant form. Standard tests rely on growing the TB bacteria in the lab, which can take up to 8 weeks for results.
Castro says prompt diagnosis of TB is a big boon. "In the same day, you should be able to identify TB and start the patient on treatment," he says. "That is a game-changer."
Sixty-seven low- and middle-income countries have adopted GenXpert, and experts hope its use will expand rapidly due to a recent price cut for lower-income countries from around $17 per test to under $10.
In the future, Fauci is confident there will be an effective vaccine against TB. More than a dozen are in development.
But for all progress, the fight against TB remains a long slog. Patients have to be diagnosed, started on treatment, monitored and retained in treatment. Drugs have to be procured and distributed. Labs have to be built and their quality maintained.
It can be done. Over the past 17 years, 51 million people around the world have been successfully treated for TB. Consequently, the TB death rate has gone down by 41 percent. The world as a whole is on track to cut TB deaths by half the 1990 rate by 2015 – although Africa and Europe will miss that target.
But even though new cases of TB are falling at a rate of 2.2 percent annually, Raviglione says "that's far too slow to see elimination in this century."
He fears the campaign to stop TB will stagnate "if additional resources are not urgently mobilized."
The WHO says $8 billion a year is needed over the next three years for TB care and control. That's $3 billion more than donors have promised. Research and development has a $1.4 billion funding gap.

March 25, 2011— Some 40 University of Wisconsin-River Falls students recently participated in a Pay It Forward Tour program, a dynamic multi-day program focusing on service, education and reflection.
The Pay it Forward Tour is through UWRF’s Student’s Today Leaders Forever (STLF) chapter, a non-profit organization that reveals leadership through service, relationships and actions. A chapter of STLF was established at UWRF in 2010.
The students traveled the country and volunteered in a new city each day. This year the Pay It Forward Tour ended in Denver, Colo. Before arriving in Denver, the students stopped in Fargo, N.D., Miles City, Mont., Rapid City, S.D., Casper, W.Y. and Alliance, Neb.
In Miles City, the group prepared to turn the Miles City Hockey Rink into a rodeo arena, including tearing down bleachers, getting rid of the ice as well as cleaning the space.
See Vang, a sophomore pre-major from Mosinee, is a core leader of UWRF’s chapter.
“The Miles City Youth Hockey Association had donated money towards our service trip and remarked that they were thankful for the service that we provided to them that day because what we had done in two hours would normally take them ten days,” says Vang.
In Rapid City, they volunteered their time at Mt. Rushmore National Park removing infested trees. In Alliance, the students helped at the Alliance Middle School where they gave a presentation about bullying.
Many university students go somewhere warm for their spring break, but these members took it upon themselves to give back.
Lee Thao, a freshman English major from St. Paul, Minn., says, “This trip has changed me a lot. Before I did not open up to anyone, but with this experience I have now opened up and have met many people.”
The STLF chapter at UW-River Falls hopes to expand in size in the future and have more participants in the service trips.
“The experience has changed my life. From being a participant in the organization a year ago, to now becoming a chapter core leader, it has really helped my leadership abilities. I would recommend this experience to anyone,” says Jessica Ryan, a sophomore biology major from Whitehall.
For more information on STLF, contact Vang at see.vang@uwrf.edu
or Gina Sevick, adviser, at gina.sevick@uwrf.edu
or call 715-425-3531.

What is a vaginal mesh? When is it used?
The Vaginal Mesh,Surgical Mesh Trans vaginal mesh.prolapse mesh and vaginal sling are medical devices designed to strengthen vaginal wall. The device is usually implanted after a woman experiences a pelvic organ prolapse or a POP,after child birth,hysterectomy or SUI urinary incontinence. A Pelvic Organ Prolapse occurs typically due to pregnancy,age,hysterectomy,injury or other medical condition causing the vaginal wall to weaken. The pelvic organ prolapse occurs when an organ drops and pushes against the wall of the vagina. The organs that can drop are the bladder, urethra, uterus, small bowel. Mild POP can be treated with special excerises. More severe POP cases are treated with Transvaginal mesh devices.
There are four types of Transvaginal mesh implant products. There is *a non-absorbable polyester or polypropylene,* absorbable synthetics transbvaginal mesh product,* animal tissues mesh product, and *combinations of the above. The Vast majority of surgons use the polyester or polypropylene Transvaginal mesh. Manufacturers are required to report any adverse complications from their products. The Transvaginal mesh products used for prolapse repair, or for urinary stress incontinence surgery.have shown to cause severe complications.

300.000 women have been treated for organ prolapse. More than 75,000 women received vaginally implanted Transvaginal mesh implants last year to reinforce weak pelvic muscles that have failed to support internal organs. "We listen to stories of these complications on a daily basis " "The 510(k) process which approves or disapproves medical devices has completely failed to protect these thousands of women who were advised these implanted vaginal mesh devices would improve their quality of life" "A panel met just recently to review the safety of these devices. The FDA must move forward to protect women."says L.Spitzer MSW who oversees the Vaginal Mesh Helpline.

The company has given no explain of its decision, but Dennis Romero of LA Weekly believes the decision may be a result of businesses complaining about the credit cards they issue to employees being used to purchase marijuana. Ilana Greene of Business Insider added that American Express may have received a high number of fraudulent charges from medical marijuana dispensaries, thanks to thieves using stolen cards to try to buy marijuana.

The Cohen Commission report found no primary reason for decline in salmon stocks
The long-awaited report about declining Fraser River sockeye stock during the past two decades was released Wednesday, but the findings couldn’t narrow down a main cause for the drop.
“The idea that a single event or stressor is responsible for the 1992 to 2009 decline in Fraser River sockeye is appealing but improbable,” wrote report author Bruce Cohen, a B.C. Supreme Court justice.
“Factors in the marine environment appear particularly implicated in the broad-based regional decline of salmon stocks. Regrettably, that is as far as the evidence takes me.”
The report also cautioned that the 2010 and 2011 rebound of adult salmon returning to spawn — based on preliminary data — was not complete evidence that stocks have returned to historic levels.
The numbers from the previous two years show levels similar to what was seen in the 1950s, a drastic improvement from the all-time low in 2009.
“The year 2010 was one of abundance: 29 million sockeye returned to the Fraser River,” Cohen wrote.
“However, while demonstrating the sockeye’s capacity to produce at historic levels, this dramatic improvement in a regular peak year in the four-year life cycle of sockeye did not point to a reversal of the long-term decline.”
Among the commission’s 75 recommendations, it’s asked the government to balance farmed salmon and its wild counterpart, and suggested there’s a risk the Department of Fisheries and Oceans would “favour the interests of the salmon-farming industry” over wild stocks.
It also recommends better monitoring of fish health, including minimizing risk that farmed salmon could introduce “exotic diseases” and cause serious or irreversible damage.
The full report can be found at cohencommission.ca.

Since I am too lazy at the moment to edit my two draft posts waiting in the wings, I am going to post an essay I wrote some years ago about language. I wrote it as a blog post during an early and mostly unsuccessful experience with blogging, at a time when my stories were just starting to be published. I still stand by what it says, although it is somewhat fancifully written.
I’m posting it because I have been thinking of SF written in India in different languages and the tension between English and other Indian languages (and yes, by now English is an Indian language) and the nastiness of language politics often obscuring the real issues — all this partly as a result of an email conversation with SF Hindi writer and fan Dr. Arvind Mishra (who also very kindly directed me to a marvelous device: the Google Hindi transliteration tool जिसकी सहायता से मुझे अब हिंदी में लिखने का मौका मिल रहा है).
While I ponder the implications of that conversation I thought it might be fun to post the aforementioned essay (very minimally edited). It appeared some years ago in a very interesting Indian ezine (will post link when I remember what it was called). So here goes.
Two Near-Drowning Experiences
Once, I nearly drowned. My near-death experience took place several years ago when I was a graduate student in the U.S. Eleven of us Indian graduate students had decided to go canoeing in a local river. I remember at first I hesitated because I did not know (then) how to swim, but my friends assured me blithely that with ten other people around there was no way I could drown. So I went.
It was a lovely afternoon and the river was small and surprisingly swift. We got canoes from some kind of rental place and I found myself in a two-seater with the aforementioned friend’s boyfriend, a rather awkward situation. I think they had had a spat and she walked off with some other guy, and since I was the odd one out and the only non-swimmer, I ended up with Friend’s Boyfriend and a cooler filled with beer bottles. At first the going was smooth and exhilarating, and we sped swiftly between tall banks overgrown with wildflowers and mossy earth. Taking a swift turn around a bend, we did not see the tree branch that hung low over the water. It neatly swept us off the canoe.
As I went down I saw the beer cooler floating away and my friend’s boyfriend swimming frantically after it. The next thing I knew, the water had closed over my head and I was being carried by the current. Time slowed; I willed myself not to breathe. I seemed strangely detached from that part of me that was screaming silently in terror; as I went down, I saw, in the clear depths, the pebbly bottom of the river. When my feet touched bottom I used all my strength to push off. My head cleared the surface; in that blessed, frantic moment I breathed. In that instant I saw the river’s surface at eye-level: the sweep of the water, a low, sandy beach on the opposite side, and a high bank not far from me — then I was going down again into the luminous depths of the river. I used the technique of bouncing off the river-bed — and flailing my arms — until I reached the bank, where I held on desperately to shrubs growing on the vertical rise. The river gurgled and breathed, chuckling to itself with its watery tongues, as I waited for rescue.
They eventually remembered me and rescued me. The guys formed a chain across the river and helped me across to the sandy beach, cracking jokes and trying to reassure me that I was all right. But I no longer trusted canoes, or certain kinds of men. Having acquired this unexpected intimacy with the river, I chose to sit in the middle of a tire, alone, and go tubing down the river. And for the rest of that trip there were no more mishaps. But I was taking no chances after that experience. I signed on for a swimming course as soon as I could, and although I don’t swim particularly well, the water is no longer an enemy.
I had another drowning experience many years later, which recalled the earlier one, except that the element in question was not water but… words. I was in the bookstore with my husband and daughter, where we were indulging in our favorite vice — browsing among the bookshelves, picking out books to buy. At one point I found myself standing alone in one of the aisles — the shelves towered above me, the spines of the books hinting at the worlds inside them — and I felt myself being slowly submerged in a great tidal wave of Johns and Marys, Garys and Gertrudes, and they seemed to be chattering away about their lives, their adulterous couplings in American suburbia, their wanderings on far planets where they sipped their martinis and dreamed of New New York, their adventures, their emptiness, their fulfillments. They muttered and laughed and enunciated their particular varieties of English — Roman letters came tumbling out of the pages of their books, swooping at me like paper planes, gathering like clouds before a storm, breaking over my head, mating in mid-air to form sentences that hovered around my face. English. English names, idioms, thoughts, ideas. The first thing that came to my mind as I stood there, drowning, was Alice in Wonderland, the scene at the end where the cards are coming down around her like rain, and she opens her eyes to find leaves falling on her face. I remembered Alice, not Anamika. I thought, stupidly, where is she, Anamika? Where is her voice? Where are the Rams and Jyotis and Raghunathans and Kabirs and Mallikas? Where are the syllables and scripts of Hindi and Tamil and Urdu, where are they?? I am in a country where they speak English, a language that is no stranger to me — I learned it as a child only a year or two after I learned Hindi — and I am drowning in a sea of words and ideas that are essentially English or at least Western. How do I tell someone, in affectionate exasperation, धत तेरी की जय हो? There is no translation that can do it justice, no equivalent in a Western language.
And the problem is not entirely one of a stranger in a strange land, because in New Delhi, India, there are, I suspect, more English-language bookstores than Hindi. Let English propagate, I have no quarrel with that — but must it plow over Hindi to do that? I am not a Hindi fanatic — every language, after all, is a powerful and different way of holding a mirror up to the world — what I want is a multiplicity of tongues. Not a Darwinian, imperialistic sweeping aside of cultures and languages, but old women chattering in backyards, learning words from each other, spawning new idioms and expressions, keeping their languages alive by speaking them in the fertile soil of a true and diverse cultural congress.
Despite the prevalence of English in the big cities and in the lives of the middle class intelligentsia, in India I didn’t feel I was drowning. I went to an English medium school, too. But Hindi was everywhere. We spoke it at home, along with English, and we spoke it with relatives, and the vegetable seller, the milkman, the cook. There were Hindi movies, and there were visits to relatives in small towns, and there was music, and myth, and the vastness and variety of one of the world’s most ancient cultures. Language reflected culture reflected language.
When I was a child we used to go every summer to Bihar, our home state, to stay with my grandparents. We would take the train from New Delhi Railway Station, a cavernous, cacophonous place where everything and everyone was in a hurry. Sitting in the train compartment, at last, breathing sighs of relief, we would buy cups of fragrant sweet chai from vendors. The cups were earthen ones that you threw out of the window when you were done, returning earth to earth. The tea inside them was pale brown and smoky with the tang of clay. The shouts of the vendors echoed on the train platforms, the train began to slide out of the station, and we left behind the earthy, Punjabi-influenced accents of Delhi Hindi. Going east, the accents of the people on the platform would become softer and more sing-song. By the time we got to Eastern Uttar Pradesh, as twilight fell, we could hear the tender accents of Bhojpuri, the native dialect of my parents. The language is so sweet to the ear that it needs no words like “please.” I used to understand some Bhojpuri once, but now all I remember are the songs my mother taught us. पाक गैले खेतवा, जरन लागे रेतवा sung at about the same rhythm as the swaying beat of the train. In the early morning I would be woken by a strange stillness; the train would be at some small station in Bihar, and the chai garam calls of the vendors, the smell of coal dust and hot, sweet, milky tea would rouse me from my bunk. Here morning was no longer subah but bhore and “why” wasn’t the snappy kyoon but the more relaxed, multi-tonal kaahe. By the time we reached our destination, Patna, it would seem almost as though Time itself had slowed. People on the platform seemed less rushed, the train would have acquired some of the languor of the air, and speech would have become melody. We would all lean precariously out of the doorway as the train drew in, searching the sea of faces for my grandfather, who would be somewhere at the back of the crowd, straight-backed and smiling benignly. Outside, amid the confusion of car horns and dust and rickshaws pulled by turbaned men with lean brown bodies, we would find my grandparents’ grey Fiat, a car they had owned for some twenty years or more. End of journey, beginning of summer. Time to argue over which variety of mango was superior, the pale, narrow, firm-fleshed dashehri we got in Delhi or the huge, golden digha malda, King of Mangoes, grown only in a few groves in Bihar. Time for lassi and nimbu pani and other cooling drinks churned at home by cooks or chattering aunts.
The irony of bemoaning in English the loss of my connection with native tongues is only too apparent to me. It is something I am constantly aware of; yet it was only after that surreal experience at the bookstore that I realized the extent of the loss. I went home and brooded on this for a few days. Then my music teacher mentioned a house concert, where a renowned exponent of North Indian Classical music, touring from India, was going to sing. We went.
The long room at our host’s house had been cleared of all furniture, and was covered by rugs. Panditji sat at one end, with his flock of accompanists and a cluster of microphones. I could hear at least three different languages — not including English — being spoken. Women in bright saris or salwaar kameez, men in crisp kurta-pajamas, sat on the rugs facing the master, while small children played in the next room or came in to sit on their parents’ laps for a moment. When the music started, a slow, gorgeous piece in raag bageshri, I felt like a fish that has been tossed back into its river. It was pure enchantment. The syllables, rendered effortlessly by the master, flowed around us, reverberated in the long room, made the children pause in their play. I sat next to my teacher and one of her other students, and we listened the way thirsty people drink water. For me the crowning moment came later, when the singer sang a piece in raag desh that I had once learned from my sister: a description of monsoon clouds that gather to provide succor after a long, scorching summer, and the call of the papiha, that sits in the deepest arboreal grottos and sings its heart out. Meha re, went the song, meha re, ban ban, daar daar, murla bole… Then a slow, melodious enunciation of the word meha, the cloud, drawing out the syllables toward the higher notes with such passion that it brought tears to the eyes. I could almost hear the rain pattering outside the window.
It has been a while since that experience. Since then, I have taken to re-reading my 8 volumes of stories by the great Hindi writer Premchand. I make it a point to talk in Hindi with my Hindi-speaking friends as much as I can. And while I still listen to music from around the world, I make sure it includes a weekly dose of desi stuff: from Bhimsen Joshi to film songs, from the folk music of Himachal to the qawalis of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. These temporary immersions are no substitute for traveling on a slow train across the Indian countryside, for arguing over the best mangoes with my cousins, for helping my grandmother feed the wild birds in her garden. But they help me catch my breath.
It makes me smile, though, when I remember the experience in the bookstore, and the concert some days after, that what saved me from drowning was a song about the watery abundance of the monsoons. Life is full of the most unexpected connections.

To comment on one small slice of your essay: in recent history, the English speaking world, specifically the US, was seen as the technologically advanced, up-and-coming, get-things-done culture. Some decades ago there was a small collection published of short stories by European authors. It was small because there were so few. The introduction quoted one Italian author, who gave his characters American names, as saying he did so because no-one would believe Italian characters in SF.
That’s changing. The future is here, as someone said, it’s just not everywhere. Well, _that_ future is becoming more everywhere.
Unfortunately, there’s little hope that an Indian author, writing in Hindi, would have a market in the US. But translations, however inadequate, will someday bring those ideas to these shores. What’s needed is more Indian, and Chinese, and Farsi, and, yes, Italian, writers, creating works that cry out for translation. What’s also needed is a genuine Indian voice — Younguncle writ large — that can create a new wave, to follow on to the New Wave, and New Weird, SF&F. Something for you to work on during your summer vacation.

Photo by Don Ryan/AP UNLV guard Anthony Marshall, left, goes to the basket past Portland guard David Carr during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in Portland, Ore., Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2012.
The next time someone tries to downplay Mike Moser's importance to the 2012-13 Runnin' Rebels, tell them to pop in a tape of Tuesday night's game at Portland.
Without its junior leader, UNLV looked completely lost in the first half. The offense was a wreck — and not even a trainwreck, as that would be too kind. It was more like a shipwreck, sunk to the bottom of the ocean and being picked at by the fish. The Rebels shot 24.2 percent in the first half, with six assists and seven turnovers. They hit just 1-of-15 3-pointers and trailed, 28-22 at the break.
But just like that, the Rebels flipped a switch and turned it around in the second half. Led by white-hot shooting from Justin Hawkins and a gritty all-around effort from Anthony Marshall, they blew past Portland and held on for a 68-60 win. Let's dissect the victory with a "Fast Breakdown."
FAST BREAKDOWN
Port-Land of Confusion
If there's anything worse than referencing a Genesis song from 1986 in a headline, it was the Rebels' first-half performance in Portland. The numbers were bad enough (see the intro above if you're a true masochist), but the general sense of confusion was the most disconcerting thing. Moser was sorely missed, as the Rebels lacked structure and reverted back to jacking up quick 3's, without much success. Even with Anthony Bennett beasting (11 first-half points), there was no consistent effort to get the ball inside. If there was any message to draw from the first half, it would probably be: Hurry back, Mike.
Second-half surge
Despite the slow start, there are some definite positives to take away from this game. For instance, last year this would have almost certainly been a loss. UNLV was poor on the road last season, collapsing at the first sign of trouble. And this much adversity (no Moser, foul trouble for Bennett, poor shooting) would have been too much to overcome. But the Rebels showed great fortitude in the second half, led by senior leaders Justin Hawkins and Anthony Marshall (31 combined points). The backcourt duo played tremendous defense, and Hawkins erased the deficit virtually by himself once he got hot from 3-point land. No matter the opponent, it's never easy to come back on the road and win. Give UNLV credit for showing mental toughness and grinding this one out.
Justin Hawkins, Superhero
The Rebels were struggling mightily to put points on the board, but Hawkins single-handedly took care of that in the second half. The senior guard drilled four 3-pointers after halftime, and at one point scored 11 straight points to give UNLV the lead for good. He finished with 15 points, three steals, three assists and two blocks in 28 minutes, and that stat line doesn't even do him justice. Hawkins gets my game ball.
Zoning out
I expect to see Dave Rice to spend a lot of time on breaking the zone in upcoming practices. The Rebels haven't been good against zone, and with their struggles from outside (just 6-of-25 against Portland), they're going to see more and more of it as the season goes on. Bryce Dejean-Jones and Katin Reinhardt were quick on the trigger, with little success — Dejean-Jones was 0-of-9 from the floor and 0-of-6 from 3-point range, while Reinhardt finished 2-of-10 and 0-of-4 from 3. That's no way to break a zone, especially when you have Anthony Bennett (18 points, 6-of-11 FGs) roaming the middle.
What does it mean?
A win is a win, especially on the road. Just keep repeating that and you'll feel better. Even though UNLV turned it around in the second half and really played some good basketball, the fact remains that we're seven games into the season and we still haven't seen the Rebels play a full 40 minutes. With another road game at Cal looming on Sunday, we won't have to wait long to see how they respond. Cal is 6-1 and coming off their first loss (at Wisconsin), so the Bears will probably be fired up and come flying out of the gate. If the Rebels stumble early again, they may not be able to overcome it — with or without Moser.

RelationshipsFML: Overcoming Shyness (for women)
Posted by Some Dude on April 18, 2012 at 11:40 am girl, what can you do to overcome that reluctance? And if you’re a guy interested in (or already in a relationship with) a shy girl, how do you deal with it?
For afflicted women: you’re a lot better off than shy men, for starters. Shyness in women plays well to old notions of gender roles that die hard, so unlike men, taking advantage of your own shyness is an effective option. Overcoming it outright is a bit harder but also works very well, and is more empowering in the long run.
One important step in breaking the shyness logjam is to stop dwelling so much on others’ reactions. Recognize that you’re never going to be able to perfectly interpret nonverbal cues – no one can. Rapt attention to others’ nonverbal cues often leaves you not focusing enough on your own nonverbal cues. So instead of trying to detect hairsplitting subtlety, you’re much better off focusing your effort on getting others to give you obvious signs of their interest. And you do that by amping up the attraction.
You can use shyness to your advantage by playing up femininity. It works because guys find it attractive in and of itself, and it strongly contrasts guys’ masculinity, which can even make even shy guys feel comfortable (and therefore less shy). To do this, you first need to make sure that the passive ingredients to your attractiveness are the best they can be. This includes obvious things like dressing to flatter your body type, an appropriate hairstyle, and simple makeup. It also includes less obvious things like posture, hygiene, tone of voice, and so on. I go into these things in a lot more detail in this post. Then, you just need to be visible. One of the best ways for naturally shy women to express interest is simple eye contact. That single, simple step is easily manageable despite shyness, and is very effective. Your shyness won’t hold you back in conversation, because (thanks to ingrained gender roles) your bashfulness at worst won’t hurt you and at best can be very endearing.
Overcoming shyness works much as it does for guys: knowing that you’re doing something right gives you the confidence to continue doing it right, which will give you results, but the reason it works is a little different. For guys, confidence itself makes them seem more attractive; for women, confidence allows you to cast a wider net by being comfortable entering new social environments and approach specific individuals you find interesting. So, how to do it? In time you may find that using your shyness to your advantage will give you the confidence to overcome it naturally. Something else which will help you is improving your ability with smalltalk, which has wide applications outside of relationships; I became comfortable with smalltalk by reading a self-help book, but there are many paths to improving this skill. The essence of smalltalk is to have a conversation that the other party finds enjoyable and engaging. To that end, asking questions and listening well are more important than being confident talking about yourself, which if you’re shy makes mastering smalltalk easier than it might seem.
For guys interested in shy girls: Simply put, be obvious. Just kiss her already, dumbass. It can be scary, especially for shy guys, to just dive in, but diving in is infinitely better than endlessly circling and waiting for the perfect sign or moment – for much the same reason I gave above for women. There is no special approach to shy girls that is distinct from any other girls.

It was 1993. I was in middle school.
Kids can be cruel? Absolutely. In 1993, it was my turn to be cruel. But understand, it wasn’t my fault. I lost a bet and it was either do my job or get laughed at. So I chose to do my job.
Here’s some backstory though.
In 1993, I was in 8th grade. Yes, that makes me older than you. But so what, you can’t whip my arse! Anyway, back then I was that kid everybody hated. Not because I was a bad person, but because I was “that” dude. I was on all the sports teams (basketball, cross country, track-n-field), got straight A’s, and was the student government president.
I was also like 4’11″. Real talk, I didn’t grow until my junior year of high school. I thought I was going to be a midget. This was a very real fear. It didn’t turn out to be reality but I still can’t dunk a basketball. Thanks mom.
Anyway, there was a young lady who came to my school JUST for her 8th grade year. We’ll call her Sonia. That’s not her name. But it is today. I don’t remember much about Sonia short of her jheri curl. And I only remember that because she smelled like activator. That’s not a dis or a shot, it’s just the truth. It was the kind of curl that almost made you want to light a math to see if it was as flammable as you thought. Poor Sonia, jheri curl, glasses, and pretty sizeable gap in her front two teeth.
For the record, I don’t think a gap is a bad thing. In fact, I think it builds character. Word that up. The look just doesn’t work for everybody. Word that up too.
Anyway, Sonia took a shining to yours truly. I’m not sure why, but she wanted to lay her curl on my pillow…something that I just was not feeling. At all. But she liked me. Awwww.
Well, Sonia ALSO (along with her curl) had some pretty consistently stank mouth. I tried not to pay it too much attention but we sat near each other in Math class. Point is, I got firsthand accounts and experience in her mouth.
Pause.
Or not pause.
Well, one day I made a bet with some other chicks in our math class. I don’t remember the bet at all. Not even a little bit. I do remember that the loser had to give Sonia a pack of breathmints at the SGA party we had going on later that night. I lost.
This presented a bit of difficulty for me seeing as I viewed Sonia as a friend. And she liked me. And here I had to be the bearer of bad news at a public event no doubt. You see where this is going right?
Later on in that evening the party gets going. The sounds of Vanilla Ice and Color Me Badd rock the auditorium when I decide to make my move. See, back then, I had to save face. I couldn’t just get punked into NOT calling somebody out on their bad breath. Oh, how shortsighted was I.
At the party I pulled Sonia into a corner where everybody could see us and then I pulled out the breathmints and gave them to her. In the entire realm of my life, that is one day I felt truly terrible to embarass somebody who did nothing wrong ever.
In the coming weeks and months, we didn’t talk much. She never let that go and I can’t blame her. She just quietly seethed towards me with her jheri curl causing a water hazard all around her desk.
In the most random twist of fate ever, I saw her in Huntsville, Alabama one day. My sister and I ventured to the local military base and upon walking into the door, there was Sonia. Still the same height, still rocking a jheri curl. And that last part is still true.
She recognized me right away and we struck up a short but awkward conversation. In fact, she was so shook that when I asked her what she was doing in Alabama, she told me that she was taking classes at the University of Georgia Tech. To this day I still can’t find any school labeled as such. My little sister immediately busted out laughing.
And I feel bad. I truly wish I’d handled that situation differently, but apparently it wasn’t in me to do so. I embarassed the hell out of this girl for no good reason.
But its in the past so the only thing that I can do is not mess with women with jheri curls.
I have no idea what she’s doing now but I”m guessing it involves DeVry. Which is totally great! Yeah. Okay. Alright.
Anyway, I shared that story to say that I’m learning that I need to say “I’m sorry”. She doesn’t read this blog so she’s short. But maybe one day she will and she’ll come across this post.
I needed to come clean. For the children. I’m sorry Sonia.
So good folks of VSB, what do you feel guilty for doing or do you need to say “I’m sorry” for? I know you got soul.

More women than men are applying for veterinary school—making up as much as 80 percent of applicants at some schools. That's not because men are avoiding perceived lower wages in veterinary medicine, says one researcher. It's because male applicants are avoiding fields filled with women.
That's the conclusion of Anne Lincoln, an assistant sociology professor at Southern Methodist University, whose study of the changing face of veterinary medicine is the first to look at gender in college applications from 1975 to 1995. Lincoln used decades of surveys and application information shared by the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges in her recently published study, "The Shifting Supply of Men and Women to Occupations: Feminization in Veterinary Education," in the journal Social Forces.
In addition to men's "preemptive flight" from female-dominated colleges, Lincoln also attributes veterinary medicine's gender shift to women's higher graduation rates from college as well as the landmark 1972 federal amendment that prohibited discrimination by gender in college applications. Women have been enrolling in college in greater numbers since 1972, according to Lincoln.
In her study, Lincoln controlled for class size, percentage of women on faculty and in the classroom, increased tuition, and declines in veterinary medicine's average salary, and found that none of those factors were statistically significant in explaining why more women than men were applying.
Instead, Lincoln attributes the change in the veterinary profession's gender to the "preemptive flight" of men, who may be uncomfortable with the fact that veterinary medicine is dominated by women or see a much larger proportion of women on veterinary college campuses during school visits.
Lincoln says the evidence proves false the notion that women enter less lucrative fields, like veterinary medicine, because their husbands can support them with larger salaries. Men and women seem equally affected by salary and tuition concerns, she says.
Of course, with growing numbers of female graduates, veterinary medicine isn't the only field in for a gender shift. Based on current application and enrollment data, Lincoln says medicine and law—traditionally male-dominated fields—will follow veterinary medicine's lead in the next 20 to 30 years.

Well joining me now Mike -- president founder of the Holland balanced fund great to have you with us and to be here.
You know we're watching this market -- it seems like day after -- we're talking about a -- now some late.
We're seeing.
Firming in this market what's going on now well.
The valuations who have had such low levels or stocks worldwide.
Prices of so called risk free assets -- treasury bonds of earth if it's such high levels.
Now when we get good news or bad news you don't get the same reactions we've had before two because yes such extremes priced it.
People are so nervous skeptical cynical about anything that's going on right now.
That the prices are now reflecting that so when you do get bad news if you're not getting big down would move in the stock market when you do get.
You know some some decent news like he had housing did -- get things moving -- It it appears to many that there is a bottom forming here at least in the house are confident about the stock market.
-- what what is your read.
I think both are possible and probably likely and I think the reason for that is once again.
We hit levels of -- since 2008.
Where no one -- is unaware of the houses have been had a good investments since 2000.
No one is unaware that stocks have been -- lousy investment for the last ten years it -- the most people are going to sell those things they sold.
And you have a very very very low ownership of stocks and also people interest in housing up until this point I think prices are there.
And are looking at all of the of the external right now that the face investors this market.
The European Union summit do you expecting -- to come up -- is that does something to to our cal law.
Conventional wisdom once again totally skeptical totally apathetic and to -- best.
The results out of this thing could be -- some comment about the banking union which they consider later that would be a positive surprise because nobody expects anything good.
More important next week the European Central Bank meets.
When they meet next week if they did anything positive read that.
They said something about lowering rates and doing more content -- do so.
That would actually be surprised the markets that would once again be he probably that would be a surprise in the upside -- former -- comments such as she thinks.
But they've done really quite enough and hello everybody starts self fulfilling their promises for the the money that they've received all of those bailouts.
Do they shall hold steadfastly to that viewers this up.
Posturing in advance of -- European Union summit.
You think she might be actually.
Act like a politician artwork but.
Which she is in their -- he does have to posture.
And I think it's a great question because she in fact is probably going to be doing a little more accommodating -- -- hard come answered me.
You know that they wouldn't she she had this coming in her lifetime to never -- and instead it's never.
But you're you're gonna happen if -- -- out of her life I think I'm perforated effect that pray that it the up.
I'm in -- where it goes into the Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner who -- forgot his name was.
We haven't heard from.
We're in the midst of what everybody including.
The -- -- himself has said.
Is a major global crisis and he is.
They were visible -- -- what what it's going -- I think we have in Washington right now only Ben Bernanke to look toward.
And that's scary because they've just about shut -- whole.
Ammunition did that they have he says there's some of the things they can do you and he had Richard Fisher yesterday telling them fox noise -- Viewers that he thinks it.
We were just about does Iraq it's a -- and now these other people have to do something.
That which again is the potential good news going out over the next six to twelve months that we will getting major change in the people who leading -- we may get some leadership.
And if we do no one expects that.
It's certainly not in anyone's pricing.
And just give us your best.
Assess what likely will be the impact if -- Eric Holder is cited for contempt of congress.
And Obama carriers reward constitution.
I believe the stock market will go.

On the part of the storm the smoke it's just the storm is something else.
We'll say these -- is of course very wide and far reaching as we've seen the first estimates for the costs of the storm's damage.
On -- and -- are about what on next guess originally expected.
Jeff masses a director of -- urology for Weather Underground joining us now Jeff.
OK last Friday said this would likely be a billion of dollar -- Disaster.
My goodness it was so much more was -- net.
Yeah I was being conservative because I didn't know what mr.
-- is gonna hit relative to high tide.
If -- hit hit debt load tied to damage would have been far -- Yeah we're talking about twenty billion property damage is maybe ten billion -- thirty billion even Summers saying in lost business.
I mean what do you think now that you've seen the damage what do you think it could total.
Yes certainly -- a fifty billion between the two -- is probably a pretty good testament.
I'm a little surprised it isn't higher but we haven't seen what the -- business is going to be yet and certainly shutting down.
The nation's largest city and 10% of its GDP is going to be very costly.
Jeff area where the Weather Underground -- it's a no -- Boston insurance.
Officials this question but it appears of the weather patents.
All changing and these type of monster storms perhaps are becoming more likely would you agree with the Adam why.
I'd agree that in the last two years the US is seen an unprecedented sort of severe weather on slot.
I mean this year -- we -- you know of course sandy we had summertime in March last year we had record floods on the Mississippi the Missouri the -- -- -- And we had that tornado -- as well.
And I just say -- we've moved into a new climate regime.
It's not dissimilar climate I've known in thirty years as a meteorologist and I think have to point the finger towards heat trapping gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere here.
This is just a freak accident I mean this is two storms colliding that would normally never meet.
I mean it's it's it's a once in you know however many decades century accident that you -- -- happen.
-- freak events in the atmosphere happened naturally we saw -- back in 1903 that hit New Jersey that's the only American has ever done it.
So there is at large -- -- natural variability.
But just -- -- to need its purity of some of the disaster were seen in recent years are unlike anything we've ever seen in the US going back several centuries of record keeping.
Which makes me nervous us -- what you're expecting for this wind take away expect more of these big storms that obviously will turn into blizzards.
You know the only thing I'd be surprised at this winner parent or an ordinary winter.
We may have another winner like last you're basically did have a richer or not a severe one like the previous few winners -- -- got pounded his frequent snowstorms -- Normal is not normal anymore I just expect the abnormal.
-- That's says it all -- -- thank you so much for joining us today by Skype and cover hedging his bets -- -- that the upcoming winter it to be really wool mart can be really stalled -- is.

My god when it comes to caring for people.
-- -- new York New Jersey and Connecticut not just the United States but all over the world.
Can't there be some people who have compassion to know that.
These -- what god expects us to do that's why we say in god -- -- now -- no explanation.
The rug is pulled out.
From all of us but most of all our constituents.
This is a disaster you're on top of a disaster.
Hello and welcome to foxnews.com.
Alive and on the hunt.
Jonathan Hunt is not in today -- he will be back with us here's you next week.
I'm -- -- one of the correspondents here Fox News Channel so glad you're here with us and happy new year to -- Obviously opening up with those sound bite says Keyes is up in teases out.
For our first topic which is of course the hurricane sandy a relief efforts going underway and as you can tell there's not a lot of happy people.
About what's going on I want to introduce our guest here on set and we're gonna talk to us about the delay in the vote on super storm sandy aid.
That his angered so many both on the ground who are still victims.
And many of the GOP we've got Thomas facility of former executive director of the New York State Republican Party.
I got your name right you got excellent ING -- green former president of the women's media center and of course you know her as a Fox News contributor we see all the time and love to have you here on the panel.
Great to see you both happy new year to -- -- -- him.
Happy -- I you know it's not a happy new year for these folks still suffering I mean you know so much has happened since hurricane sandy.
Of course with those shootings in Connecticut and and all the rest that has happened.
But these people are still out there suffering -- there's this bill that has been delayed.
On the votes and a lot of people aren't happy northeast lawmakers are infuriated as we heard.
But you pointed out before we started this show that this bill that there's a delay on.
-- you can -- describe for people you know what some of the problems UC with the bill may be why.
There has been -- the delay in this because house speaker John Boehner.
On Wednesday set a January 15 vote on the super storms sandy relief bill.
After these in -- northeast politicians including.
A governor Chris Christie New Jersey a fellow Republican a blasted the speaker for skipping action on disaster -- in the final hours of the current congress so.
These people are waiting for help they need help they are expecting help they thought they were getting this help.
And now there's a delay on the vote of how this money is gonna comment but they really weren't gonna get -- Hope to begin with some -- and we all feel for the folks who who.
-- were affected by hurricane sandy.
But the fact of the matter is that the senate draft of the bill and it was it was spearheaded by Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand -- senate spearheaded the bill.
That was sixty billion dollars the vast majority of it had absolutely nothing to do.
With sandy aid and even though it was branded as an emergency bill less than 15%.
Of that need was actually going to be spends.
For seeing the victims -- when he thirteen.
This is a bad piece of legislation and so what that the speaker is doing now is they're going to split it out they're gonna have to separate votes.
They're gonna take the stuff the -- hundreds of millions of dollars for.
The Smithsonian and for Alaskan fisheries and for everything else under the sun they're gonna split that off from the aid package which is really what we should be focusing on.
-- I think it's -- -- -- to delay the vote I think that I think it's a bad piece of legislation what I really would have liked to have seen -- instead of all those folks getting up and blasting.
-- the speak you're blasting this person or that person is actually writing a clean.
Bill to help with disaster relief this was not a clean bill this is a special interest give away.
Where 80% of the money wasn't even gonna end up going says sandy relief victims we should have a clean bill that bill should be voted on in the house and sent back to the senate so that people can get -- relief.
Right away not a year from now two years from now or some.
Sometime down the road giving you agree with that how this needs to be divvied up well I agree with governor Chris -- -- is not often I think.
Remarks that he made at the press conference.
Following the delay of the vote need to be played to every household in America need to be -- every elected official.
They need to have a conference especially on the GOP side and sit down and figure out how to finally started to get government working again.
I will take.
The opinions of Governor Christie and Governor Cuomo over you know I'm sorry.
I go -- all due respect you know.
Speaker Boehner had made a promise.
To these states that this bill was going to be voted on.
All of -- you know shenanigans of what's in the bill and it's not a good bill I feel like those are talking points after the fact to try to protect.
The house GOP and the other -- That they are in they have.
Simply forgotten their number one duty.
Of actually being public servants and are putting politics -- For help me.
Whether you're Democrat or Republican and this is where Christie said it's so eloquently.
It when it comes to disasters we -- all Americans this is about red states and Blue States and -- became politicized.
It's not politicize the mean here.
The speaker promised to -- to help these folks and what the senate Democrats send him.
Was a bill that didn't help these people waiting when you're talking about us -- you're talking without your talking about -- with Governor Christie with Governor Cuomo.
Days in advance thinking this was the last minute this isn't so now governor cracking me Governor Cuomo -- Governor Christie governor of animal.
Money he tried to reconstruct -- hell Hillary -- we're going to put it up.
And then he realized -- I've already upset many of the most conservatives this is exciting -- which.
Again they've been holding our country Kostis and now they -- -- this is the reason why we have a spending problem.
It's because we have progressives who don't think that a sixty billion dollar bill.
Deserves some analysis some sort of consideration.
That this is a bill that -- was passed as an emergency measure.
Were only 15%.
Of the expenditure was actually going to be used for emergency purposes.
Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie hammered one -- effort money that is going to -- able to help their constituency.
And this building -- and -- that -- the the number of days it took to get aid.
Two the folks in Florida after hurricane Andrew the folks in New Orleans and Mississippi in the gulf this state.
States how only -- it -- and verses like the 66 days that we're still passed for this bill will hear this this was alarming and should be -- something that every single American pays attention to this week congress is broken.
And it's broken because John Maynard does not happen to have any ability to lead his troops and it's broken because of that far.
Right ideological conservatives who Qaeda in 2010.
And feel like if it's their duty to destroy government's -- originated in the democratic senate.
This bill originated in the democratic senate.
And it became a full of pork in this big special interest give away and I agree -- of them.
There's no reason why it took congress.
And not Republicans or Democrats for congress together and you -- were called you know.
The upper house is controlled by then they pass a bill they head into the -- to the day that passes the bill.
Sixty days after hurricane.
Sandy you Europe they are part of an innocent they're -- again that.
Our government is being held hostage whether it's by a small number of senators.
In the US senate we need filibuster reform hopefully we're gonna see some of that in this new congress hopefully.
John -- either I mean I think it's just rumors about what's gonna happen with him I think he will maintain -- the speakership.
But he needs to get a hold.
Of his members he needs to take control and put them in line because something passed again.
Government is broken I don't know if you're one of those Republicans who.
It celebrates because you want government to be broken you want nothing to be legislated on you want nothing to be effective.
I don't know there -- many of your colleagues who filled -- -- talking about effectiveness and again there are pieces of legislation.
That if it's an emergency bill that's -- provide emergency aid to people who need it now.
Then why are we sitting here talking a -- piece of legislation were only 15% of the money.
Goes to those people and only a small percentage of it is actually spent -- calendar year Peter King aren't very strong tough for public and on from New York who do you as executive director of the new York Republican Party.
No I don't yeah I wanted to mention.

Description
Like aging baby boomers, the cartoon strip Funky Winkerbean and its creator Tom Batiuk have turned gray with life's ups and downs in a 40-year run on the funny pages. (May 30)
Transcript
[Location - Date:Medina, Ohio 4/16/2012][Source:AP]SOUNDBITE: "In conjunction with Funky's 40th anniversary, the Kent State University press is going to be reprinting the entire run of Funky."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)Batiuk sketching "Funky Winkerbean" cartoonSOUNDBITE: "They're going to bring out a volume a year for the next 14 years. If I continue to do the strip and the strip continues running, they won't catch me. In fact, I hope they don't catch me actually."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)Photo: Batiuk drawing comic stripSOUNDBITE: "When Funky started out there was a bunch of teen strips that were getting a little long in tooth. They had sorta covered the territory of parent - teen conflict. Parents arguing with the kids about the car or the phone or telling them to go clean their room. I wanted funky to be anything but that - just to stay away from all that stuff. They dealt with 2% of the school football team and cheerleaders so I was left with everything else."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)Batiuk sketching "Funky Winkerbean" cartoonCU: Funky Winkerbean comic stripSOUNDBITE: "I kinda went inside to the inner conflict so I wrote about less waking up in the morning and feeling sick because you knew you had to go to the gym and climb the rope to the ceiling that day. Or you knew there was going to be somebody waiting after school to beat him up."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)CU: Funky Winkerbean comic stripSOUNDBITE: "I used to go out to my old high school to sketch, I still do. I just sketch and hang around and keep up with things. So if I draw a drinking fountain, it looks like a real drinking fountain. And one day I'm looking through my sketch book and there's this girl in high school who I'd sketched who was pregnant and I thought if i'm going to deal with reality, deal with things in the moment I should do this as well. so I wrote this story where a girl in high school was pregnant. And that girl was lisa. And les wasn't the father but he was her best friend and her birthing partner through this whole process. And once they'd gone through that it was going to be very difficult to have les hanging from the gym class rope during the middle of the homecoming dance."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)CU: Cover of Lisa's story: funky winkerbeanSOUNDBITE: "So the characters were telling me they were ready to move on, I was older. And it was just a good time for me to start using the experiences that I had since I got out of school, I was just out of school practically when I started funky. And now as i've grown, the strips could grow and the characters could grow up."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)CU: Sketches of characters from Funky WinkerbeanSOUNDBITE: "Les is trying to get a date in high school was rather simplistic stuff, just surface stuff. But once they grew up, les and his realtionship with lisa was much more nuance, much more complicated and I liked writing about those things. And the other thing that complicates life is that things change, that things happen to people. I'd reached a stage where i was starting to hear about friends, relatives where someone was dealing with breast cancer. And i took that stuff and internalized it to create an inner landscape that i could draw upon to write a story like that, so i did. Lisa became diagnosed with breast cancer."CU: Sketch where Lisa is diagnosed with breast cancerMS: Characters Lisa and Les from Funky WinkerbeanMS: Lisa's story the other shoe coverSOUNDBITE: "But i think it's important to deal with stuff like this, i think that art at it's core helps us to share the human experience. And sometimes it provides us with insights, sometimes it confirms our worst suspicions. But it's a shared experience. And comic strips are uniquely positioned to do that sort of thing because they are there every day in people's lives and their just sorta interwoven in the fabric of their lives. i think that helps you to share that work in a much more intimate way, especially in a strip where the characters are aging and growing older. Each strip then becomes like a breath, like a passing movement. I think that's nice if you get even close to that."(Tom Batiuk/Cartoonist)Batiuk signing his name on "funky Winkerbean" cartoon

The.” Bombs Aimed at G.I.’s in Iraq Are Increasing
... it took five years of protecting you for the Bush Administration to finally figure out to ban water..
posted by JimK at 10:40 AM
I heard on the news last night that 17,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since January 1, 2006. SEVENTEEN THOUSAND in less than 8 months.$250 billion and countless innocent lives WASTED thanks to the lies by the current administration. Go on Orin, tell us again about how outrageous it was for Clinton to tell a lie about his personal conduct but it was hunky dory for Dumbya to lie about Iraq.
??Wow, I thought you were pro-choice. I mean countless innocet lives wasted 45 million since Roe V Wade. unless you are just lieing about being Concerned about lost innocent life.
Did you know that 45 million is 6428 times grater than 7 thousand
Obviously, some of America is not a "tough crowd," and will believe anything they're told.Luckily this isn't very many people these days. It's just down to the very dumbest few, as exemplified by Anon here.PB
pb sharp wit. that was a good one. you need to take the act on the road.

BoB Blades
These are the bladed implements carried by seven men on this year's Annual Winter BoB Exercise. I know it's difficult to see - if you click on the pic it will enlarge.
I will attempt some cogent observations later but right now I need to go work on a wheel chair ramp for some poor widows...
...as Arnold said, "I'll be back!"
......................................
A blog reader sent in this comment with regards to the picture: Is that a kukri? They would be on par with a machete for clearing brush, but I wouldn't imagine carrying one in a survival situation for their size and shape.
I started to post a reply in the comments section and just decided to bring it out here for all to see more easily.
It is not a kukri it is a parang - a bit lighter but still heavy. It's a jungle knife fashioned from a leaf spring. I am probably going to replace it with my Mora 2000. It’s heavier than a machete so it is not as good with light vegetation as a machete but it is much better at hacking through tougher stuff. And that’s the rub – it is heavy.
But the thing is, I have been on events where all of the wood was covered in a layer or ice, or soaked with rain, and I had to baton my way into them to reach dry wood. Now - I can baton with a Mora2k - sort of. And there are other lighter knives that can baton well - my wife carries a BK&T Camp Knife that is as big as my parang but much lighter.
Also, I have a background in Filipino Martial Arts and I can FIGHT with that parang. The balance, the edges, the handle geometry... Now, granted, I can fight with a Swiss Army knife as well and let's face it - I won't be fighting with my knife in a Bug Out situation - I guess I could but come on....
Another thing the parang does which a lighter knife will not do nearly as well is hack. And there again, truth be known - on the 20 or so events I have carried the parang along on - I really haven't hacked all that much.
There was some kind of touchy feely move amongst the “save the earth” hippy crowd back in the 70’s to get away from big aggressive (say it with a lisp) knives and simply carry a Swiss Army Knife or some such. And truth be known – you can do the vast majority of your knife chores with a very little knife. I gutted and went through the ribs of a young doe with an original Gerber LST (about a 1.5 inch blade). And while “a big knife will do anything a small knife can but not vice versa” is generally true – it’s hard to clean a rabbit with a foot long blade.
If I “could only have one thing” in a survival situation it would be a knife like that parang or a Cold Steel Trailmaster bowie. But I am not limited, am I? I have a whole BoB full of goodies. What it is coming down to with me, gang, is weight. I am getting older and am not the 30 year old mountain running stud I used to be. And really - we could all probably make better use of the weight allowance (no matter how fit one is – one can only carry what one can carry and so choices must be made).
So yeah, I’m probably going to bid adieu to the heavy knife. The good news is, I’ll have it out so I can actually play with it more.
See ya out there.
And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's rasor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weight,

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for your support of this video and all of your messages and comments! I've posted some of my thoughts on the video and its success at on.fb.me/HzgMtY and facebook.com/chrispzero
Watch in HD with sound on!
Chicago is the first destination for my new series, Places in Time. This piece focuses specifically on downtown Chicago, which was my home for over 6 years until late 2010.
Downtown Chicago has long been an active area - a financial and transportation hub flanked by the lakefront, Grant Park, residential districts and shopping, but the area has evolved rapidly during the last decade and is now more than ever a major residential and tourism center. Between the world class skyline, lakefront, and park space, downtown Chicago offers scenery and an environment not found anywhere else in the non-coastal USA. The central city on an average day contains a blend of office workers, residents, commuters, and a mesh of locals, suburbanites, and tourists who venture in to enjoy the great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment.
When I first moved to downtown Chicago in 2003, I lived in one of the only residential buildings in the Chicago Loop. Most businesses shut down after the workday and the area was very quiet at night. Since that time, the number of residents, and all the restaurants, shopping, and entertainment that support them, has grown rapidly in the Loop, South Loop, and West Loop neighborhoods. Living in a rapidly gentrifying area can be frustrating at times, but the transformation of the area in such a short period was nothing short of amazing to witness.
Chicago as a whole has a great energy - one of America's few dense urban environments where people are forced to step out of their isolating cars and experience life alongside one another. The people are mostly genuine, hard working, and friendly. There are countless vibrant neighborhoods with a dramatic range of uniqueness and character. The city changes and transforms during each of the four seasons, but never ceases to be active and full of life.
All footage for this piece was shot between 2010 and now. My goal was to provide a glimpse into the energy and fast paced life of an average day in downtown Chicago, enhanced through fast motion timelapse. Some of the viewpoints and locations may seem familiar, but I've also tried to showcase the city from a number of different and less common vantage points.

The Places in Time series will be an ongoing series exploring different locations that I visit. I travel America and the world to create stock photography, timelapses, and other video. Most of my trips have very tight schedules that don't allow me the time to thoroughly explore, but I will be using this series as a reason to delve deeper into destinations and try to capture the real energy and atmosphere of the cities, areas, and countries that I visit.

We’ve received another email question from one of our readers, this one concerning a specific type of body language: eye contact. Eye contact can be a very useful tool for flirting with women, so that’s exactly what we’re going to talk about in this article. Here’s the question:
Eye contact is one of the most powerful expressions of interest you can give without even being near to a person. Women use it all the time to show they're open to an approach, so be on the lookout!
Dear Vin,
I keep coming across the same situation over and over again. There’s a woman in the room, she’s at a distance, and I’m trying to engage her in an interaction by showing her a bit of interest from across the room.
I’m wondering, in situations like these, how do you use your eye contact to flirt? How can I use eye contact to create a bit of a spark, so that going over to her won’t seem like such a big deal?
Adam, – Nebraska
If you want to create this spark you’re talking about and learn how to be a master flirt, you’re going to have to use the full spectrum of all your body language – not just eye contact. For that, it’s important to remember the following key points:
Tip #1 – Confident body language
Body language can portray a whole lot about a person, and we as humans are highly adept at detecting and decoding body language, even if we mostly do it on a subconscious level. If someone has droopy shoulders, is constantly frowning, and seems fidgety – women automatically think less of them.
The way you stand out is by portraying confidence, even if at first you need to act a little to pull it off. That means you stand tall and pay attention to your posture. Make sure you smile a lot, even if there’s no apparent reason for it – since a happy guy is an attractive guy. If you do this long enough, then sooner rather than later you’re actually going to become at ease with yourself, and then… well – then your body language will begin to reflect a natural and effortless confidence.
Tip #2 – Body orientation
A tell-tale sign of female interest is when her body and feet are facing in your direction, even if she’s looking away from you.
On the other hand, as a guy, you don’t want to be facing her with your body. If you do, you’re going to be giving her too much attention, and this will actually backfire and have the negative effect of being a turn off. You want your body not facing her – but rather facing someone who you’re having a conversation with.
Now, once you’ve implemented the above two body language tips, we can move on to the eye contact.
Tip #3 – The Eye Contact
Every once in a while, as you look over in her direction, try to find her eyes and pick one eye, whether it’s the left or the right, and hold onto that eye contact. Just keep holding onto that eye. Do not break off no matter what she does. Keep holding that eye contact for as long as possible until she breaks it off. Once she breaks it off – then you stop looking too.
(If you keep looking you’ll just come off as a freak.)
Now what this does is it demonstrates that:
- You’re a confident person.
- You’re interested in her.
- You’re an alpha male because you’re not breaking off eye contact, you’re maintaining it.
It’s important not to make that mistake of becoming too persistent and too needy by giving her too much attention. That’s why you want to just keep it light, keep it fun, and not be too serious about the whole thing.
What you’ll find if you consistently apply these three flirting tips, is that she’ll actually be laughing and smiling, and she may even signal you to come across and go and talk to her. She will actually open you up and you won’t have even needed to open your mouth.
Just remember to pay attention to your body language. You will be surprised by how powerful these three things in conjunction can do when meeting an attractive woman.
If you want more in-depth tips on how to make body language work for you, then I suggest you check out the Attraction Code, which also covers the other basics of dating that many guys aren’t very knowledgeable about.

Hot Seat
It was a tough Valentine's Day for Google. The No Love for Google website was urging users to "Break up with Google" in a widely disseminated video on the Internet. Meanwhile, another group of activists for Chinese democracy were marketing Goolag apparel to protest the company's tacit approval of authoritarian information policies.
Right now I am watching live streaming video of Congressional testimony about Internet restrictions in China with which American companies like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Cisco are cooperating. The philosophical issues are interesting and include the question of whether a "right to knowledge" is a human right. Practical concerns about how to regulate a globally distributed Internet that can't be easily commodified for purposes of trade policy certainly merit being on C-SPAN as well.

Facts & Statistics
Developing the Arts in Ireland, Arts Council Strategic Overview, 2011-2013
In keeping with Visual Artists Ireland’s strategy, and in support of the Arts Council of Ireland and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland’s strategies, we maintain a breath and balance of information and support of all visual art forms. Our membership is across the generations of visual artists.
Visual Artists Ireland has a strong ethos that our work is to the benefit of artists at all stages of career and development, and is not solely to the benefit of paid members of Visual Artists Ireland. In 2010 we updated our web presence so that we can provide information on the visual arts to the wider public through the upgrade of our website, and also the provision of information through social networking channels such as Facebook and Twitter, and VAI’s own social networking site, The Common Room.
We have also been active with the visual arts sector, government, local authorities, national and international representative bodies and the media to endeavour that the current understand of the status of professional visual artists reflects the reality of life; the uniqueness of visual artists’ needs; their roles in contemporary Ireland; the benefits of visual artists to the life of Irish society; as well as contributing to policies, strategies, and the development of partnerships.
Our work on behalf of the individual is also accompanied by our continued discussions with, and support services for organisations working in the visual arts, or who may have need to access our network. We work with visual arts service and resource providers, local authorities, development agencies, corporate bodies, and private individuals who require access to professional visual artists.
Since 2009 we have seen an increase in the number of members who have come from other countries to live in Ireland. Rather than isolating them into specific streams, our policy is one of complete inclusion in terms of the work that we undertake.
It is a very specific objective of Visual Artists Ireland to deliver the above in a concise and effective manner, that is both strategic and responsive to long term and immediate needs of the visual arts sector and specifically visual artists.

Are SBCs typically positioned behind a firewall or in front of it? I've done some googling on this subject and haven't found any references to best practices for network deployments of SBCs. I can think of arguments either way. In any case, doesn't it seem that the firewall and SBC appliances will merge? -Bob

Caldera Volcanoes.. The Mythological Beast of Volcanology
Image Wikimedia Commons : Aniakchak Caldera – Alaska
If you’ve ever paid attention to volcanoes, there is a good chance you’re familiar with what a caldera is. For those who are new to the terminology, a caldera is a collapse structure that forms when the magma chamber below a volcano empties, leaving the overlying rock to subside into the ground. Calderas are to volcanoes what an atom bomb is to explosives. They’re the largest, most destructive, and rarest variety around, and because of that, they’re incredibly interesting.
Caldera forming eruptions are interesting and notable to scientists and casual observers alike since they’re both rare, and incredibly powerful. In fact, some caldera-forming eruptions can be so powerful, that they’ve been associated with global climate change, and small-scale extinction events. Due to their potentially cataclysmic nature, there is a lot of misinformation and doom & gloom in the press and media.
Chances are, you’ve heard the title “supervolcano”. The term “supervolcano” was coined by the media to describe the largest caldera-forming eruptions on earth. Ever since the inception of the term, it’s been used to describe any massive volcanic eruption, the likes which haven’t been seen in the modern era. So what are some common myths about calderas and supervolcanoes? Read the guide below!
Debunking Myths Associated With Calderas
Myth – There Are Only 6-7 Supervolcanoes on Earth
Somewhere along the line, the media decided that there were less than 10 supervolcanoes on earth. This myth is a bit difficult to dispel, because there is no real cutoff between “supervolcano” and “really large caldera” as it’s not a true scientific term.
Campi Flegrei in Italy is frequently described as a supervolcano, yet it’s not even 1/10 the size of Lake Toba. If we were to assume that Campi Flegrei is a proper supervolcano, then that means there are over 100 known supervolcanoes on our planet, and it would be on the lower end of the size spectrum. If we’re defining “supervolcano” by capability of producing a VEI – 8 eruption, then it’s true that there are only a few volcanic systems with this capability.
Myth – All Calderas form from explosive eruptions
While more calderas form as a result of a violent eruption, some caldera systems form from a gradual subsistence. Hawaiian volcanoes have calderas that formed slowly following the gradual effusion of basaltic magma, which caused a gradual drop in the size of the magma chamber. Subsistence calderas form most often in mafic shield volcanoes, which are common in oceanic hotspots such as the Galapagos, or the Hawaiian Islands.
Myth – Volcanoes that have had a violent caldera forming eruption are extremely violent by nature
Caldera forming eruptions are more of a cyclical process then they are indicative of a Volcano’s overall nature. Even extremely violent and active volcanoes such as Krakatoa show that they’ll stay active with small-scale eruptions post-collapse. A caldera-forming event typically happens only after a volcanic system has been “plugged” up for a long enough time, allowing pressure to build and magma to evolve to a degree that it can erupt in a dramatic fashion. For some volcanoes, this takes a very long time, others like Krakatoa can recharge much quicker. Some caldera volcanoes will create multiple massive caldera-forming eruptions. Others will only go massive one time, then they’ll sprout several smaller volcanoes after the initial caldera collapse event.
It’s also important to note that there are different varieties of explosive calderas. Caldera volcanoes formed from andesitic arc-volcanism behave in a much different fashion than Caldera volcanoes that form from basaltic rift-oriented volcanism, which typically erupt effusive basalt eruptions, but can create massive rhyolitic eruptions on rare occasion. These caldera systems are usually indicative of a large heat source (basaltic magma) transforming country rock into Rhyolite (the most explosive variety of magma) which later erupts after being disturbed by a fresh injection of basaltic magma.
Myth – Supervolcanoes Are Formed By Hotspots
The largest caldera systems in the world all have a few things in common, yet being hot spot volcanoes is not a similar trait they share. In fact, Yellowstone is the only supervolcano that is known to be formed in association with a mantle plume (hot spot), whereas most other supervolcanoes are located in subduction arcs. What they do have in common is extremely hot and shallow heat sources, typically produced by continental rifting. Rifting occurs when land pulls apart due to largely tectonic reasons. Rifting lowers underlying pressure and thins the surface, which in turn pulls magma and hot rock closer to the surface. Eventually, these large shallow heat sources melt and evolve country rock (often granite) into our familiar friend Rhyolite. If you accumulate enough Rhyolite, let it evolve for a long enough time, then set it off with a fresh injection of magma, you have the ingredients for a massive eruption.
For Yellowstone, the heat source comes from the mantle plume, instead of a rift-oriented heat source (although it’s likely some rifting is occurring as well).
Google Earth Overlays For Caldera Systems – Calderas Outlined in Green or Red (screenshots)
Ecuador has quite a few massive caldera systems, with the Chacana caldera being the largest
Of the 11 large calderas in Kamchatka, the smallest is still 10 square KM..

LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Texas ought to win.
Maybe it’s the eyeball test or perception or history, but Texas has immense firepower and, frankly, when you look at the Longhorns, you see a group that oozes height and athleticism and, when hitting on all cylinders, as good a volleyball team as you could imagine.
But then there’s Oregon, which simply confounds you.
Oregon may not look like it should be the team to hoist the trophy Saturday night at the end of the NCAA Division I Women’s Volleyball Championship, but only a fool would count these Ducks out after what they’ve done the past three matches.
Texas (28-4) of the Big 12 was seeded third when this tournament was set up. The Longhorns beat Colgate, Texas A&M, Florida, and USC to get to this final four and then escaped Michigan in five on Thursday night, winning 15-11 in the fifth.
Texas hasn’t won the title since 1988 and had agonizing endings in the 2008 semifinal (losing to Stanford in five), in the 2009 title match (losing to Penn State in five), and in the 2010 semifinal (losing again to Penn State).
Oregon (30-4) of the Pac-12 was the fifth seed in the tournament, so it’s probably not fair to call the Ducks Cinderellas or anything like that. But, c’mon, Oregon didn’t make the tournament in 2010 and last year lost in the first round to Colorado State. The final four? Oregon has never been this far before and let’s face it, most people thought if anyone from the Pac-12 was going to be here, it would have been Stanford or UCLA or USC or Washington.
Yet in this tournament Oregon rolled past Northern Colorado and Dayton and then beat BYU before stunning Nebraska in Omaha last Saturday to make it here. And then Thursday the Ducks, down a set, stormed back and won the next three to send top-ranked and top-seeded Penn State back to State College.
Both teams have the respective players of the year from their conference. Texas outside hitter Haley Eckerman, a 6’3” sophomore from Waterloo, Iowa, was the Big Ten Player of the Year. Oregon boasts Alaina Bergsma, who gets everyone’s attention for having been Miss Oregon USA, but the 6’3” senior outside hitter from Chandler, Ariz., was named the Pac-12 Player of the Year.
But no one has anyone like Liz Brenner.
To wit: She started playing racquetball at age 5 and won a 6-and-under world championship, the first of 11 such titles. She’s a power forward on the Oregon women’s basketball team. Last year she was a backup catcher on the Oregon softball team that went to the world series. And this year she’s forsaking softball to compete in the javelin and shot put for the Ducks world-renowned track and field program.
“I absolutely love sports,” she said. “Love watching them, love playing them.”
Brenner stands 6’1” – “I’ve been this size since the sixth grade” -- is thick and muscular, moves with a grace that belies her build, and can flat out tattoo a volleyball. When Oregon beat Penn State, Brenner led with 17 kills, had 17 digs, and four block assists. Six of her kills came in that critical second set in which Oregon blew a 20-10 lead before winning 30-28 on Brenner’s big hit.
“I know I’m obviously not the typical volleyball player,” she said. “I’m not super tall or super skinny. But I just use what I have. I use the athleticism and I have the strength, which a lot of people haven’t seen and also I’m pretty tall for someone who plays all the way around, which people haven’t seen either. I think it surprises a lot of people that I can do what I can do.”
None of that is lost on Oregon coach Jim Moore, who signed Brenner as a volleyball player only. But then the last year the Oregon basketball team had some injuries and then the same thing happened in softball, and, well, Moore isn’t complaining.
“Everybody wants to know why she’s such a good serve receiver. It’s because she’s such a good athlete. She just has that hand-eye coordination that you can bring if you play a lot of sports,” Moore said.
“We have so many kids who do nothing but play volleyball right now and they look awkward doing everything because they’re just volleyball players. And that’s all they’ve ever done, where someone like Liz who plays multiple sports brings athleticism to our sport that we don’t have … She knows how to move in space better than most people.”
The lanky Bergsma, appreciates the energy her teammate brings to the team.
“She’s just such a competitor. She’s by far the purest athlete I’ve ever gotten to play with,” Bergsma said. “I mean, people might look at her and think she’s not the same kind of athlete you see a lot of in volleyball, like she doesn’t jump and touch 11 feet and those kinds of things, but I’ve never had a teammate like that. It’s amazing knowing that she’s going to do what has to be done when she needs to.”
Brenner, who had a 3.4 GPA this semester, and who, by the way, touches 10 feet, says volleyball is her favorite and “the sport I absolutely love.” This season she’s second on the team only to Bergsma with 436 kills and is hitting .297 and is by far the team leader in serve reception. She is second only to libero Haley Jacob in digs with 285.
Her team’s success this month isn’t a surprise to Brenner, who not only was twice the Oregon Prep Volleyball Player of the Year, but also the top basketball player.
“From the beginning of this season we knew we were going to be good,” Brenner said. “We knew with the group we have now that this was going to be an extremely important shot for us. All season we’ve been battling to get there and we’re not giving up. We’re going to keep fighting until we do it.”
After Saturday’s championship match, Brenner is taking a week off before joining the basketball team. That team is currently 0-8, and she’ll miss three more games before getting out there on December 31.
“My first game is against UConn,” Brenner said with a smile. Last year she played in 21 games and averaged 5.8 points and 5.8 rebounds. Saturday night’s game not withstanding, she can’t wait.
“I’ve been playing so many sports my whole life, like when I have my week off next week I’m going to be bored out of my mind,” she said with another smile. “Because I’ll have nothing to do.”

The lights are slowly starting to come back on across Fairfield County after Superstorm Sandy and for most, things are slowly but surely starting to return to normal. However, there are still many in our region affected by this fierce storm in need of immediate help. We spoke with a number of groups here in Fairfield County working to help ease the burden and offer some ideas below for ways you can get involved.
In Stamford, The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County, which supports a number of local agencies including the Salvation Army, needs help refilling its pantry and supporting the countless people in the area affected by Sandy. Food Bank Executive Director Kate Lombardo tells us they are in serious need of non-perishable foods like breakfast cereal and Parmalat. You can get a full list of items they need on their website.
Lombardo also says they are looking for groups like local businesses to run food drives. She says the Food Bank will even come pick up the donations for a sizable food drive. If you’d like to volunteer, Lombardo says they are always looking for help sorting and stocking donations at their warehouse. To contact them, call 203.348.8898.
In neighboring Greenwich, Manager of Volunteer Resources and Youth Services at the American Red Cross-Metro NY North Chapter, Andrew Sindell, tells us that due to the overwhelming response to Sandy they are currently not deploying volunteers who are not already trained by the Red Cross. However, he says if you are interested in volunteering to contact them in one to two weeks when the immediate need settles down. There will still be plenty of work to do. Sindell also says individuals in Connecticut looking to get involved can call 211 to find out more.
In Darien, Person-to-Person says they are also seeing a huge need for food right now, especially for clients in Stamford and Norwalk who lost the contents of their refrigerators. P2P also lost power at its own food pantry and had to discard a significant amount of food, mostly meats. They are also in need of clothing donations and have already sent about 150 bags to Norwalk to help residents who have been flooded out of their homes. To help P2P, visit their website or give them a call at 203.655.0048.
In Fairfield, Director of Operation Hope Carla Miklos says their immediate need is for donations of non-perishable food items. They are also looking for donations of gift cards to local grocery stores like Stop and Shop or Shop Rite so clients can restock after losing food this past week. You can reach them at 202.292.5588.
Also in Fairfield, one of the hardest hit shoreline communities, there is an all-volunteer group coming together to mobilize a massive cleanup of the beachfront neighborhoods. Lindsey Morton and a couple of friends came up with the idea to launch Fairfield Beach Relief.
“We all grew up here in Fairfield and after Sandy we were looking to do something to help the victims living near the beach,” said Morton. “It seemed that everyone wanted to help those affected, but were having trouble finding a way to do so. We decided to name the date, time and place and the response was immediate.”
This Sunday November 11, volunteers will be meeting at Sherman School at 9:30 a.m. Groups will be dispatched to clean up affected homes and areas.
“Our hope was that this week, after power is restored, residents would be able to focus on the interior of their homes, especially with another storm in our future and the below-normal temperatures,” said Morton. “This way, we figure volunteers could arrive on Sunday to take care of the outside clean up that needed to be done.”
Volunteers are asked to bring rakes, work gloves, leaf bags, wheelbarrows and other equipment that may help also with the cleanup. Organizers ask that volunteers interested should RSVP via Facebook so they can be prepared with team assignments.
Katie Boland, a Fairfield native and one of the cleanup organizers, says this is all about a community sticking together through thick and thin.
“I grew up in Fairfield and spent many summers at Penfield and Jennings Beach. There's something really special about this community in Fairfield and I am excited to be able to give something back to it.”
At VolunteerSquare, this is just what we love to see happening! Let us know if there’s a community cleanup in your neighborhood so we can share it with our friends.
As you can see, there is no shortage of ways to help out. Even if not with one of these agencies, check in on your neighborhood or at your local school, community center or place of worship. Many are organizing smaller food drives and cleanups. As always, remember to check out Fairfield County-based VolunteerSquare.com to see volunteer opportunities throughout the year. It’s free and easy!

I just got this card in the mail for a gallery shindig tonight at the Art Institute of Austin. It features works from some of my very close friends and a few of my own pieces. We printed our stuff big. I’m talking four feet wide big. It looks neato. So if you happen to be wandering the streets nearby you should come in. I hear they have free food at these things.

ENERGY SECURITY
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, in these opening weeks of the 110th Congress, the Democratic majority in the House has succeeded in passing a package of bills that is designed to secure America. We passed a bill to improve our Nation's ability to prevent another 9/11 style attack on our country. We have made life a little more secure for millions in the United States who toil at the minimum wage, and millions of young people who leave college with a degree and a mountain of debt. We have secured the ability of America's medical researchers to explore and exploit the life-saving potential of stem cells. We have committed this government to safeguarding our economic security by ending years of fiscal irresponsibility. And today, we have begun what may be the most important project of all, to ensure America's energy security by ending our dependence on foreign oil and developing clean, green renewable sources of energy.
Ensuring our energy security will require more than just the protection of American oil supplies from terrorists in hostile nations. It will also mean we find homegrown fuel sources that reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
It will mean that we pare down our energy consumption and promote efficiency. It will mean that we transition to renewable energy sources that ensure a clean, dependable energy supply for years to come.
There are those who say that it would cost too much to shift our infrastructure over to new energy sources. They say that the market has decided that coal and oil are the cheapest energy, and that switching to renewable energy would harm our economy.
This is shortsighted, false, and, ultimately, dangerous because much of the true cost of oil and coal don't appear on the gas pump or on our electric bills. Extracting coal and oil harms the environment and burning fossil fuels produces pollution that clogs our cities and greenhouse gases that warm our atmosphere. Tens of thousands of Americans get lung cancer and other respiratory diseases from power plant air pollution and this, too, is part of the true cost of ``cheap' energy. These expenses are paid by the American people just as surely as they pay their electric bills.
But to find the true cost of a barrel of oil, we must look further, to a foreign policy beholden to oil and gas, and that price is too steep.
Today the House passed a bill that will roll back tax breaks for oil and gas companies and reform the royalty relief system that has cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. The $13 billion dollars saved by this overdue reform will be placed in a strategic reserve to be spent on programs to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and alternative fuels, promote energy efficiency, and step up research on advanced energy technologies. Initiatives like these are the only way to permanently reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and this bill is a good first step on the road to true energy security.
European and Asian competitors are already developing technologies that will reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions of greenhouse gases. Rather than American entrepreneurs, it is our competitors who are prospering from these developments. By marshaling America's great strengths, our inventiveness, our technological prowess, and our entrepreneurial spirit, we can better secure our Nation, save our environment, and become the world leader in this cutting-edge industry.
We must encourage the development of flexible-fuel and hybrid vehicles. These vehicles can be built with today's technology and will enable a smooth transition from gasoline to biofuels.
We must raise the corporate average fuel economy standards.
We must invest in research and development of new energy technologies, like wind power, cheap solar cells, plug-in hybrid cars, and cellulosic ethanol. The new energy economy will be dominated by rapid innovation, and the scientific investment we make now will be paid back with interest by the technologies it creates.
We must encourage employers to offer mass-transit benefits so that employees can commute without their cars, and support mass transit systems around the country.
We must pass global warming legislation to reduce our output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Many of America's most successful companies have realized that something must be done to contain global warming and they are now pushing Congress to lead.
We know what must be done to end our dangerous addiction to oil. All we need now is the will to do it.
Madam Speaker, we have lost so much time since 9/11, time that could have been so profitably used to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But it is not too late to abruptly and constructively change course. The American people are ready for a clean energy economy, and the bill we passed today will begin to put our country on that new road to energy independence and a more secure future.

North Dakota voters will choose their governor and lieutenant governor in the November election. This year's race features Republican Governor John Hoeven running again for a third term, with Democratic candidate Tim Mathern and Independent candidate DuWayne Hendrickson challenging the incumbent.
Democratic-NPL
Tim Mathern has served on the state senate for the last 22 years. He became the first person in his family to graduate from college after receiving his degree from North Dakota State University.
Mathern went on to earn a masters degree in social work from the University of Nebraska, and later earned a masters degree in public administration from Harvard University at the age of 50.
For 27 years, he worked at Catholic Family Service/Catholic Charities, and is currently working at Prairie St. John's Hospital in Fargo.
Health care
Mathern said that he has worked throughout his time as a senator to address health care issues in the state.
He put together a bill in the 1990s that attempted to provide more resources for pregnant women and new mothers in order to ensure they would have the proper resources to help them. He said that he wanted to help resolve as much as possible some of the main reasons why women chose to get abortions.
The bill addressed health care for pregnant women, proper care for children, daycare services, family life education services as well as child support issues. It was passed, something he said was a proud moment in his career since the subject of abortion tend to be divisive and controversial.
"When I look back, I would say that's probably pretty close to the top of the list - creating a bill where people on both sides of an issue and both parties work together to actually do something positive," he said.
Student issues
According to Mathern, he has been addressing student issues during his senate career as well. He said that sticking to his principles has meant that he supports policies that help everyone obtain a quality education.
"I pretty much vote quickly on all of the issues," he said. "I say if you've got your basic values down, really it isn't that difficult."
One of his plans if elected is to create a tuition repayment program for students that start or business or work in North Dakota after their graduation from a state school. Under his plan, one-eighth of a graduate's tuition cost total would be given back to them as an income tax credit every year for up to eight years.
He said this plan would use the income tax system rather than developing new government bureaucracy. Mathern added that it's important for the state to be innovative in providing incentives for students to live in the state after their graduation.
He estimated that the plan would cost $11 million for the first year and the funding would come from the general fund. Even though this is a large amount of money, Mathern said that the indirect benefit of keeping the students here would far outweigh the costs.
"It has great potential to basically say to our young people, here is a reason to stay," he said. "We give our young people so many reasons to leave."
According to Mathern, North Dakota has become a low-wage state that may attract some companies but end up underpaying workers. He said that efforts by Governor John Hoeven to get new companies to the state are sending the wrong message to college students that would like to remain in the area after graduation.
"I don't think we should give millions and millions of dollars to create jobs that are low-paying," he said. "I just think that's counterproductive."
He also supports proposals for a two-year tuition freeze and increases in grants to students.
"As far as I'm concerned, this is all an investment and this is all good news for North Dakota," he said.
Election goals
Mathern said that he would remain focused on health care as a top priority if elected. His plans call for providing coverage for the 15,000 uninsured people between the ages of 1 and 21 by extending an existing program called Healthy Steps.
Under current arrangements, the federal government reimburses North Dakota $.74 to the dollar for money it spends on insuring its young people. Mathern said the current eligibility cap of 150 percent of poverty level should be removed in order to open up access to the benefits.
"This is not a costly program ... it's taking what's already available to us and extending it to everybody, not just some folks," he said.
He said that he would also work to promote wellness and prevention efforts that can reduce future health issues and therefore lower health care costs by up to $2 billion in North Dakota.
Upgrading rural hospital infrastructure and creating an income-based health insurance plan for adults are also top health care priorities, he said.
Lifelong Rolette, N.D. resident Merle Boucher is Mathern's running mate, and has been leader of the House Democratic caucus since 1996. Boucher taught at Rolette High School for 20 years and is also a farmer.
He attended NDSU-Bottineau and Mayville State University, and earned a bachelor's degree in secondary education.
The other two candidates, John Hoeven and DuWayne Hendrickson will be featured in Tuesday's edition.

Ms. CHU. I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2681 and H.R. 2250.
Some in Congress want to use the jobs crisis as an excuse to roll back clean air protections that will prevent 9,000 premature deaths every year. Today, we are debating an unnecessary, wasteful bill that only delays long overdue pollution-reducing regulations at the expense of Americans' health. This is one of the Republicans' so-called ``jobs bills,'' conducting redundant and costly studies that will do nothing but add paper to landfills instead of creating jobs by upgrading cement kilns so that they are no longer a threat to public health.
These studies have been done. Americans are still breathing mercury, arsenic, and lead; but we have a means to clean it up. It's called the Clean Air Act, and it was passed in 1963. It is known as one of the most successful pieces of legislation in congressional history; yet the Republican majority is trying to gut it over and over, bill after bill, wasting time and energy that could be spent passing legislation that would help create new jobs for Americans. Today's bill would cancel requirements to clean up toxic air pollution, smog, and soot from cement plants.
So, while big companies save a penny or two, American families will face billions of dollars in increased health costs. Thousands more people will go to hospitals with cases of bronchitis, heart attacks, asthma attacks, and thousands more will die prematurely. These pollutants are also neurotoxins, causing major harm to the development of unborn babies, infants, and children.
While the majority claims that eliminating this antipollution rule for the cement industry will be good for business and the economy, the EPA rule institutes new standards based on the best available technology already in use in the industry. Let me repeat that. This rule that the Republicans are trying to weaken is based on the best available technology already in use voluntarily by a good portion of the companies in the industry.
What does that mean? These antipollution standards are actually achievable today, and companies are already using them and making a profit.
So today's bill is just another in a long string of anti-environment/anti-health attacks that look out for corporate interests over the best interests of American families. We cannot afford to give polluters a free pass to spew deadly, toxic air pollution that hurts our health and puts our children at risk. No matter what anyone says, increased pollution is not a sustainable path to job creation. Instead, we should be saving lives, saving our environment, and investing in the clean-tech jobs of the future.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and the anti-environment/anti-American health bill that is up for a vote tomorrow.
I yield back the balance of my time.

The hearing will come to order. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for another in our series of hearings on tax extenders.
During our Member Day hearing in April we had the opportunity to hear from our House colleagues about the merits of extending--or not extending--many of these tax policies. By all accounts it was a productive exercise. I commend Chairman Camp for providing the opportunity. His leadership in setting forth a transparent process for reviewing tax extenders is what the American people expect of their representatives. The days of simply rubber-stamping the extenders package are behind us.
Today we pivot to exploring ideas on the framework that Congress should use to evaluate tax extenders. Our witnesses will share their views on the principles of good tax policy, and the specific metrics against which Congress should test the merits of particular provisions. I look forward to the conversation.
Before we begin I would like to take a moment to thank Congressman Thompson for serving as Ranking Member for this hearing. Unfortunately, Congressman Neal couldn't be with us today because he's attending a funeral in Springfield for a fallen police officer.
I now yield to Mr. Thompson for his opening statement.

Writer Smash
My greatest difficulty as a writer?
Perhaps the whole fickle publishing industry, using authors as content machines and paying nothing to live on.
Or the changing author-agent-publisher relationship, backlash and bitterness, a traditional route and a new route and neither of the routes seemingly open to anyone.
Maybe Amazon offering an elitist “library” for those who have the money, keeping titles from every other platform, giving such an easy option writers fall for it even if it hurts them in the long run.
No, my greatest difficulty isn’t any of these things. It’s all of these things. Add to this the daily HOW TO WRITE, YOU MUST READ THIS TO WRITE, and 10 THINGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU WRITE AGAINST YOUR PUNY WILL articles tweeted from midnight to midnight. Authors I know losing faith in their work, in their process, thinking they need someone else’s process, lamenting the new process, becoming utterly processed and never writing a word. Arguments about self-publication, free books, the debate about the value of books. “Libraries are irrelevant in the new world order.” Whose new world order? And on. And on. And—
Not one of these things has the power to stop me from writing. But together they all do. The overwhelming writer-related negativity daily beaming into my brain from every corner of the world is enough to make me a little angry, and it’s hard to write while angry. Anger is not productive.
This is my greatest difficulty as a writer: staying calm and remembering that all these things are not writing. Only writing is writing.
To overcome this obstacle I’ve recognized that my access to this difficulty comes most often from the internet. This is how I read news, blog posts, twitter, and so forth. I regulate this access so I’m not bombarded with negativity before I get a chance to write each day. When the negativity arrives, breaking through my carefully laid plans, I see it for what it is and keep it separate from my work. Just because I’m writing a short story doesn’t mean the Kindle Select program will snap it up without my consent. Just because I’m writing a book doesn’t mean I must argue about whether I will eventually submit it to agents or editors or publishers or… Kindle Select. While I’m writing, the most important thing is the story. I breathe, I step back from the world, and make myself small and quiet—including any worries or judgements I have about the publishing world—so the story can speak up.
Basically I’m the writing equivalent of Bruce Banner. Most of the time I’m brilliant and productive, but I don’t like me when I’m angry.
I just… have to breathe.
And write.
Jen,
Bingo!
But, there you are, here I am. We could be doing the dishes or taking a walk. Or, posting and commenting.
Excuse me, I have to write another chapter in my novel. (Right after I check my google analytics.)
I see Social Media Anonymous emerging.
I’ll do a Facebook page!
Argh!
Only writing is writing!
And isn’t it wonderful when we remember that and get down to it.
Wise words–and an epiphany I found comfort in and wrote about awhile back, too. (In a totally different manner and rant, lol.
)
In my most obstinate days (which I try to cultivate, heh heh), I remind myself there have always been naysayers and doubting Thomases, have always prophets of doom and gloom predicting the death of publishing, the end of education, the demise of readers (and those who even can read), etc., etc., etc. …
Whatever. I’ll be at my computer. Or scribbling in a notebook. And loving it, because while I’m actually writing, not thinking about writing, all the negativity and fear floods away and I’m somewhere else entirely.
Thanks for the great post and reminder. Only writing is writing–and thank goodness for that.
You’re right–There have always been all those things… and always writers, too. Hooray!
Great post, Jen! I completely agree.
Thanks Ang
Your article made me smile.
I’m glad!

Michael Pollan, “Unhappy Meals”
Now this is what food should look like!
Pollença food market, Pollença, Mallorca.
(via withenoughbutter)
“Unhappy Meals,” an article by Michael Pollan published in the New York Times in 2007, chronicles the transition of America’s idea of health from eating healthy food to eating nutrients. His motto? “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” Sounds simple enough, but when you start to think about the different kinds of edible substances, not necessarily food, that one can get in the supermarket, this motto becomes more and more difficult to uphold. An average American grocery store is chock full of “low” and “free” foods (i.e. low-fat, or sugar-free), with labels making seemingly outlandish health claims. In fact, the majority of supermarkets have only a small section of the store dedicated to fresh fruits and vegetables, which often is just the perimeter of the store, and the countless center aisles are devoted to processed snack foods and quick frozen meals.
The old saying “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,” is extremely applicable here. While Brillat-Savarin may have meant that literally, I believe it can be applied in a broader sense to apply not only to a single person, but to American culture as a whole. Self control isn’t exactly one of American culture’s strong suits, and we are often associated with excess and obesity. So why is it that the aisles in the grocery store are filled with “health” foods, but we keep getting bigger? It all comes back to self control. We can’t call it quits after one cookie, so we buy low-fat, sugar-free cardboard cookies that leave our mouths dry and sweet teeth (?) unsatisfied after we binge-eat half the package. And the sad thing is, the people who eat like this often honestly believe they are being “healthy” because it’s low-fat! Of course, I’m using “we” in an extremely collective sense; I’m very much aware that not everyone embodies these eating habits, but sadly many do.
According to Michael Pollan,  I find mind-boggling, is that the nutrition of fresh fruits and vegetables is so often overlooked, and instead the attention is directed to the pre-packaged, freeze-dried snacks in the center aisles. Maybe it’s because we live in a time that medicine is seen as the first resort, not the last. When you have a headache, you don’t have a few glasses of water and see how you feel, you take an Advil. When you have a sore throat, you don’t gargle with salt water and wait a day, you immediately go to the doctor and insist on an antibiotic. When it comes to our diets, we can’t dilly-dally with meager vegetables! We need results! Food is subsequently being treated as a medicine, with added fiber and higher levels of vitamins, and the unaltered from-the-earth fruits and vegetables are left in the dust.
When I was young, I used to love to go to the Science Center. We would usually go on rainy days in the Summer when my mom was probably ready to kill my brother and me if we ran around the house, or asked to watch T.V., one more time. Like most museums, the exit was always through the gift shop. This place was awesome. Practically overflowing with everything from bouncy balls to k’nex roller coasters (remember k’nex?) and any other weird science-y thing you could imagine. I have a very vivid memory of picking up a package of “Astronaut Food,” and asking the cashier what it was; there was no way that rectangular block of foam was actually food… was it? She explained that when in space, astronauts had to eat freeze-dried meals, which gave them the same nutrients they would get when eating on earth. Is that what our future looks like? Just getting the nutrients we think we need, but in bland, freeze-dried form? I certainly hope not. Follow Pollan’s guidelines for eating, to steer us away from a future of astronaut food:
1. Don’t eat anything your great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.
2. Avoid those food products that come bearing health claims.
3. Especially avoid food products containing ingredients that are a) unfamiliar, b) unpronounceable, c) more than five in number— or that contain high-fructose corn syrup.
4. Get out of the supermarket and shop at farmers markets instead.
5. Pay more (for quality foods), eat less.
6. Eat mostly plants, especially leaves.
7. Eat more like the French. Or the Japanese. Or the Italians. Or the Greeks. In other words, have a relationship with your food; don’t just treat it as fuel for the machine.
8. Cook. And if you can, plant a garden.
9. Eat like an omnivore.

Market Recap

Hot Feature: Wealth Disparity Grows Between Lawmakers and their Constituents
Today’s markets were mixed because:
1) Home prices. Though equities closed the day mostly flat, they started the day sharply lower on news that U.S. home prices fell more than forecast in the year ended in October, indicating that the housing market continues to be weighed down by foreclosures. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 major U.S. cities fell 3.4 percent from October 2010 to October 2011, after decreasing 3.5 percent in the 12-months ended in September, the group said today.
2) Consumer confidence. Stocks quickly reversed their decline when the Conference Board announced its index of consumer sentiment rose to the highest level in eight months in December, with a reading well above the average during the recession that ended in June 2009. Improving sentiment might help sustain household purchases, which account for roughly 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The Conference Board’s measure of present conditions increased this month as well, as did its measure of expectations for the next six months, while the share of consumers saying they believed jobs were plentiful rose in December to its highest since January 2009 and those saying employment was hard to get decreased to the lowest since January 2009. More respondents also said they expected more jobs to become available in the next six months, and that they expect their incomes will likely increase as well.
3) Sears. Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) on Tuesday reported a sharp drop in holiday sales compared to a year ago, and said the results will force them to close 100 to 120 Sears and Kmart stores. As a result, SHLD shares plunged 26 percent, dragging down other retail stocks on fear that Sears might not be alone when it comes to underwhelming holiday sales figures. J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS), Saks (NYSE:SKS), The Bon-Ton Stores (NASDAQ:BONT), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) all closed the day lower.

An alleged con man accessed Waltham High School in May and stole an SAT test booklet from a safe, Waltham Public Schools Superintendent Susan Nicholson revealed this week.
"We don't know why they would do it," Nicholson said, calling it a breach of school security.
Nicholson made the announcement during a Sept. 12 citywide PTO meeting at Kennedy Middle School. New test booklets were quickly brought in and the test went was administered as scheduled for June 2.
The man entered the school at around 2:30 p.m. (after the sign in desk is torn day for the day) as students were being released and went to the guidance office, Nicholson said. The man identified himself as an employee of ETS, the company that administers the SAT tests, Nicholson said. The man said he needed to check on something with a group of test booklets, which are kept in a safe, she said. The staffer and the man went to the safe where she photocopied his license and allowed him to see the booklets, Nicholson said.
"When pressed for additional identification, he said, 'I'm all set'," Nicholson said. "No one noticed that he was able to hide [the test booklet] on his person. He did leave the guidance office, as far as we could tell, with one copy of the test booklet."
Nicholson said the incident was later reported to the Waltham Police Department, which investigated it. Investigators later determined the man's licenses and phone number were fake, she said. While investigators were unable to determine the man's identity, Nicholson said ETS showed school officials a composite photo of the alleged thief they believe took the booklet. Nicholson said investigators believe the same man is responsible for a similar incident in Newton three years ago.
The man was also spotted in Waltham High School on the evening of May 30, the night before the theft, Nicholson said. Investigators believe he was casing the school's security, she said.
As a result of the theft, Nicholson said school officials are taking steps to tighten test and school building security. Staff in the building at night will be "more vigilant" about building visitors and have janitors ask unrecognized visitors for identification and check with the office on the reason for the visit, Nicholson said.
ANNOUNCING THE THEFT
School officials gave differing answers when asked why the incident was not announced until now. When asked if the matter was previously disclosed, Nicholson said she had reported it to police and the school committee and said that was public record and said she did not know whether a public notice was ever distributed about the theft.
"I don't think that there was any intention to not say anything," Nicholson said. "We followed all the protocols including a police investigation."
No school committee member ever mentioned it at a school committee meeting, according to a review of the meeting minutes since May. A search of the web for media reports on the theft turned up no information. Also, Nicholson told meeting attendees of the incident in words that indicated she had never announced it before.
Mayor Jeanette McCarthy told Waltham Patch she learned of the incident after a constituent asked her about it. McCarthy said she later called Nicholson about it.

Across Pa., Abandoned Wells Litter The Land
The state estimates that about 325,000 wells have been drilled since the mid-1800s, but the locations of 200,000 of them are unknown. This proves problematic when new wells occasionally intersect abandoned ones, and gas rockets up to the surface in a geyser.

Last night saw heavy snow fall across most of the South of England. I know some people will say that four inches of snow is not that much, but for us here in Sussex it is quite unusual to see that much snow in one day.
What has been most surprising is that although it has continued snowing all day, the main roads in our area are quite clear (the photo above is a country lane nearby). That will all change tonight when the temperature drops below zero and everything turns to ice.

(Great dancing/trite story)
@T_Basic:Love of great dancing is enough to make you see this movie, even tough you have to sit through the trite story.
From the opening dance number on the streets of Miami to the closing flash dance at a container port, the Step Up cast is truly a revolutionary dance ensemble.
You'll have to sit through a story you've seen one too many times about the poor little rich girl (Kathryn McCormick) who wants to be a dancer over daddy's objections. She meets the poor guy from the wrong side of the tracks (Ryan Guzman), joins The Mob, a group of local street dancers, falls in love and tries to convince Daddy (Peter Gallagher) to cancel his plans to tear down the neighborhood and build his hotel.
The dancing is over the top, ranging from perfectly choreographed group numbers to individual and duet sets.
Posters in the lobby warn you that there is one dance routine that may be too disturbing after the recent shootings in Colorado. It involves attack weapons and gas masks in a dance routine.
It all comes down to the developer's decision to destroy the neighborhood for the sake of "progress,” leading up to a corny ending.
There is also the questions of where these economically deprived young people get the money for their elaborate costumes, props and electronic equipment and how they put together these elaborate dance routines overnight. But hey, this is the movies, and the positive escapism makes for feel good moments and spectacular dancing, so just go with the flow.
Rated PG-13, with some violence and some pretty sensual dancing.

IMBALANCE OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER: Rhode Island is one of the few states in the union where one branch of government is so clearly more powerful than the other two. Of course in our little bastion of political patronage, the most powerful branch by a long shot is the legislative branch. The Speaker of the House exerts far more power than the governor or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Senate President's power trails that of the Speaker only marginally. This has been accomplished over the years in part by the Speaker and the Senate President ensuring that judgeships are filled largely by their political friends – judges who will seldom rule against them in matters that might diminish their power over the executive branch. In essence, the legislative branch has "bought" the judicial branch in order to maintain its preeminent position in the government triumvirate.
This "imbalance of power" is being strengthened every year by the appointment of magistrates – "junior judges" who will likely be elevated to full judges at some point. Last week the Speaker's legal counsel and a former state senator were nominated for magistrate positions. This apparent circumvention of the 1994 law that intended to ensure judges are selected based on merit instead of political patronage has resulted in the number of magistrates exploding from only two in the early '90s to 21 today.
The "separation of powers" amendment to the R.I. Constitution attempted to remedy this imbalance of power among the three branches. It has met with only limited success, partly because it is hard to change old habits in the General Assembly. After all, it isn't easy to give up power. The appointment of magistrates by the legislative branch after they have been nominated by the judicial branch that is itself filled with legislative appointees, deprives the executive branch of its constitutional power to nominate judges. So much for separation of powers in R.I.
CONTRASTING EDC LOANS: One is amazed at the contrast between two EDC loans that have recently made the news. One, of course, is the ill-advised $75 million loan to 38 Studios – the company that promised us 450 jobs but is now in default and has released all of its employees. Contrast that whole saga with the courting of an energy technology company, Utilidata, by General Treasurer Gina Raimondo. Utilidata was brought to R.I. with only a $500,000 EDC loan. Not only is it successful thus far, it has already added 12 positions to our workforce and plans to add 35 more jobs with average salaries of $91,000 per year.
So, let's do the math. Seventy-five million dollars to 38 Studios for a promised 450 jobs that have now evaporated; that's $166,000 of taxpayer investment per job. Five hundred thousand dollars to Utilidata for a promised 47 jobs; that's $10,600 per job. Wow! What a difference! The $75 million lent to 38 Studios could have gone to 150 companies at $500,000 each and, if the Utilidata formula successfully prevailed, would have resulted in over 7,000 new jobs for R.I.
It just goes to show that Governor Chafee and other opponents of the huge loan guarantee to 38 Studios were right. And it shows that Gina Raimondo, a former venture capitalist, is far more capable of recognizing a company's potential for success than the collective guesswork exercised at the EDC. She should chair the EDC instead of the governor.
FISCAL COINCIDENCE: It is pure coincidence, but it is a striking one. 38 Studios declares bankruptcy, leaving Rhode Islanders to pick up the loan guarantee tab of $102 million. Coincidentally, the projected state surplus for the current fiscal year amounts to $102.7 million. So the huge ill-conceived taxpayer investment that has resulted in what appears to be a total loss wipes out the state's surplus. Just when we thought the surplus might be a harbinger of a fiscally stable future, the result of a bad loan comes along to shatter our hopes. It looks like Rhode Island just has bad juju!
VALEDICTORIANS' CAREER GOALS: Forty-six area high school valedictorians featured in last Sunday's Providence Journal indicated their career goals. The distribution of aspirations among these smartest of the smart is indicative of where our country is headed. Twenty of the 46 plan to pursue careers in medicine. This clearly follows the "graying of America" as the medical needs of an older population become greater and, unfortunately, the costs become higher. Of concern, only seven want to enter the field of business; not a good sign for an economy already losing ground on the world stage. Worse, only four want to become engineers. This is ameliorated somewhat by the seven who will pursue scientific research, but the relatively small combination points to an insufficient emphasis on science and technology in our high schools. The most refreshing revelation? Only three of the 46 want to become lawyers. In a country whose problems are greatly exacerbated by the ever-increasing number of avaricious attorneys who actively promote costly litigation, this disinterest in joining a group so infested with bottom-feeders is encouraging.
OLD GUN BECOMES YOUNG GUN: The national Republican Party has elevated Rhode Island Republican congressional candidate Brendon Doherty, former State Police superintendent, from one of 112 "on the radar" candidates to one of 21 "young guns," a designation that will likely mean much more support – both financial and organizational. More important, it indicates the national party believes that current Congressman David Cicilline will be one of the sitting Democratic congressmen most easily defeated in November. Cicilline's weakness stems, of course, from his involvement in Providence's financial mess and his dishonesty with voters about the city's financial health as he was leaving the mayor's position and vying for his congressional seat. It must make Doherty, the not-so-young guy who carried a gun for the State Police for so long, feel great to now be designated a "young gun." And it must make Cicilline, the culprit running away from his record in Providence, worry doubly now that more figurative guns are out to capture him.

For example, she said Royal Caribbean now "charges for food in the dining room that used to come with your cruise. Surf and turf is $38 but surf and turf used to be part of the dinner. The dining room had been sacrosanct in terms of hands-off, no extra fees, except for liquor.

More than half of Carnival bookings involve more than one state room, no doubt many booked by family groups.

On this day, Jan. 31, in 2000, following a Super Bowl XXXIV party in Atlanta, two people were fatally stabbed in a fight between Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis and his companions and another group of people.
Lewis, then 24, was one of three men charged with murder in the deaths of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24. The charge against Lewis was dropped during the trial, with Lewis pleading guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice and testified against his co-defendants. But the other men were acquitted.
The NFL fined him $250,000 before the start of the 2000 season. Lewis then led the Baltimore Ravens to the Super Bowl XXXV title Jan. 28, 2001.
Lewis and the Ravens are playing for Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday.

Gina McCarthy, President Obama’s nominee to replace Lisa Jackson as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has stonewalled Congress about the clean air rules she has been developing, according to lawmakers who demand access to “secret data” pertaining to the regulations.
“EPA has continually refused to make public the basic scientific data underlying virtually all of the Agency’s claimed benefits from new Clean Air Act (CAA) rules,” Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, wrote in a sharp letter to McCarthy, who oversees the development of CAA regulations.
“You,” they continued.
Vitter and Smith fired off the letter today as President Obama nominated McCarthy to serve as EPA administrator. “I think there is nobody who can do a better job in filling Lisa’s shoes permanently than my nominee who’s standing beside me here — Gina McCarthy,” Obama said this morning. “As Assistant EPA Administrator, Gina has focused on practical, cost-effective ways to keep our air clean and our economy growing. She’s earned a reputation as a straight shooter. She welcomes different points of views.”
The Republicans who oversee the EPA are less confident that McCarthy is a “straight shooter,” despite Obama’s comment.
“The EPA’s new CAA regulations are expected to be some of the most costly the federal government has ever issued,” Vitter and Smith wrote today. “Relying on secret data to support these rules is not acceptable. The public and outside scientists must be able to independently verify the EPA’s claims, especially when the results are contradicted by so many other studies.”
Jackson resigned earlier this year — a common enough move for veterans of a first-term administration. But her resignation also came, incidentally, as Congress and the EPA inspector general were investigating her use of a secret email account to conduct official EPA business under the alias, Richard Windsor.

A Herndon father shot and killed his wife and two teenage boys before taking his own life, Fairfax County police said Wednesday.
The preliminary investigation found that 57-year-old Albert Peterson shot each member of his family in the upper body inside their home at 13391 Point Rider Lane.
The bodies were discovered by police Tuesday morning after co-workers called authorities to say their colleague had not shown up for work in two days.
Killed were Albert Peterson, 52-year-old Kathie Peterson, and their two children, 16-year-old Matt, a sophomore at Westfield High School, and 13-year-old Chris, a Rachel Carson Middle School student.
The Northern Virginia community was trying to come to grips with the deaths.
The head of Blackbird Technologies in Herndon, where Kathie Peterson worked in procurement, said in a statement that employees there were "still trying to absorb the shock of this tragedy."
"[Kathie] will be remembered as a high-energy, devoted parent who always had a smile to share," CEO Peggy Styer said. "She often told stories about her sons, their sports and community activities. She is already missed."
The Petersons' church, the Floris United Methodist Church in Herndon, organized a candlelight vigil for Wednesday night. "Everyone is feeling a great deal of grief over this loss," Rev. Tom Berlin said, "and is searching for answers that are not known at this time."
Students, teachers and staff at Westfield High School, where the Matthew was a sophomore, held a tearful prayer circle Wednesday morning. Many of the students wore black as a tribute to the victims.
During the day, classmates took photos of empty chairs and desks where Matt or Chris would normally be sitting, and put them out in social media.
Matt's teammates on the wrestling team tried to cope with the loss of their cheerful teammate.
"Matt was honestly the greatest kid alive... always had a smile on his face.. and the best teammate always encouraging us," wrote @eddiepark1.
The Petersons, who lived on the corner of the entrance to the cul de sac, were described as the neighborhood greeters, often seen on their porch, grilling or kicking around a soccer ball.
Neighbors say they last saw the Peterson family at a community picnic.
Alvaro Lopes also told WNEW that Albert Peterson had been suicidal and had also been taking heart medication that may have altered his moods.
'He seemed dizzy... just different,' Lopes said. 'Hearing about what happened today made me think that could have something to do with it.'
The news of the murder-suicide comes two years to the day that another Westfield student was killed in a high-profile case.
Bo Rupp died Sept. 26, 2010 after he darted out in traffic and was struck by a vehicle in Centreville. Rupp, 15, was also a sophomore who wrestled, as well as played football and lacrosse.
Rupp's family sued the company that makes the alcoholic beverage Four Loko, saying the death contributed to his death.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota researchers will soon get text messages from dead moose.
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said Friday it will conduct research aimed at better understanding the sharp decline in the state's moose population. Through a combination of GPS technology and implanted devices, researchers think they can get a quicker handle on the locations and causes of moose deaths.
Researchers believe the study has value beyond the iconic giant of the north woods, because the ailments killing moose could shed light on health threats to other species, including humans.
Starting later this month, wildlife resource officials plan to capture 100 adults and 50 calves in northeastern Minnesota. All of them will be fitted with $2,500 tracking collars and many will also have $900 mortality implant transmitters put in their digestive tracts.
Those with the implants will be the most valuable research targets because when an animal's heart stops beating it will trigger an instant text message to researchers, who will get coordinates for finding the carcass to help them retrieve it within 24 hours. That's key because moose organs decompose quickly or the animals get ravaged by prey, meaning researchers can't get a good read on what's causing them to die.
"We know the population is declining. We don't know exactly why," said Lou Cornicelli, the DNR's wildlife research manager.
Alerts from the moose with only GPS collars will go out if there is inactivity for more than six hours. Cornicelli compared the technology to "life alert" necklaces some senior citizens use to summon emergency responders. "It actually sends a text message to researchers saying, 'Hey, I'm likely dead.'"
Under older technology, it could take a week to 10 days to find the dead animal. Even if scavengers get to the dead moose first, the new equipment will log key vital statistics as well as ambient temperatures.
Last year there were an estimated 4,200 moose in the state — about half as many as there were in a 2006 species survey. Moose can live as long as 20 years but most die much sooner. Erika Butler, a wildlife veterinarian, pointed to a troubling trend of more moose dying in what should be their prime years and in seasons that are typically more favorable to their health.
The equipment and resulting data will actually feed into multiple studies. The two main studies are expected to cost a combined $1.6 million, with much of the money coming from a special trust fund devoted to environment and natural resources programs.
Butler said the moose research could have human health implications. She cited prior studies of moose carcasses that alerted health officials to the existence of a strain of mosquito-borne encephalitis that could threaten horses and people.
Officials said they may not be able to reverse conditions causing the moose population decline, but they hope the research will allow them to mitigate things.
"You want to understand what's going on," said moose project leader Glenn DelGiudice. "You can't just try to manage by the seat of the pants."

In our rush to succeed we often find
ourselves out of balance with our
general well-being… and looking a
bit tired as well. Both can be easily
remedied with strategically timed spa
visits. Here are some of the city's more
interesting options.
ANNE SÉMONIN SIGNATURE FACIAL
THE SPA AT THE FOUR SEASONS
Just in time for spring, the latest luxury
offered by the Four Seasons spa is the Anne
Sémonin Signature Facial, an intensive,
customized treatment designed to pamper and
heal according to your skin type. The Fours
Seasons is the only Washington spa to provide
the Anne Sémonin line.
To begin, an esthetician performs an
analysis of your skin to customize the
ingredients just for you. The Purifying Facial
for sensitive skin, for example, features a
seaweed exfoliation mask that's applied and
gently brushed off by hand - a European
alternative to the standard method of rinsing
off the mask with water. A relaxing cloud of
steam follows to help open up pores, with
a high frequency wand to soothe the skin
and stimulate blood flow to the muscles of
the face. The most memorable part of the
experience lies in the aromatic ingredients
- rose, geranium, lavender and sage are but a
few - and the ever-changing sensation of each
application on your face. Next, a customized
mask is painted on; in the purifying treatment,
this contains such natural ingredients as sea
cabbage and sea water concentrated in trace
elements, mixed with essential oils such as
lavender, cypress, ylang ylang and palmarosa.
To finish the purifying facial, a pure trace
cream containing seaweed and macadamia nut
oil is rubbed into the skin.
Inside tip: From May 8th to 13th, Anne Sémonin
will be at the spa along with European facialist
Erwa Berkman. It's part of a new "Four Faces
of the Four Seasons" program that introduces
seasonally customized skin treatments.
"Summer Solstice" is the first of the specialized
facials. ñShweta Govindarajan

OLAVIE LE VIN CHARDONNAY BODY THERAPY
I SPA AT THE WILLARD INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL
From the moment you enter the Willard
InterContinental's flower-filled lobby, you sense
you will be in good hands. Located in one of
Washington's most historic hotels, the Willard I
Spa beckons with its newest series of treatments
featuring chardonnay grape seed extract (imported
from the Burgundy region of France) combined
with essential oils.
Highly recommended is The Olavie Le Vin
Chardonnay treatment line-in particular, the
Chardonnay Body Therapy. Trust me: You've
never had white wine quite like this. The treatment
begins with a white grape seed sugar exfoliating
scrub followed by a soothing coat of wine body
butter. Next, you're cocooned in a warm towel
soaked in Willard Chardonnay and wine is poured
over the length of your body, after which you're
covered in a blanket to help your skin retain the
softening antioxidants of the wine therapy. Perhaps
the most exhilarating element of the treatment is
washing away dead skin cells in the I Spa's 12-jet
shower, a truly oceanic experience.
The I Spa features an extensive menu of
services, so if wine therapy already feels old
hat, try a soothing rose milk bath to calm and revive lifeless skin instead, or the Hot Stone Bio-
Morphosis Signature Facial that combines the
effects of heated stones with a seaweed matrix
mask that nourishes and hydrates dry skin.
Inside tip: Before running off on your next errand,
savor the sensation with a little more relaxation
by enjoying a refreshing plate of fruit sushi and a
pot of Numi flowering tea, served in the women's
lounge. ñShweta Govindarajan

ABHYANGAM MASSAGE
PARMA SPA
Parma Spa takes an eastern approach to health
and wellness by basing its treatments on the
principles of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian science
that uses the five elements - earth, air, fire, water
and space - to restore a natural balance in the
body by eliminating impurities. Parma's holistic
approach offers clients a total body experience
that not only awakens the five senses but also
works with your unique body chemistry to create
an individualized experience.
I decided to try to the Abhyangam massage,
a full body treatment illustrative of the spa's
Ayurvedic mission. During the Abhyangam
therapy, a heated mixture of oils, including some
imported from India, is rhythmically kneaded
into the skin to remove toxins and promote
relaxation. From there, the course of the massage
depends on your personal condition. To soothe
tight, knotted muscles, for example, warm sand
packs infused with detoxifying herbs are rubbed
up and down the length of your back, arms and
legs, gently easing soreness. Perhaps the highlight
of the treatment comes right at the beginning: A
therapeutic foot soak in an authentic copper basin
sure to revive your aching arches.
Inside tip: For one-stop-shopping, let Parma's
team of medical doctors and specialists meet your
wellness needs with both alternative and traditional
medicine. Parma offers a host of dermatological
procedures as well as referrals for a range of
medical services, including gynecology, cardiology
and oncology. ñShweta Govindarajan

GET PERSONAL
SOMA FIT
There was a time when sprawling gyms were
in. The busy hubbub of people coming and
going after their workouts created an infectious
buzz that made tramping along in a line of 30
treadmills somehow enjoyable - I still don't get
what people see in those places (other than lots
of other sweaty people, of course). At Soma Fit,
you'll find a haven of everything not "chaingym":
personable staff, personalized attention and
most importantly, personal space.
The hybrid fitness center and day spa is housed
in a minimalist orange and warm-wood-designed
8,500-square-foot space just above Georgetown.
Need a personal trainer? Check. Yoga and Pilates
classes? Check. Nutrition counseling followed by a
muscle-relaxing massage and facial? Check, check,
check. On this day, I'm booked for a 50-minute
SomaFit Body Massage with Larry ($95), and
a SomaFit Signature Facial with Hiromi ($95).
"Jazz, New Age or Classical?" Larry asks as I slip
under a warm blanket. "Jazz," I say. On request,
he spends extra time on my tight shoulders.
Afterwards, I sleep walk over to my facial with
Reiki-trained esthetician Hiromi, who has a way
of combining signature facials with mommyisms:
"Did you wear Sunscreen today," she asks
(knowing I didn't). "No," I respond guiltily. She
chides me: "Tsk, tsk, you should always wear
sunscreen. You want to look young, don't you?"
The Signature Facial itself consists of a thorough
cleansing with steam, exfoliation, and a custom
mask followed by a face massage. It's one of ten
different facials SomaFit offers. There is definitely
something to be said for having your gym, spa
(and Mom) all under the same roof.
Inside Tip: Get there early for your spa
treatment so you can enjoy a personalized
training session (50-minute session from $68 to $80).

MASSENA Construction on the Parker Avenue bridge wont begin for at least two more years, according to state Department of Transportation officials.
Corroded beams on the 53-year-old bridge over the Grasse River forced the closure of two of its four lanes in 2009. The bridge was closed entirely for part of the summer of 2010 after a hole appeared in the deck of the structure.
DOT presented five options for replacing the bridge with a two-lane span to the village board more than a year ago. The total cost of the bridge construction and traffic reconfiguration is $14.1 million to $14.5 million for all five scenarios, DOT officials said previously.
About 80 percent of the project cost would come from federal funds, while the state would pick up the remaining 20 percent. At the time, DOT officials said the bridge project would be highly contingent on Congress passing additional transportation legislation in 2011. In May 2011, DOT officials said they planned to approve design plans last fall, contract plan completion in winter 2012, contract letting in spring 2013, bridge reopening to traffic in fall 2014 and completion in winter 2014.
Now, it will be 2014 or later before construction begins because of a lack of funding, DOT spokesman Michael R. Flick said Monday.
Design work has been limited, Mr. Flick said in an email.
The bridge replacement project will need a fully funded federal transportation bill to move forward, said Scott A. Docteur, director of planning and management for DOT Region 7. The last transportation bill expired several years ago, and Congress has approved nine extensions since then. DOT has received approximately 30 percent less funding from the extensions than the last full-fledged bill, he said.
Were working on it and we want to replace it, but funding is an issue, Mr. Docteur said.
Mayor James F. Hidy said the village had been left in the dark about the delay. He said he was first hearing of it Monday.
Im hearing this through the press. They made no effort at all to let us know whats going on. That itself is disturbing, Mr. Hidy said. Its imperative we get this structure to the front of the line and address this as soon as possible.
Mr. Hidy called the bridge unsightly. If its crumbling on the outside, chances are its not doing too good on the inside, either, he said.
DOT staff has monitored the bridge over the last year, according to engineer and project manager Michael K. McCullouch. Its in a holding pattern, he said. Were watching it, but its still safe.

These two should never see the light of day except from a cell. This young lady will never EVER see the light of day again. The parents will live in pain and agony the rest of their lives as will any brothers and sisters if she has any. Eventually the cell population will take care of them.

The most saddening tragedy. My prayers and love to Autumn's family and friends. As a mom, I can not imagine how they are coping. Autumn looked liked any little girl in any town. A girl with a smile and a spirit of innocence. A sweet beautiful girl who lost her life for a bicycle. SENSELESS.
My heart bleeds tears for the mom of those boys who had the grace and presence of faith to stand tall in what must have been the darkest horror. May we all keep her in our prayers too.
And those boys, well there is nothing that can be said other than may they never close or open their eyes without suffering the pain they inflicted on Autumn, her family and their mom.

This is such a sensitive situation. Our first thought is to kill those teens. I get it... It's mine too. But there is another family also losing 2 children with that thought process. This is beyond tragic. No happy ending. Autumns parents will live in Hell for the rest of their lives. The teens mother has also been sentenced to a life term. Really no way of appeasing everyone . Thoughts and many prayers

Not sure of your thought process (which really bothers me) but as a parent of a 10 year old daughter I have no sympathy for those boys. Autumn is NEVER coming back - her life was snuffed out by 2 thugs! This was a SENSELESS crime over a bike. Those boys made their decision and knew exactly what they were doing when they lured her into their home. Their mother has to deal with that. I hope they are tried as adults because they don't deserve to walk the streets again. I couldn't (nor wouldn't) want to imagine what Autumn's parents are going through right now.

Tara, you have got to be kidding.... something is wrong in that house if 2 brothers can kill a little girl no matter what she is doing. Like a disease or pest in your home you will do whatever it takes to destroy it, kill these bastards, they are a disease in our society. A 52 year old father is dead today for no reason because they let out a lunatic from prison that was supposedly rehabilitated, this happens thousands and thousands of times,These people can't be fixed, they are wired wrong. We all are living in hell because of these left minded moron's that find every way possible to make our society and the human race less safe, but if grandma needs surgery...nahh you lived long enough. Destroy those in the middle east that would kill us and their own people instead of playing police officer, execute those that would kill another human without good cause, imprison those that can't follow our laws as a free society, help those that have contributed to our society in a positive way, and send all the lefties to europe to fight over whatever scrap of money there is left over there and make sure it airs prime time so we can watch. Everyone is sick and tired of having to lock up their children out of fear, wake up every morning in fear they might lose their job, go to bed every night in fear the government will take away everything they worked for. Enough fear people, it's time to get back control of our country and a civil society.

Pete I am not sure what Fred may have meant, but we also have to consider he may not feel comfortable saying black or African American, or dark complexion, I have many black friends who tell me that "black" upsets some people, "African American" upset some who don't associate their past to Africa, and others who feel that people don't run around saying "dark complexion"or "light complexion" "so why not just call me black". In a country whos own government has pitted it's citizens against eachother, we no longer feel comfortable talking to someone or about someone who may be different in other ways, wether it be race, religion, political point of view, or financial status. I will give Fred the benefit of the doubt and hope he just felt uncomfortable saying something he thought might offend..

Donna Colucci
11:37 am on Wednesday, October 24, 2012
I certainly don't know if I believe in public hangings, however, I do think that years gone by they handled their punishments very much different and perhaps much more effective. While visiting Williamsburg we were told that first offense petty criminals were put to public humiliation, (love that) second offense they had their earlobes nailed to the post, and the third was death. Sounds like a plan to me.
Honestly I would hope they learned after the public humiliation...but I do vote for that to be brought back again. Unfortunately kids, and criminals today, I believe have no fear. They fear no God or fear of consequences. Tie them up to a pole with a sign that speaks their crime...and let the public take care of him.

Really!!!! your talking about two kids, that probably made a huge mistake that they can't take back. My heart goes out to all the families in this situation. If it were your children i'm sure you wouldn't refer to them as animals, savages or scum. Grow up and be adults. It's a L for all involved.

This poor girl, her family and the two boys and their family deserve a much more through investigation of the circumstances. There is no quick or simple solution here.
Me
9:32 am on Wednesday, October 24, 2012
The difference between sentencing them to death and letting them live is rehabilitation. Do you honestly think they could ever contribute to society after this? So if they get 50 years in prison, the question is, should tax payers have to pay for their food, lodging, security, etc.? Honestly, I would rather see these kids, and probably the parents of these kids, rot.

The two boys have been identified by neighbors etc - their names are all over the internet. They are Dante and Jutsin Robinson. They are two black boys. While I do not believe, based on the news reports, this had anyting to do with race, I would just like to point out that if the tables were turned and the victim was black, there would be marching in the streets.The fact is this is a horrible situation and there is more than one vicitm here. Autumn, her family and friends and the family and friends of the alleged murderers. While I believe that everyone is responsible for their actions I have to ask, what went so very wrong in the lives of these boys that would make them capable of such a horrible crime?

If the boys were white every storefront pastor and church bus would be heading to sought jersey to protest..... I bet these two punks already had records.

Nice job Mike! Right on the money. To all who think someone who murders can be rehabilitated? You must be insane yourself. They can't even understand the simplicity of right and wrong. If they didn't get it before they murdered, they never will! Put them in jail on the taxpayers dime, wasting oxygen, working out, watching television all day. That's rehabilitation in prison. It's another justice system failure. Just look at the repeat offender statistics. Like Mike said, too many convicted murderers still living and not executed. To (0) and moist cake, this isn't a political, race, or the most ridiculous comparison Taliban issue! These are children who killed for a bicycle. They need to be punished as adults is the most harsh of ways. Problem with New Jersey is the death penalty doesn't exist. These two need to ride the lightening. No such thing as rehab for a murderer! Comparing someone who believes in the death penalty to the Taliban is ludicrous!

I guess you could have just said, this is not the place for politics, but I would have answered the same way... yes it is, this is the perfect place... to stand up for this poor little girl and remember that our failings in our politics and our laws may have contributed to her losing her life, this is the perfect place for us to speak for those whom can no longer, thanks to a percentage of people who's out of wack moral compass leads to more and more children like Autumn being hurt, abused and murdered, this is the perfect place for Autumn to let us know this will no longer be tolerated and that her voice may be silenced but she will be heard. This is the perfect place for you, me and all the rest of us to realize we failed this little girl and many like her and it will not be tolerated, we are not going to allow the young and the innocent to be wiped out, while we protect and coddle the scum and the entitled. They felt they had a right to her bike, they felt they had the right to take her life, It's my right to help make laws that will take their life when they feel so entitled to take anothers.

Russian Prof. Panarin predicted the collapse of America's financial might, 15 years ago and everyone laughed, funny how no one is lauging now and interview him on a regular basis wanting to know where he got his data from, of course he can't tell anyone because he even admits the data came from the Kremlin, but maybe take a little time off from drinking beer, watching msnbc and praying to Obama, and read up a little on what is going on around you.

May Autumn rest in peace and my deepest sympathy to her parents, her family, and friends.
I applaud the courageous act of the mother of those murderers who turned them in to authorities. She must be going through a terrible heartache as well! Her boys have not obviously followed her example in life. So, please let's stop with "the woe is me" environmental lifestyle justification excuse for these 2 boys, or, the " we need to examine what happened to the 2 boys to have made them commit such a horrific crime." Too much psychoanalysis in society today and not enough ownership/responsibility for a person's/child's actions. These two boys are responsible for their own actions and must pay. It's as simple as that.
I would bet that the 15 year old will say the 17 year old did it and vice-versa and that their attorneys would create reasonable doubt to warrant them serving hardly any time at all. We need to hear & know the truth, but unfortunately, it does not always work in today's society. I truly hope that in this case, justice will be served to Autumn and to the respective families.

I think that the US government should take these 2 criminals..and most criminals and send them to a third world country. The USA can give them $50,000. And the leaders of this third world country will put them to work! Yes WORK! Let them build water ways and roads and HELP people and do good for once in their lives.

No one here knows anything about whether there was a racial component here. No one. Perhaps there was. Perhaps there wasn't. One thing is for sure, the race of the alleged perpetrators does not seem to be being widely reported.

My initial take when hearing the story was the obvious...brutal, horrific, why...beasts killing a fawn. I also thought and stated that I gave the boys mother credit for turning her boys in. After a couple of days of reading further updates, I still give their mother credit for her actions. But I would be curious, upon investigation, hearing what kind of home they came from...kids don't simply turn into cold blooded, calculating killers overnight. I (and I'm sure Autumn's parents could really care either) whether they were black, white or plaid. I'm unsure of how that is relevant. An innocent little girl is gone at the hands of very young monsters.

I think we have another problem here in addition to the unfathomable crime that was committed on this poor innocent angel.
I think the perps should do life in solitary, lose their minds in about 5 years and just wallow in their cells looking at the wonderful world of a blank wall. Losing their life is too easy.
The other problem I see, is wonderful Americans who are sick and tired of having to be politically correct, sick and tired of being accused of racism where a minority is involved and sick and tired of having to be careful of what they say because they might offend someone.
This is still America (last time I looked). and a bum is still a bum. That homeless crap went out in my lingo years ago. A bad criminal is a bad criminal - race has nothing to do with it.
Let us pray for the FAMILIES of the perps and the victims....and relish in the fact, that they were caught and justice will be done.

With that said, no wonder an unfortunate few grow up to become monsters if all they know is hate.
Rather it be Autumn Pasquale or Treyvon Martin, both are children who died violently and that should be the discussion!!! The main concern should be how can we protect our children, not mommy and daddy's generalizations of a whole group of people. My prayers go out to Autumn and her family.

To Tee Smith: Here is what the Spath / Pannell case has to do with Autumn and her alleged killers. If two white youths had killed a young black girl; certain (community and political) leaders would be all over the media and in Clayton letting everyone know that justice is needed and that the girl was targeted (because of her color). Go back to that night in Teaneck: I was driving past the church when the Memorial service was letting out and you could see anger in the eyes of those leaving (the church). Shortly thereafter the riot started; funny thing is that we do not see riots or politicians grandstanding when the stituation is reversed (like here). PS: we know that Philip Pannell had a criminal record, was a member of a (drug) gang, was carrying a weapon and attempted to shoot at the police (prior to him being shot).

Some further questions: Why did the storeowners on Teaneck Road had to have their store windows smashed? Did they do anything wrong? Same applies to the cars that were vandalized. As I said before, I was in Teaneck that night and following nights as a member of the New Jersey Army National Guard. As has been stated, what would be the case if two white youths had killed an innocent girl of the opposite race? You tell me. Both cases are tragedies for all of the families involved as well as their respective communities.

A city council official in Holland is strongly suggesting to residents that they urinate at the same time that they take their daily showers. Bert Wassink says urinating while showering “saves lots of clean water and is good for the environment.” He goes on to say “If you combine showers and peeing, you save a lot of water and money, so why not?” Residents in the United Kingdom and Brazil have also been encouraged to adopt this practice. If this idea takes off, could towns in this country be next?

Honors and Awards: Richard Reimold Scholarship, Best actor '09 - '10 (faculty vote), Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival Irene Ryan Regional Champion, Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theater half tuition scholarship
Matthew Bagley started his college career at Manchester Community College, where he took two courses during one semester. When asked what made him transfer to WCSU, the seasoned performer doesn't miss a beat: "In 2006, Western's theatre department was putting up 'The Full Monty' and I couldn't miss out on a chance at being naked in front of 500 people."
Bagley says he's loved theater "since I was a little kid," so pursuing it as his major "just made sense." In fact, he says, "I loved it so much I stuck around for five years before graduating."
Besides his memorable performance in 'The Full Monty," Bagley has tackled everything from Chekhov to Shakespeare; drama to musicals. He credits Professor of Theatre Arts Sal Trapani and the entire faculty of the WCSU theatre department with helping him develop his craft to the extent that he was named a Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival Irene Ryan Acting Competition Regional Champion.
Asked what he will remember most about his WCSU experience, Bagley says, "It has to be being the first WCSU student in history to go to Washington, D.C., to compete for the Irene Ryan National Theater Scholarship.”
After graduation, Bagley says, "I hope to get signed at the WCSU New York showcase, and then move on to a lucrative career in either Broadway, film or television."
Bagley’s advice to new students entering WCSU is: “I don't know ... try to get done in four years."

Of course!
A bishop can use either Use to ordain. And a deacon is a deacon is a deacon.
From a reader:

Of course!
A bishop can use either Use to ordain. And a deacon is a deacon is a deacon.

A note, I think, should be made here: Summorum Pontificum did not pertain to ordinations; all other sacraments, however, are mentioned. Nevertheless, I suppose a society like the FSSP would have permission to ordain a permanent deacon in the extraordinary form.
Any bishop can chose to use the older Pontifical.
Ooh Father, your gonna make the SSPX real unhappy [So?] …
They even say the Eastern Catholics and Orthodox have this wrong. All clerics, even deacons, have to be celibate… who knew… ;-)
BTW I found a link to that article on their Latin Mass explained packet page. I was looking for Altar server training stuff and I came across this in the little note attached to the check box for deacon that said they wont send the material to permenant deacons and they gave a link to this article.
It really astonishes me that they have such a problem with married clerics…
While I can see no problem with priestly ordinations being carried out in the Extraordinary Form outside the FSSP/ICRSP etc. (because the ordinand will in any case be a deacon), might there not be a problem with a diaconal ordination, given that the older books presume the ordinand to be a subdeacon?
Father Z,
Is there a translation of the EF Rite of Ordination to the diaconate on-line?
I wondered about the position of the SSPX on ordaining married men to the diaconate. Can I say that I am not surprised?
Fr. Deacon Daniel
You do realize that when your wife dies you may NOT re-marry. I believe the reason that, with very few exceptions, all high orders may not be married is you are esentially marrying the church. You can not have two brides. It would be unfair to your wife/children to spend more time with Church duties. On the other side of the coin it would be unfair to the Church for you to choose issues of your family over the needs of the Church.
These are the reasons that I was taught why all high orders must only be for unmarried/widowed men. Even then, if there are children, it can be very difficult for a widowed man to have to choose between the Church and a problem with a child.
The few exceptions have traditionally been married Anglican’s and other’s who have vaild orders and wish to enter the Roman Catholic Church and are currently married.
I urge everyone interested in the married cleric discussion to read canonist Dr. Edward Peter’s blogpost:.
I quote his post below. Go to his site for links and further discussion.
“Brian Van Hove, SJ, and Dcn. Rex Pilger are debating in the Homiletic and Pastoral Review whether the obligation of clerical continence (1983 CIC 277) applies to married permanent deacons. Van Hove argues affirmatively, Pilger negatively. My 2005 article on this question has been cited approvingly by Van Hove, but I have not intervened in the HPR discussion because, until recently, my work had not been challenged by either side. Recently, however, Pilger attempted to refute several points that I made or accept concerning.”
To the commenter above, do you honestly think that the ordained deacon that you presume to lecture doesn’t already know this? Both the comment and its TONE (note the font) are just a little unnecessary. The disrespect here sometimes is unbelievable.
Arent Deacons assumed with the role of subdeacon though? I mean I have never seen a permanent deacon be addressed as during his formation subdeacon, but what I do know is there is a maronite church in St Louis, that has Married Sub Deacons, So I would assume it is there. Granted that is a different rite, but still part of the cahtolic church.
Now, I do have a question. If a deacon is a deacon is a deacon, can the deacon perform his office in the Extraordinary form? I only ask because when the extraordinary form was ordinary, The permanent diaconate was somewhat in reclusion, and I have not seen/ known a permanent married deacon that participated in the extraordinary form. Maybe its just the seed isnt there yet, but I am curious. I am 29, and in a few years God willing I can enter formation myself. I am married. I would love to know if I could expect to participate at the altar in both forms though.
I wonder who the pioneer will be in this regard?!
:) Well, Chances are someone might beat me to it, I have 6 years before i can enter formation, and its atleast a 4 year process right now. (so ordination possibly at 39?)
I would think the problem with a permanent deacon doing it, would be he is assigned to a parish, so it would all be dependent on father, if in fact the faculties allow it
Matthew,
Yes, I am quite aware, thank you very much, of my own obligations towards celibacy should my wife pass away.
Dispensations to be remarried have been granted in the Latin Church for widower deacons with young children. This has also happened in certain Eastern Catholic Churches, although never with our married priests. There was a case with the Antiochian Orthodox where a widower priest was granted a “dispensation” (they do not use such terminology) to remarry after his wife died. His name is Father John Allen and he wrote about his experience in the book, “Widower Priest”.
The imagery of espousal, while very beautiful, does not present the total picture of the apostolic life. St. Paul’s exhortation to St. Timothy assumes that some of those called to sacerdotal or diaconal ministry have an intimate familiarity with the married state and family life as fathers and husbands and that how they have raised their children is a witness in discerning their worthiness for ordained ministry in the household of faith. The Scriptures and Tradition praise both the married and the celibate states, and the recent magisterium (both conciliar and pontifical) have upheld the legitimate and praiseworthy ministry of married priests and deacons in the East.
Quite frankly, I tire of uber-Latinists who seem to treat this question as if it was somehow material to the faith. Celibacy for the Kingdom of God is a discipline and a beautiful and praiseworthy calling “for those who can bear it.” The married state is as well, and both states have an eschatalogical dimension to them and priesthood and diaconate can be exercised well in both. The Church does not have a two-tiered system of clergy – the “high and mighty” celibates and the barely tolerable “married’s.” Both are fruitful in their own way and both states have been approved by the Church.
In ICXC,
Fr. Deacon Daniel
From the Latin Canon 277:
“The diocesan bishop is competent to establish more specific norms concerning this matter and to pass judgment in particular cases concerning the observance of this obligation.”
A question for Canon Lawyers: Can the bishop thus dispense a cleric who entered the clerical state as a married man from perpetual continence?
This is an interesting debate on this canon. I have always had the understanding that the obligation is to be observed 24 hours before rendering liturgical service, as well as during certain periods of fasting.
There is also a tradition of continence for the laity prior to receiving Holy Communion and during periods of fasting. I wonder if such a thing is being advocated anywhere!
Fr. Deacon Daniel
If any bishop can use the older Pontifical, then why is ordination not included in Summorum Pontificum when Confirmation is?
Now, I do have a question. If a deacon is a deacon is a deacon, can the deacon perform his office in the Extraordinary form?
It has been done – is being done, if that answers your question. The St. Frances de Sales Parish in the archdiocese of Atlanta, served by the FSSP, has an assigned permanent deacon.
xathar: Because it didn’t have to be.
I think what we should hope/work/pray for is that knowledge of the EF becomes part of the normal liturgical formation of candidates for the permanent diaconate. The more who know, the more who will be able to help their bishop & pastors respond to the requests of the faithful. And I think many will be attracted to it with exposure. Members of EF communities who could assist with training should prayerfully consider contacting their diocesan Director of Deacon Formation.
Thanks for the answer to my question. I hope by the time I enter formation and God willing recieve my orders to the permanent diaconate, the question will no longer have to be asked. Now wouldnt that be something, keeping up with the brick by brick thought. At that point we would have a mansion!
The following comes from the SSPX’s article in opposition to married deacons.
.”
Canon 3 of the Council of Nicea is (from newadvent.org):
The great Synod has stringently forbidden any bishop, presbyter, deacon, or any one of the clergy whatever, to have a subintroducta dwelling with him, except only a mother, or sister, or aunt, or such persons only as are beyond all suspicion.
Ok, from what I can tell, a “subintroducta” is a celibate woman, or perhaps an unrelated woman, not a wife. So the council excluded clergy from living with celibate/unrelated women who were not their mothers, etc. It doesn’t say anything about an absolute prohibition against clergy being married as the SSPX seems to indicate.
Is my understanding of the term subintroducta correct? Is the SSPX’s initial bit of evidence completely off the mark, or am I misunderstanding the meaning of the words?
Wow. Has the SSPX, then, become a kind of reverse barometer? Anything “they” are for, “we” are against?
No, the SSPX is not some sort of reverse barometer? Some things they get right, but it would be insane to trust the statements of a group of people whose fullness of communion with the the Church is questionable when those statements are obviously in opposition to what the Church allows.
They’ve claimed something. Is it true or not?
They also state in the same.”
They, the SSPX by posting this on their website, have declared that married deacons are excommunicated. This has nothing to do with reality. It is nonsense.
JM,?
Well,
All one has to do is read scripture, Paul tells us presbetyrs, bishops, deacons should have only been married once. No where does it say they have to be removed from the wife, the wife is dead, or anything else one could think of. So one can assume the wife very well can “come along” so to speak
Granted, that in any rite bishops are celibate, priests in the east can be ordained if they are married , but must be celibate if they are ordained and not married, but if one really wanted a strong ground to stand on, its directly in scripture. Though in that thought its important to recognize why we have a celibate priesthood in the Latin Tradition.
I think a permanent deacon, by its very nature of service (If I recall the word means that), would almost be better suited to be married. It gives him a unique perspective on the average faithful, who are married, and that (all due respect to the priests here), that a priest isnt always going to have. Many permanent deacons work with marriage prep and counseling, and so forth. I would think that its pretty obvious why that’s a good thing. Also , I mean no disrespect to the priests who visit here, just pointing it out as an obvious advantage for helping the faithful. I love whatever pastor has been placed in care over me, but I wont hide that I often have stronger personal relationships with the deacons who are installed at the church. Part of that is having someone to talk to, being a married man. I think the church in her wisdom, and care for the faithful sees this, and thus why we have married permanent deacons
Michael,
?”
This has nothing to do with the question I asked? Is the SSPX’s understanding the of the 3rd Canon of the Council of Nicea correct or not? From what I can tell, it isn’t. They are wrong. But my understanding might be correct or incorrect and I’m hoping that someone who reads this blog might more about the issue.
In response to your comment above: In the case of married deacons, the SSPX isn’t exhorting anyone to do more than the Church allows. What they are doing is claiming, by the posting of the article on their website, is that what the Church allows, married deacons, is causing these men who are licitly and validly ordained to the diaconate to be excommunicated. Obviously, they are opposing the Church in the matter and making claims that are false on top of it. There is nothing wrong with doing more than the Church recommends or even advising people to do so. Going to Mass more than once a week is generally going to be a good thing. Fasting more if you are capable can be a good thing. These are both things that SSPX priests would likely recommend, and I support both of those, but their opposition to married deacons is not the same thing.
How do we know that any bishop can use the old Pontifical? Has this been decreed anywhere?
“How do we know that any bishop can use the old Pontifical? Has this been decreed anywhere?”
yes, the through the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum. As such, it is on the pope’s authority, and no other decree needs to be in place for a Bishop to perform it.
Its a mass, the faithful can request their sacraments be administered in the extraordinary form. Deacons, and for that much any person recieving the sacrament(so even a priest who say wanted last rites on his death bed), constitutes a “member of the faithful”.
Patrick,
What you’ve written is not correct. Summorum Pontificum speaks of allowing all sacraments in the older form except for ordination. Additionally, the ability to use the older books (MIssal, Breviary, Ritual) is not extended to the Pontifical in that document. I repeat: Where, if anywhere, has permission been granted to use the older form of the Pontifical for ordination, carte blanche? [Summorum Pontificum speaks primarily about the faculties which priests have, not about what bishops can do. The issue of the Pontifical was settled a long time ago.]
Perhaps one of our more scholarly folks could answer it then. I would have assumed it was all encompasing. Especially if there are groups like the FSSP who are using it.
To the commenters above:
Summorum Pontificum (“SP”) does not need to mention ordination, and in fact, it makes more sense that SP does not include it. The purpose of SP was to allow priests to perform the EF without permission of a bishop when requested by faithful. To include Holy Orders here was unnecessary as Holy Orders always requires a bishop and is not at the bequest of the faithful (unless the faithful are considered the priests/deacons being ordained). Thus, the bishop can choose which form he uses for the mass. If SP had included a mention of this sacrament it wouldn’t have been congruent with the purpose of the rest of the document.
JM –
I think you’ve got the gist of ‘subintroducta’, at least as I understand it.
I did some google searches, and the assorted references I got back seem to support that understanding.
N.B. – I didn’t post the links here myself, as some of the most informative were part of “relationship” glossary sites. Some of the content might well be described as base or even vulgar.
Thanks YoungCatholicStl . See someone from the midwest helped us out :P
YoungCatholicSTL:
Then how do you account for its mention of confirmation which is the bishop’s domain, so to speak?
Xathar:
Yes, here’s how I see it. (Warning: About to split hairs) While I agree that it is “the bishop’s domain,” the sacrament of confirmation is still at the people’s request. And if those people requesting would like the EF, then they are entitled to it under SP. Holy Orders isn’t at the request of the person to be ordained, it is at the request of the bishop. Although, xathar, I do find your point intriguing.
Fr. Z – Any thoughts?
SP does say that the the usus antiquor was never juridicially abrograted. This is the most important thing to consider when examining if ordinations are allowed with the traditional rubrics. Therefore, since it was never juridicially aborgrated, and a bishop is the custodian of liturgy in his diocese, the bishop may choose to use it for ordinations. SP was particularly meant to free priests to say the TLM should they choose without having to obtain permission from his bishop.
The SSPX seems to have a point here, the points they make are almost the same as the late Cardinal Stickler made in his study “The Case for Clerical Celibacy” He said that from apostolic times all clerics were required to keep perpetual abstinence, even though they might be married. The Eastern Church relaxed the discipline (but they still require sexual abstinence before liturgy). So permanent married deacons without anykind of sexual abstience imposed on them is a novelty.
SP does NOT say that the entire usus antiquor was never abrogated. Rather, it’s focus is primarily on the Missal. It also gives permission for the old Breviary and Ritual. And then, with respect to the Pontifical, it states, “Ordinaries are given the right to celebrate the Sacrament of Confirmation using the earlier Roman Pontifical, if the good of souls would seem to require it.” This is the only line that concerns the Pontifical. Again, no mention is made of ordination. This is a glaring omission and I’m sure it is not a mistake or oversight. Furthermore, note that the use of the old rite of Confirmation is made at the bishop’s discretion, not at the request of the faithful, as an earlier commenter had stated. In conclusion, I see no provision within SP or any other document for a bishop to use the entirety of the older Pontifical at his own discretion, particularly so with respect to ordinations.
Fr. Z,
As I noted above, SP does speak of the Pontifical, but only with regard to Confirmation. You state above that “the issue of the Pontifical was solved long ago.” I’m not familiar with this solution. What document/event are you referring to?
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to find out the truth of all this, about the deaconate,married or otherwise, N.O. or Gregorian Rite E.R. “TLM” all the speculation and all the opinions. Confusion rein on.

From a reader:
I am a lay Catholic and over the month past month I have felt truly
home since going to the Mass of the Ages.
Please forgive my ignorance but the missal of blessed John XXIII has
omitted the prayers at the foot of the altar at certain occasions and
the 2nd confiteor before reception of the Eucharist of the faithful.
Are these changes though indiscernible harmful to the faith or
necessary and part of the organic growth of the Mass?
The 1962 Missale Romanum (the Missal of John XXIII) did not omit the prayers at the foot of the altar, except in the normal circumstances (e.g., Good Friday). And there is a curtailed form in the Requiem Mass.
However, the 1962MR does not have the 2nd Confiteor before Holy Communion. In many places, I would guess most places, it is done anyway regardless.
I don’t think it is harmful to the faithful to omit the 2nd Confiteor. It is not harmful to the faithful to be without the prayers at the foot of the altar.
At the same time, consider that these two elements of the older, traditional form of Mass were omitted in the Novus Ordo even though the Second Vatican Council’s document on liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium said that no changes should be made unless it should be for the true good of the faithful.
I cannot quite make out how the faithful benefit from the removal of those things. They might not necessarily be harmed, but… how do they benefit?
Surely you jest, Father.
I don’t think there was any intention to change only what the good of souls demanded. This becomes blatantly obvious when you begin to itemize the changes and ask, “how were these so harmful that it was necessary to remove them?”
- the dates (and celebration) of most feast days
- the elimination of ember days
- the greatest majority of the texts of the Mass
- the elimination of minor orders and their roles in the liturgy
- the prayers at the foot of the altar
And this list could go on for quite a long time. Remember folks, Bugnini was largely responsible for the document Sacrosanctum Concilium itself, and he knew what the bishops needed to read to get signatures — and he knew how far his ambiguous document could be stretched.
Re: the second Confiteor
A very good priest explained in a class on liturgy a couple of years ago (FSSP), that the second Confiteor was really for the congregation to confess one more time in humility, hoping for the forgiveness of our sins to prepare for Holy Communion. He stressed that we should be saying the Confiteor to ourselves with the altar servers, who are speaking in our name before the “Domine non sum dignus” for the congregation. There is nothing more beautiful, moreover, than the Deacon and Sub-Deacon at a Solemn High Mass, going to either side of the altar, bowing low as the Deacon chants the Confiteor. It is such a beautiful chant. I often find myself chanting it when I’m driving in the car – a little odd maybe – but we can’t confess enough, can we?
At our Latin Masses, no matter which one of the four priests come to say the EF, (not a parish, but assigned priests), all four say the second Confiteor. These priests went to St. John Cantius to learn the EF several years ago. Is this ok? As they all do it, I assumed that is what they were taught to do.
comes not come-sorry
It would be helpful to know WHY there was a second Confiteor in the first place.
Until Pius X encouraged more frequent Communion just over a century ago, Communion of the Faithful was less common. When it was done, it would often occur after Mass. This ritual would begin with the recitation of the Confiteor by the server, followed by the priest holding up the Host for the “Ecce Agnus Dei …” much as would be done in the pre-1962 form of the Traditional Mass. It was not considered part of the Mass proper. In fact, you will not find the Communion of the Faithful in the priest’s missal at the altar, even in the 1962 version. And in most comprehensive hand missals until the late 1950s (Dom Gaspar’s Saint Andrew Missal, etc), it is listed as a separate event in an appendix, in addition to its location in the Mass.
And so, once the Sacrament was more commonly received, the entire ritual was simply inserted after the Communion of the Priest as the norm. Thus the appearance of the “second Confiteor.”
The “second Confiteor” is not in the 1962 Missal, but its continued use is indulged by the Holy See. That it is not officially included, cannot be definitively attributed to any one person, other than perhaps the Holy Father himself, who ultimately approved the change. In all likelihood, it was removed simply because it no longer served its original purpose. On the other hand, a tradition often retains its value after its purpose has faded away. The case could be made either way, without the usual conspiracy theories.
At the parish where I am MC, we do not use it, but its use is brought to the attention of servers in training, and they are told what to do and when, in the event that their experience takes them elsewhere.
Me, I could go either way with it.
I’m curious about our other readers — how many recite the 2nd Confetior quietly to themselves when it is not recited publically??
I must confess that I also say it before receiving Comminion in the Ordinary Form.
At my parish’s EF Masses the servers do not say the 2nd confiteor. I do, however, say the confiteor to myself (followed by a few “SHJ, have mercy…”) as I am in line at the communion rail.
I find that it is a great way to bring clarity to the situation.
I have said it from the time I was Confirmed (1951) along with the alter boys, if the Pope wanted it there I see no right reason to eliminate it.
Being a humble theology student still grappling with the complexities of the pre-novus ordo form(s) of the Mass, I may be about to put my foot in my mouth.
I would probably guess the second confiteor was originally the equivalent (along with the other prayers around it of the Eastern Communion Prayer said in the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. This prayer is a confession of our sins, our unworthiness to receive, and a beseeching of God to heal us.
One could say that in the western rite, it has now been lessened to “O Lord, I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word and I shall be healed.”
With these thoughts in mind, I wouldn’t say that the loss of the second confiteor is harmful in that it does not diminish the action of the sacrifice and we strive to retain it’s sense with “O Lord, I am not worthy…”. I would say, however, that its loss does not maximize the experience of mercy and gift that should accompany reception of the Eucharist. Acknowledging one’s sinfulness in a dramatic way (like the Eastern Communion Prayer) is a sure way to instill in a person the need for examination of conscience and the reminder that receiving unworthily could lead to judgment or condemnation makes one understand the gravity of the sacrament.
Hearing it in a Ruthenian Rite scared the crud out of my mother, born and raised Roman Catholic.
So I don’t think it’s loss is harmful. However, I think its addition, or a prayer akin to it (Eastern Communion Prayer), can do great good.
Fr., I believe the questioner had in mind the various omissions of the prayers at the Foot that were indeed novel ommissions. You say normal, but what is that?
It was not omitted on Palm Sunday, Candlemas, etc until the reform in the 1950′s
Anyhow the 2nd or 3rd Confiteor makes perfect sense to me in light of the historical fact that the confiteor at the beginning is not about the people. The priest confesses, then the other sacred ministers confess. These confessions, like the rest of the prayers at the foot, evolved as prayers said to fill in the time of the introit. Only in a roundabout way, via low Mass, is the idea instilled that it is somehow a confession of the congregation. The original purpose was a confession before entering “in sanctum sanctorum”
Now especially at a sung or Solemn Mass, the 2nd Confiteor is very significant. The people do not hear the earlier ones and, in fact, can be singing the Introit. But this confiteor is explicitly for them. That it was imported a long time go (before Pius X, before Trent in fact) into the Mass from communion given outside of Mass is also true of the Ecce Agnus Dei (which mimics the Agnus Dei) and the Domine non sum dignus following that (mimicking the priest)
The Dominican Rite prior to 1958 did not even have the Ecce Agnus Dei. Very simply the priest receives communion, and has his own Domine non sum dignus, and then proceeds to distribute.
So that it was imported in does not mean that its purpose does not make sense, any more than with the Ecce Agnus Dei
\\I am a lay Catholic and over the month past month I have felt truly
home since going to the Mass of the Ages.\\
And just what are the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and other Eastern Liturgies, to say nothing about the other authorized Western rites, such as the Mozarabic, Bragan, and even Novus Ordo?
Chopped liver?
There was a time that NONE of these liturgies, including the Tridentine Rite, existed, therefore NONE of them can justly be called “the Mass of the Ages”–unless ALL of them (including the Pauline Mass) are.
What Manwithblackhat said about the second (or possibly third) Confiteor is historically true.
As far as frequently repeating this prayer on the grounds that “one can never confess enough,” it can be a symptom of spiritual OCD, otherwise known as scrupulosity.
Sooner or later we have to get our eyes off ourselves and onto God’s forgiveness.
One does wonder how Bugnini got away with all he did, and over and over one asks why Paul VI signed off on the N.O.????
Since the N.O. is the primary Mass I attend accept for a E.F. Mass once a month, an act of Contrition is the prayer one tries to use prior to receiving Our Lord. but food for thought will now start on my own and quietly saying the confiteor to myself.
I can think of a reason why it should be omitted: accusations of disobedience.
For years the 1962 Missal was fought to be “freed” (as popular parlance spoke of the matter). Now that it is “freed” people are not even following its rubrics.
For the sake of consistency of argument, the 2nd confiteor ought not be said.
-KJS
gloriainexcelisdeo — You reminded me of something I’ve been meaning to ask. Does anyone who is familiar with the FSSP’s custom of having the deacon and subdeacon chant the last (2nd/3rd depending on how you count it) Confiteor before communion at High Mass know how that started? The only time it should be chanted (according to my books) is at a pontifical High Mass.
I think it’s noteworthy that Psalm 42 and not the “prayers at the foot of the altar” is what is really in question. This psalm was really a part of the celebrants preparation for Mass and was inserted into the public prayer of the church in the Missal of Trent. The historic liturgies of religious orders (Dominican & Carmelite) do not have this psalm. It was simply the In nomine… Confiteor…kyrie. The Introit is out of place in all of the rites as it ended up right smack in the middle of penitential stuff?! I think “they” tried to fix this. Many orthodox liturgists saw the fault in this. The confiteor before communion is simply out of place too. All the penetential stuff was done at the beginning then we abruptly go back to the confiteor?! All that being said, I wouldn’t say that these things were harmful for anyone.
@Fr. Basil,
)….
IMHO, it’s not an “either/or” matter – either focusing upon ourselves, or focusing upon God.
Instead, it is the Catholic “both/and” – looking at all things realistically – the reality of how sinful we truly are AND how much they truly do offend God infinitely, no matter how “small” they might be – as well as realizing that if we express heartfelt contrition for our sins & aim to make amendment in our lives, God will always extend to us His Mercy and forgiveness.
I agree with Fr. Z – taking out the 2nd Confiteor was NOT clearly beneficial for the laity.

That’s always been my question with the way the new Mass is celebrated (not necessarily how it appears in the missal itself). There are so many things that are optional that “liturgists” choose not to do it simply because they don’t see the point. There is no consideration for any theological reasons other than it’s optional, so why do it at all? Instead, they just add in things or omit what is not optional, thus making it harmful.
I am surprised that others have experienced FSSP priests incorporating this confiteor–at the parish I attended for about two years, I never saw it done. As far as how we benefit from the removal of this confiteor: I don’t know what the benefit necessarily is one way or the other. But, now that it is removed, there is a benefit in simply, obediently doing what’s in the book.
Fr. Z: Doing something “for the true good of the faithful” is one reason changes could be made to the liturgy, but I don’t believe it is the only reason. Sacrosanctum Concilium cited other reasons, such as securing the full and active participation of the people (#14), or if something is shown to be an intrusion which does not harmonize with the inner nature of the liturgy (#21), impedes the faithful from understanding the rites with ease (#21), or is not part of an organic growth when the liturgy is seen historically (#23). In addition, in the revision of the rites, SC calls for a careful investigation into structure and meaning of each part of the liturgy, as well as what is learned from experience of the indults of the Holy See.
If we were to simply go by what is for the “true good of the faithful” almost anything could be inserted into the liturgy. As a rite that communicates grace from outward signs, and signs which must be clear and simple, the liturgy must not present signs which are not merely emotionally fulfilling. What does this part of the Mass do, or accomplish? Is the rite doing this, or have other goals and desires crept in to this part? Is the introductory rite of the Tridentine Mass also the priest’s preparation, and also his contrition of sin, and also the contrition of the ministers, and also the Kyrie, and also the adoration of the Gloria, plus an entrance antiphon (Introit) stuck in between, plus other prayers of humility while kissing the altar, plus, plus, plus ???? So exactly what is this first part of the Mass supposed to accomplish? And if some of these parts were inserted in the 4th, 5th, or 6th centuries, for what reason, and was it true organic growth.
The comment I hear from people in these blogs is “but I feel good when the 2nd confiteor is done. They should never have changed it.” That may sound like a defense of tradition, but it could also be very much a parroting of the liberals’ mindset that we keep things in the liturgy because they feel good. And if that’s the case let’s just ignore the fact that the Missal has dropped the 2nd confiteor, because we don’t have to go along with any change that we don’t agree with. For instance, “The English translation should not be changed, because I feel better with the present translation.”
The second paragraph above should state: “If we were to simply go by what is for the “true good of the faithful” almost anything could be inserted into the liturgy, or allowed to remain there unchanged. As a rite that communicates grace from outward signs, and signs which must be clear and simple, the liturgy must not present signs which are merely emotionally fulfilling.”
I was trained as an altar server in 1956. At that time, I was told that the server’s Confiteor at the foot of the altar was the server’s confession and that the server’s Confiteor before communion was done as the people’s representative and that it was important to keep this in mind. Therefore, when the Confiteor before communion was eliminated, I was scandalized and lost much sleep over it. Was I no longer fulfilling my mission of representing the people? Now, perhaps what I was taught was the personal theology of the nun who instructed me and had no basis in fact. I didn’t now that then and I don’t know it now. All I know is that without the pre-communion Confiteor, something doesn’t seem right and no matter how much theologising I hear against it, that doesn’t change my feelings. That said, of course, this should not be all about my feelings, and I agree. I’m just saying it was all very hard on a 14-year-old boy who loved the Mass.
“As far as frequently repeating this prayer on the grounds that “one can never confess enough,” it can be a symptom of spiritual OCD, otherwise known as scrupulosity.
Sooner or later we have to get our eyes off ourselves and onto God’s forgiveness.”
There is nothing scrupulous about not being able to confess enough and knowing this. There is everything scrupulous about not really believing it. That is the peculiar pride of the scrupulous conscience. After all, it is precisly the realization of not being able to accuse ourselves enough, I’m speaking about a true realization rooted in humilty, that propels us forward in the hope of God’s Mercy. Without this it is nothing but presumption.
A Legitimate Liturgist priest-scholar (who gave a conference on Chant at which I met the most wonderful Fr. Z) holds that the ‘third Confiteor’ is a vestige–as Mr. Man With Black Hat notes above.
But there’s a bit more than his explanation.
Years ago, in a tradition going back many MORE years, a number of the Faithful would arrive at the early weekday Mass just in time for Communion. They were called “daily Communicants.” (Yes, I’m old enough to remember them, including being able to name several from my home parish..) Don’t ask me how that started, or why. I don’t know.
Anyhoo, that ‘third Confiteor’ was there for them, too.
Now, few (if any) people are “daily communicants” in that way; most are able to attend the entire Mass.
As to B-16 “indulging” the practice: I’d be very interested in seeing documentation of that claim.
Finally, it is supremely ironic that a certain Order of priests (based offshore) demands–and I mean DEMANDS–obedience from the laity on issues large and small–yet flagrantly and knowingly DIS-obeys the 1962 Rubrics on this matter.
Some things never change.
Fr. Sotelo wrote: “The comment I hear from people in these blogs is ‘but I feel good when the 2nd confiteor is done. They should never have changed it.’”
That is not what I am seeing from people above. I am reading many comments about the liturgical point of the 3rd/final Confiteor: that is, it is the one for the people receiving communion. Not for the priest (1st Confiteor) and not for the server (2nd Confiteor). So if there is a congregation to receive communion, the final Confiteor is said with the final absolution. If not, then no. Archbishop Bugnini did not give a reason when he hacked off that prayer — he did so without sufficient explanation, so now we have the mess to clean up.
As an aside I find it interesting that most traditional Latin Masses that have a priest who will not allow the 3rd/final Confiteor still recite the Prayers After Low Mass. If you’re going to do one, do both — they were each deleted in the same Bugnini package. The latter, however, features the congregation making vocal responses, my guess as to why more liberally-minded TLM priests are apt to keep them while scrapping the final Confiteor.
When my family attended the Indult Mass in my youth, the priest followed the rubrics for the 1962 missal so there was no 3rd Confiteor. If the Confiteor before Communion was for the people (as some have stated), it makes sense that it would be omitted at some point during the liturgical renewal of the 20th century. No matter how the Confiteor became part of the prayers at the foot of the altar, by the 1960′s, hand missals and textbooks and the example of the Dialogue Mass had taught the laity that the altar boy’s Confiteor was their Confiteor too. If Rome has given permission for the insertion of the 3rd Confiteor in the 1962 Missal, great. If not, please don’t do it because some of us don’t like illicit practices, even in the name of tradition.
//…some of us don’t like illicit practices…//
Alice: From my reading of Fr. Z’s comments and the comments of other contributors, it seems that the situation is not one of illicitness but of allowing something that is not explicitly forbidden. If the final Confiteor was explicitly forbidden, then it would be illicit – but it doesn’t sound to me like it’s explicitly forbidden. It may merely be regarded as irregular, but acceptable. For example, if I intentionally start a fire in a restaurant I would violate the law. But, there are many other things I could do in a restaurant that would not be illegal but would also not be acceptable. Just as there are things that are not explicitly allowed by the law that are, nonetheless, perfectly acceptable. Perhaps Fr. Z will clarify.
Not for the priest (1st Confiteor) and not for the server (2nd Confiteor).
The altar servers, like the choir, are representatives of the faithful. The confiteor that they say during the Prayers at the foot of the altar are said on behalf of the people AND for themselves.
is not one of illicitness but of allowing something that is not explicitly forbidden
Say the black, do the red.
What Jesuit school trained you?
The latest fashion from our NO pastor is to leave out the first Confiteor….
wolfeken: There is in the sacred liturgy a communal prayer led by the priest, acting in the person of Christ but also acting on behalf of the members of the Church, which is directed to the praise and glory of the Father in the power of the Holy Spirit. During certain parts of the Mass, the Church asks the people to actively join in, and at other parts to allow the priest alone to speak on behalf of the people through Christ, with Him, and in Him.
In Sacrosanctum Concilium, the Church asks that all the prayers recited by the priest be seen as prayers on behalf of the people, not “his prayers, the servers’ prayers, the servers’ or priest’s prayers on behalf of the people.” The liturgy is not meant to be chopped up into compartments which certain people posses as their special property. So technically, we only need one confiteor, and one of everything else.
As far as the Low Mass prayers, those are not part of the liturgy and are not relevant to a discussion of rubrics, per se. In the 1962 Missal, it is not required to follow Low Mass with the Leonine prayers, but since Mass is finished at that point, the priest and people are free to engage in any devotional actions they may wish without violating any Mass rubric. The Church encourages, outside of Mass, any and all devotional prayers, including the reciting of the Leonine prayers. On the other hand, the pre-Communion Confiteor is part of rubrics within the Mass, and the insistence on including it is a violation of the rubric. I don’t know why we must dispense ourselves from “Say the black, do the red” at this part of the liturgy but not others. It is very simple. The priest and servers at Mass should not be doing what is not prescribed.
Father Z wrote, “However, the 1962MR does not have the 2nd Confiteor before Holy Communion. In many places, I would guess most places, it is done anyway regardless.”
I do believe this is the case, as I attend the EF at a FSSP parish and the Confiteor is always there before Holy Communion. At every FSSP Mass I’ve ever been to, in fact, this has been the case.; the commenter did not say anything about other Western Liturgies or about the Eastern Liturgies. Certainly other approved liturgies are worthy of our attention, but isn’t it okay to prefer one Rite over another? Especially if the preferred Rite is a commonly accepted Rite of the region where one lives, and more importantly, if the preferred Rite is celebrated in the parish or diocese where one lives? Additionally, the title “the Mass of the Ages” has, for quite some time, been understood to refer to the EF form of the Mass.
Pretty good discussion here.
As a member of a Schola, I find myself grateful every week for the Confiteor before Holy Communion. Why? During the 1st confiteor, I’m busy singing either an Introit or a Kyrie, so the extra recollection is very helpful.
Chris
Several things,
1. I do not know what the current status of the prayers after low Mass are, but in 1962 they were no optional. They could, however, be omitted in certain cases (when the Mass is followed by Benediction or a procession, when a sermon is given, when the Mass is celebrated with more solemnity-e.g. a nuptial Mass, etc). This at least is what the most recent edition of Fortescue-O’Connell-Reid states, as well as the Ceremonies of the Mass by O’Connell
2. The FSSP follows a very simply rule in general here. Where it was retained as custom, the 2nd/3rd confiteor is said in their Masses. Where it was not so retained they do not re-introduce it. Hence the different experiences of different people
3. Wolfeken- assuming the 3rd Confietor is still allowed in 1962, it is certainly permissible to chant it. The rubrics do not direct this, but custom sanctions it. We make a mistake when we read rubrics as if they were American laws. For instance, according to the rubrics a processional cross is used only in Pontifical Masses and a few Masses a year (e.g. Palm Sunday). Yet in English speaking countries the use of such a cross is common place. Or again, according to the rubrics the bell at Mass is rung a) at the sanctus, b) sometime shortly before the consecration c) either once continually, or three times for each elevation. d) Shortly before communion to single to the faithful who may wish to receive to come up. The exact manner (e.g. at the Hanc Igitur) is not determined, and custom admits a variety of other rings.
To all- In the Ceremonies of the Roman Rite, Canon O’Connell has an excellent chapter on rubrics and custom. Read it before you start accusing priests of disobedience. Or else get equally worked up about a processional cross being used, the omission of the Sanctus candle, or the use of more than one server at low Mass of a priest (actually that last one was reprobated several times by the SRC, who allowed the use of more than one only when there was a just cause)
4. As a point of fact, it is not disobedience to have the 3rd Confiteor. I wrote the Society of St. John Cantius about this (and have talked to various priests, e.g. Fr. Berg, FSSP). Fr. Scott Haynes, SJC gave me this.
Now I would like to see said copy of the SCR decree and obviously can only trust that what this priest wrote me is true, but I think it is downright scandalous and indeed the utmost disrespect to the priests of the FSSP or ICR to call them disobedient. You would have to claim also that priests of the SCJ, FSSP, et al. are liars. It may well be legitimate to wonder about how this works, to ask a priest if he can show you where permission is had or point you in the right direction, etc. But to jump to, as many com-box attackers have here, accusations of disobedience is abhorrent
To clarify: what I have been told by the FSSP is that they were given permission for it where it was still customary upon their arrival (whether that means a pre-existing Latin Mass group, or, as with the SCJ, it was done in the 1960′s I do not know). My understanding is that they don’t want to “rock the boat” too much with communities that expect it.
I use my father’s 1954 missal at Mass, and expected the 2nd Confiteor – and I got it at the regular Friday Mass I attend. I did notice one week when I forgot the Missal, that it was not in the LMS version. I also saw it at the FSSP Masses.
I like it, because I am occasionally prone to distraction and thus venial sin at Mass, that I love to feel that I am confessing and receiving absolution quietly at the point I have finally decided to receive Communion. I am not over-scrupulous – it just feels right.
I
Of course, our priest simply removes the first confiteor from our O.F. Mass and dispenses with the whole problem…
\\)….\\
In the Apostles’ Creed, it says, “I believe in the forgiveness of sins…..” Does that not mean we are required to believe that (should the spiritual conditions be met) our sins are forgiven?
*; **
It is one thing to love or prefer one particular rite and spiritual tradition of the Church. I make no secret that I love the Byzantine tradition. This does not mean I do not respect the other authorized Liturgies of the Church, and assist at them as I am able.
However, I have noticed that aficionados of the Extraordinary Form frequently use the term “mass of the/all ages” to assert that is it somehow inherently superior to the Ordinary Form, if not all the other authorized Eucharistic Liturgies as well. In my experience, many of such people have not even HEARD that there are Eastern Liturgies, or even non-Roman Western liturgies, but are merely using “mass of the/all ages” in a triumphalist way.
Others labor under the mistaken and outdated notion that the Roman Rite somehow has some kind of pre-eminence or priority or perfection, and the more an Eastern liturgy is assimilated to it, the more “perfect” it is.
It seems there is plenty of reason to say that the 2nd/3rd Confiteor is legitimate. The Leonine prayers are basically a “prescribed” devotional, but I don’t see why we do not just keep them going. I do not see any reason to throw around terms like “disobedient” and so forth. It is especially quite beautiful at a Solemn High Mass.
As to the other liturgies and the “Mass of the Ages”, at least in my experience, other TLM fans also appreciate the other traditional liturgies-East and West. However, it is just the way it is that the Latin Rite has the preeminence in that it is the most wide spread. When most people think “Catholic” they think of the Roman Rite. Even in the secular world, when they want to paint something as Catholic (especially in film) it is often in varying degrees of the pre-Vatican II Roman trappings. Its basically shorthand to speak of all things Roman as preeminently Catholic, inaccurate yes, but resonate with lived collective experience.
Much thanks for the original post and all of the comments.
I recently moved to a parish which includes a traditional Latin Mass in its Sunday Mass schedule. Having grown up with the Latin Mass (Vatican II began when I was in grade school), I was very pleased to dig out my old Latin-English missal again. But I was really puzzled by the “extra” Confiteor right before Communion. I had never experienced that before. So I was really wondering what was up.
It’s nice to have some of the historical background now.
Dear Joshua08:
Thank you for your contribution on the last confiteor; it ought to be more widely known.
Sincerely,
John Pepino
When the Confiteor was dropped as part of Blessed John XXIII’s revised rubrics in 1960, permission was given shortly after by the Sacred Congregation of Rites to continue the second Confiteor, where it was an established custom.
Fine, assuming that there WAS such a custom, uninterrupted. And I’m sure you can supply a citation, which would be interesting for all parties.
But when it is re-instated despite strict obedience to the 1962 rubrics (from 1962-200X), the argument from “custom” is void. That is a case, by the way, with which I am intimately familiar. (The disobedience extends to using the “Benedicamus Domino” at all Masses during Lent and Advent, another practice which was deleted, and there are other seriously questionable practices which I won’t discuss here.)
Then we have ‘disobedience’, plain and simple.
And if one digs around enough, one discovers that the 3rd Confiteor had been dropped (de facto) in most cases because there WAS NO celebration of the EF from ~1969 to ~2000. How can one claim “uninterrupted custom” with a 30-year gap?
The origin of the practice was thoroughly explained above–which also thoroughly explains the reason(s) it was dropped. (See Black Hat’s entry.)
The Roman Ritual as late as 1964 still provides for the use of the Confiteor before the reception of Holy Communion by the faithful as an option
That was covered under my entry for “Daily Communicants” who did NOT attend the entire Mass.
You’re applying legislation to the wrong case.
dad29: Very good point. A custom is something that should endure for years, and yet if the EF has been gone all those years in most communities, how can one claim a “custom” as reason to continue the confiteor right before Communion?
Beyond the issues of “oh well, it’s already a custom here” or “we don’t want to confuse the faithful” there is the tendency of priests to simply do what they wish to do at the liturgy. This is actually not willful disobedience. It is simply a tendency of many priests, both liberal and traditionalist, to do things during Mass that they sincerely believe are for the good of the faithful and fall under “epikeia” or prudential judgment. The thinking is to make up your mind on a liturgical practice, and then build a theological or legal rationalization around it, or find refuge in obscure indults, special permissions, etc. I find that disagreeable, but that is simply how priests tend to think when they deal with liturgical practices which they feel like/insist on doing.
Dad29,
I believe that the SSPX has reinserted the pre-Communion Confiteor since their founding, so in some places it is “established custom.” If a priest in union with the local bishop offers the EF in a place where the SSPX has been established for a while, I can see why Rome might have given permission for this priest to reinsert this Confiteor. I just don’t know that Rome HAS given such permission and without it, it should not be done.
Fr. Basil,
Thank you for not ascribing to malice would could be ascribed to ignorance, but I am not sure that is always (or even often) the case. I can still get worked up about one book I read by a Latin Rite triumphalist who argued that since the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom was only published 10 years before the Council of Trent, it didn’t fall under the established tradition exception or remembering how our priest told us that there were no rubrics in the Divine Liturgy so the priest was even freer to do whatever he wanted than in the Novus Ordo. Many people are ignorant about the different variants of the Western Mass, which are older than the Mass which Abp. Lefebvre called the “Mass of All-Time” but at least in the circles I found myself there was an active dislike for the non-Latin liturgies.
This is actually not willful disobedience. It is simply a tendency of many priests, both liberal and traditionalist, to do things during Mass that they sincerely believe are for the good of the faithful and fall under “epikeia” or prudential judgment.
Yes, well….
Sometimes that ‘confiteor’ issue is part of a larger pattern of willful deviations from established norms, in which case(s) “closing one’s eyes” is imprudent–and people are obligated to speak out.
I understand “pastoral” considerations. But at the same time, expecting the laity to live to standards and at the same time being a bit………flaccid……..seems to me to be a dangerous path. Which rules are to be obeyed? Which are to be gently ignored?
And no, I’m not talking “salvation is at risk” here, but still……VatII places very great weight on the Mass.
dad29: And therein lies the controversy over the pre-Communion confiteor. There is an unspoken assumption in the EF Mass world that the present Magisterium should indeed be gently ignored, at times, in matters regarding the liturgy. To repeat a favorite mantra of many people, “the novus ordo is a big joke. What right do novus ordo hierarchy and priests have to question the Mass of the Ages?” Of course, Fr. Z doesn’t tolerate that disrespect in his blog, but it doesn’t mean that many folks do not quietly think that way towards the present Magisterium.
I can understand why the FSSP would gravitate to reciting the last confiteor. The SSPX recite the pre-Communion confiteor, and for many they are still the true standard of what is Catholic. And sad to say, the FSSP is at times dogged with the accusation that they are not really as Catholic as the SSPX, that they are compromised, watered down, and not as free as SSPX to be true defenders of tradition. That is not my opinion, by the way; I deeply admire the FSSP. But if the FSSP tell their priests to not recite the pre-Communion confiteor, it does leave them vulnerable to the accusation that they are indult wannabees who are prepared to act just like the “indult priests” who are not true priests but “presbyters.” In some ways, reciting the pre-Communion confiteor is a way to say, “see, we still offer a true Catholic Mass.”
I still don’t buy, Joshua08, the argument that custom allows the final Confiteor to be sung in a non-pontifical High Mass. The missal is very clear as to what is sung and what is not. And it (or the Pontificale Ceremoniale) very clearly says the final Confiteor is to be sung at a pontifical High Mass.
If a “custom” arises to sing this pontifical privilege at a regular High Mass, then what is to stop a “custom” of singing the final blessing?
As far as those who claim the traditional Latin Mass was “gone” from 1969 to 2007′ish, it is possible that it was gone from your world, but recall the people who worked to get the 1970 Agatha Christie indult, the JPII 1984/88 indults and the Benedict motu proprio have been saying/hearing this Mass validly in one location or another non-stop. Please don’t assume the Mass magically re-started when you attended the novus ordo. To that end, it absolutely makes sense to say the old SCR permission for a final Confiteor still applies.
In some ways, reciting the pre-Communion confiteor is a way to say, “see, we still offer a true Catholic Mass.”
Umnnhhh….see today’s post on this very blog.
.
—wherein “he” is B-16, speaking to the Bishops of Italy.
There is no real dilemma here, just as there is no ‘dilemma’ in stating that “He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood…”. Either take it or leave it. There was no ‘pastoral shimmy’ in those words, good Father.
By the way, I’m sure you’ve noticed that no one has YET come up with a citation “indulging” this practice. Moreover, it is irrelevant what SSPX does or did. Their abuse of the Liturgy cannot license another abuse of the Liturgy, can it?
Ah, well.
This video from the 1940′s shows the chanting of the 2nd confiteor. I again urge that people pick up a copy of O’Connell (pre-1962 versions are at least online) and read what he says of custom. Try to stop thinking like a modern about prescriptive law, and start thinking remembering that custom can even abrogate the laws of Councils, and is the best interpreter of laws and makes laws. As I said in my post above, I can only trust what I have been told when I inquired. It is extremely unhealthy, arrogant and misplaced for a layman to jump to accusing any of these priests of disobedience. If you go to a Mass where the 2nd confiteor is done, inquire if you must, but don’t presume that your amateur reading of rubrics is the end all and be all of how things are to be done. Or else get rid of processional crosses, using more than one server at a low Mass and various other things that are clearly customs against the rubrics.
I do not claim to know with certitude that every use of the 2nd confiteor is legitimate. But it is not my worry or concern. I do know that both the SSPX and FSSP do it only where the congregation expects it….and considering that custom arises from the ground up, is not imposed by a priest and can gain the force of law even when against a law (depending on the case) I hesitate to censure anyone. The FSSP claims that Ecclesia Dei greenlighted this policy (see ). Perhaps they are lying. But that would be presumption to assume that. And again, rubrics are not like American law. Say the black, do the red has its use, but law in the Catholic sense is rooted in custom and not merely the vis verborum. For instance, a single genuflection is prescribed at benediction, but no one sane would rebuke a double genuflection there. Again, before the modifications of the GIRM in recent memory, we had the 1973 GIRM and against the rubric of that GIRM we continued kneeling after the Agnus Dei…Rome’s response? Perfectly alright to do! Heck, the new rubric is to bow (when standing) before receiving. But genuflection is fine ()
The short shrift: liturgical law, like any law really, is not just “black and red” in that what is “red” is in part determined, expanded, etc by custom
BTW, the SSPX originally did not do the 2nd Confiteor. They bowed to the custom of places where they were establishing their apostolates.
It is extremely unhealthy, arrogant and misplaced for a layman to jump to accusing any of these priests of disobedience.
Not if that layman is being advised by very senior liturgical Ph.D’s, fella.
And please recall that one CAN licitly judge actions. When I see you fatally shoot your mother, I can say, with no hesitation, that you murdered your mother. There may be mitigating circumstances, but it doesn’t change the fact.
The FSSP says they have a letter from E.D. allowing their variation. I’m willing to believe that. But that letter does NOT apply to others–and since we can’t see the letter, we don’t even know if it applies only to that particular parish, or to the FSSP in general, or to the FSSP only in the US.
Who are you calling fella? Please sir, do not presume you are talking to an uneducated dolt. If letters after a name count, I am not without them.
PhD’s in liturgy? I know a few myself (well more accurately S.T.L and S.T.D’s with a liturgical/sacramental theology emphasis). But most liturgists I know tend to think “traditional = bad” and also tend to have a very American understanding of the law. Note you have not addressed the issue of custom, which makes, abrogates and interprets laws. Church law is not as prescriptive as modern law.
The fact is you have admitted, you do not know. So please stop calumny. You have not seen that letter right…maybe it lays down a general principle, may not. Who knows? I do not. But neither do you. And if it is a personal rescript one can possibly argue they would get the same response (assuming similar circumstances) and act on it. Who are you to say it does not apply? Church law is, despite its codification, not yet modern, despite your protestations.
And again, do you work at suppressing having two servers at low Mass? Not only is that against the rubrics, but on several occasions (e.g. 1953) the SRC reprobated the use of more than one with certain exceptions. There you have a clear and unequivocal abuse. Now go at it and foam at the mouth and cry abuse. Take away those processional crosses, and tackle servers that carry the thurible during the recessional and fight against all those horrendous abuses.
What no? No one cares about the fact that those practices are contra rubricam? Instead they like to attack only the issue of the second confiteor? Why is that?
Custom?
It is clear that in the vast majority of the cases here and abroad, “custom” has nothing to do with it.
You claim that “custom” is in place when the EF was not celebrated for 30 (or more) years. Well, OK. Then perhaps the custom of celebrating Mass on the hood of a Jeep for armed forces should be revived. It’s only been in dis-use since the end of the Korean War, after all.
Curious that you crusade against one “custom”–that of using 2 altar servers–while frothing and spittle-spewing over those who are disturbed by another “custom.”
Calumniator, indeed.

Republicans have plenty of problems to deal with from news from the past 24-48 hours. I’m going to center my focus around the swine flu infections because it provides an interesting related topic to most of them.
Republicans have spent some of their energy the past two years denouncing any efforts to plan or prepare for a possible influenza epidemic, even though the probability of one occurring continues to mount. It’s an offshoot of their anti-science agenda and it’s left the country in a worse state than it otherwise should be in. As cases of swine flu infections continue to increase, most Americans are rightfully worried about the topic. The swine flu can obviously be transferred from swine to humans, something that isn’t terribly shocking in an of itself if you’ve paid attention to how influenze evolves. The scary question now, and in any potential influenze epidemic, is how transferable is the flu from person to person? What is the rate of infection between people? The higher that rate, the more strained our health management system becomes. Side-topic: if it were actually a health-care system, people might be less worried.
One shameful aspect of this story is the actions of Maine’s Senator Susan Collins, a self-styled “moderate”. I’ve argued for a number of years now that many elected officials aren’t “moderate” in the sense that they once were or in ways that are relevant in today’s political climate. For instance, how “moderate” is it for Sen. Collins to extoll her efforts to remove a $900 million pandemic preparedness proposal from President Obama’s recovery bill? Further, how “moderate” is it for Sen. Collins to have removed any record of doing so from her website? Either she believes she did the morally right thing in preventing some “wasteful spending” from making it through the Congress or she doesn’t. Now that we have a potential epidemic on our hands, she isn’t, though she was even a few short days ago. That isn’t principled and it isn’t moderate. She was sucking up to the extremist Cons in her party until it became painfully obvious that she would be rightfully targeted by a majority of the public for doing so. What happens if the outbreak spreads and real people end up dying and the economy further suffers? How proud will Sen. Collins be of her anti-spending stance then?
Another shameful aspect of this story is the lack of a Health and Human Services Secretary. Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius was nominated months ago, but the extremist, obstructionist, ‘Party of No’ had placed an unwarranted hold on her nomination due to her pro-choice stance. That hold was in place until today, when the Senate suddenly moved her nomination forward and approved her. Again, a group of extremist Con Senators were doing their best to placate their extremist anti-woman base by denying Gov. Sebelius’ nomination until it looked like it would be very politically stupid to continue to do so. Sec. Sebelius didn’t gain any special skills overnight. None of her views changed. Neither did those of the Senators holding her nomination back. Sec. Sebelius won’t be running around the country forcing women to have abortions that they don’t want to have. The Con Senators were simply more interested in proving how ideologically pure they were; they were determined to show the American people that the government really doesn’t work, dammit, until a potential crisis erupted.
This behavior is disgusting. Again, if Americans end up dying and if the rest of us end up suffering due to any lack of emergency preparedness that otherwise would have been in place or due to the lack of leadership of a Health Secretary, the ramifications for the extremists shouldn’t be pretty. Already a weak regional party, they will reduce Americans’ confidence in their ability to handle anything above tying their own shoes. And they’ll have only themselves to blame.
Isn’t it amazing what a little crisis can do?
